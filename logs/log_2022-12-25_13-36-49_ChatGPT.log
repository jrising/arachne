> Can children take communion in Lutheran churches?
**assistant**:
> In the Lutheran Church, children are generally welcome to receive Holy Communion, which is also known as the Eucharist or the Lord's Supper. The Lutheran Church teaches that in Holy Communion, Christians receive the true body and blood of Jesus Christ, under the bread and wine, for the forgiveness of sins and the strengthening of their faith. Children who have been baptized and have received instruction in the Christian faith are generally considered to be ready to receive Communion.
> 
> In many Lutheran churches, children are encouraged to participate in Communion starting at a young age, either by receiving a blessing or by receiving the bread and wine. Children who have not yet been baptized may receive a blessing instead of Communion.
> 
> It is important to note that the practice of children receiving Communion varies among different Lutheran churches and traditions. Some Lutheran churches may have specific guidelines or requirements for children to receive Communion, such as completing a certain amount of instruction or reaching a certain age. It is always a good idea to check with your local Lutheran church for more information on their specific practices and requirements.
