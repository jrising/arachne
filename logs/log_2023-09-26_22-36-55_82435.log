**user**:
> If I have a logistic growth function, dS/dt = r S (1 - S / K), I will get negative growth if S > K. I interpret that as death in the stock due to overpopulation. Is there a term for that that is related to the over-density of the stock?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is a term for it. It's called "density-dependent regulation" or "density-dependent mortality". This concept is often used in ecology and pertains to the effect on growth rates (or death rates, in your case) that results from the changing population density in a particular environment. When the population (or stock, in your case) becomes too large, resources become limited, and competition intensifies, leading to slower growth rates or even negative growth. In a logistic growth model, this effect is represented by the term (1 - S/K), signifying the proportional reduction in growth rate as the population density (S) approaches the carrying capacity (K).
