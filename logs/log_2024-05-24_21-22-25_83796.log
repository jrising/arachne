> How can I pull out any numbers in brackets from a string in python? I'd like to call a function for each number I find, and replace the number with the output of that function.
**assistant**:
> You can use Python's `re` module to find numbers in brackets within a string and replace them with the output of a function. Here's an example:
> 
> 1. Define a function that will process the found numbers.
> 2. Use `re.sub` with a custom replacement function to search for the pattern of numbers in brackets and replace them accordingly.
> 
> Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
> 
> ```python
> import re
> 
> def process_number(number):
>     # Replace this with your actual function logic
>     return str(int(number) * 2)  # Example: doubling the number
> 
> def replace_numbers_in_brackets(text):
>     def replacer(match):
>         number = match.group(1)  # Extract the number from the match
>         return process_number(number)
>         
>     # Regex pattern to find numbers in brackets
>     pattern = re.compile(r'\[(\d+)\]')
>     
>     # Substitute using the replacer function
>     result = pattern.sub(replacer, text)
>     return result
> 
> # Example usage
> text = "Here are some numbers [123] and [456] in brackets."
> processed_text = replace_numbers_in_brackets(text)
> print(processed_text)  # Output should be: "Here are some numbers 246 and 912 in brackets."
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> - `process_number(number)` is the function that you want to call for each number. Modify it to match your actual processing logic.
> - The `replacer` function extracts the number using `match.group(1)`, calls `process_number` with this number, and returns the resulting value as a string.
> - The regex pattern `r'\[(\d+)\]'` matches numbers inside brackets.
> - `re.sub` uses the `replacer` function to replace each match of the pattern in the input string.
> 
> Adjust the `process_number` function according to your specific needs.
