> When I use groupby in pandas, how can I return multiple values, like the reframe function in dplyr? Specifically, I have a year column and a value column, and I want to interpolate these values, and return a new set of values for a new year column and value column.
**assistant**:
> In pandas, you could use the `groupby` function similar to how you'd use `reframe` with dplyr in R, however the syntax is a bit different. Here, I'm assuming that the interpolations will be performed within each group, and for that, you might use the `.apply()` method with a custom function.

> For the scenario you described, let's define a sample DataFrame first:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> import numpy as np
> df = pd.DataFrame({
>     'group': ['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C'],
>     'year': [2000, 2002, 2004, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2000, 2002, 2004],
>     'value': [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9],
> })
> ```
> 
> Then, define a function to interpolate your data:
> 
> ```python
> def interpolate_group(data, new_years):
>     new_data = pd.DataFrame({'year': new_years})
>     new_data = new_data.set_index('year')
>     old_data = data.set_index('year')
>     new_data['value'] = old_data['value'].interpolate(method='linear')
>     return new_data.reset_index()
> ```
> 
> You may then use `groupby` and `apply` to execute this function for each group:
> 
> ```python
> new_years = range(2000, 2005)
> df_grouped = df.groupby('group').apply(interpolate_group, new_years=new_years).reset_index()
> ```
> 
> The `df_grouped` should now hold your interpolated data for each group across the new range of years you've specified.
> 
> Please replace the 'linear' method with the interpolation method that fits your needs. And modify the `new_years` range as per your requirements.
> 
> I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification.
