> How do you use Julia's ProgressMeter in a Monte Carlo loop?
**assistant**:
> The `ProgressMeter` package in Julia provides an easy way to visualize the progress of a loop. You can use it to track the progress of a Monte Carlo loop in the following way:
> 
> ```julia
> using ProgressMeter
> 
> # Number of iterations
> n_iterations = 100000
> 
> # Progress bar
> progress = Progress(n_iterations, 1)
> 
> # Monte Carlo loop
> for i in 1:n_iterations
>     # Do some calculations
>     # ...
> 
>     # Update the progress bar
>     next!(progress)
> end
> ```
> 
> The `Progress` function creates a new progress bar object with `n_iterations` iterations. The second argument, `1`, sets the update interval to 1 iteration, which means that the progress bar will be updated after every iteration. The `next!` function is then used to update the progress bar after each iteration.
> 
> With this code, you'll see a progress bar in the terminal that shows the percentage of iterations completed. The bar will update after each iteration, providing a visual indication of how far along the loop is.
