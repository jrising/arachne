> ## Defining the Coast from an Economic Point-of-View: Coast-related Economic Activity
> 
> Understanding the contributions of Delaware’s coast-related activity to the economy of the state requires a careful identification of what constitutes “coast-related activity.” Delaware is a marine‐oriented state, with no part more than eight miles from tidal waters. It has a rich coastal environment, with 24 miles of ocean coastline and 381 miles of tidal shoreline including coastal bays, tributaries, and Delaware Bay. Delaware is one of 30 states identified as a “coastal state,” and in a broad sense, all three counties are regarded as coastal. In addition, all Delaware watersheds are considered coastal because they drain directly into the ocean, Chesapeake Bay, or Delaware Bay. However, such broad definition of the coast would require the inclusion of all the economic activity in the state, which would overstate the extent of coast-related activity. The example of beachfront activities points us toward a narrow definition based on close proximity to the coast. However, the examples in the Introduction identified a broader geographic scope where coast-related activity may occur.
> 
> Our approach to measuring coast-related activity is similar to the approach of other analysts such as Charles Colgan, who proposed that the coastal economy is that portion of economic activity that takes place on or near the coast.
> 
> In addition, Colgan notes that the coastal economy has a geographical aspect and consists of a particular set of economic activities within a larger region. Postal zip code areas are the smallest geographic units for which the kinds of economic data required for our analysis (employment, production, incomes, and taxes) are available.
> 
> Fortunately, there is commercially available, highly professional software that can calculate all of the economic impacts for areas of the United States as small as zip code areas. We used a well-known and widely used example of this software—described later in this report—for our project.
> 
> Thus, we turn to zip code areas to construct our geographic region that contains coast-related activity.3 Four zip code areas that border the coast—19930, 19944, 19958, and 19971—are areas we have identified as containing the most directly coast-related activities.  These zip code areas are shown on the map on page 6.  Coast-related activity can be measured in terms of all the employment, production, incomes, and taxes from these coastal zip code areas.
> 
> In addition, we expand the geographic region of potential coast-related activities to include the zip code areas (19939, 19945, 19947, 19951, 19963, 19966, 19967, 19968, 19969, 19970, and 19975) that border the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay or contain concentrations of activities supporting coast-related activities. They are considered part of the coastal economy because of the coast-related activities they contain. However, the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay area also contain many non-coast-related activities—especially agriculture, including poultry processing. Thus in order to not give economic impact credit for agriculture and other strictly non-coast-related activities, we select only coast-related activities that occur in the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay zip code areas (this is Colgan’s “specific economy” within a larger region).  This approach enables us to incorporate the fact that “the coast” or “coastal economy” is moving inland due to finite coastal real estate, lower real estate prices farther inland, and continuing population growth. To identify coast-related activity in the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay zip code areas, we focus on the businesses in specific industries located in these areas.  What are coast-related industries? The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a list of industries identified as coast-related.4 Other studies of coast-related activities have also produced their own lists of industries, which may differ, to some extent, from the BLS list. In addition to the BLS list, we also relied on a list produced as part of a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts.5 The BLS and Massachusetts lists imply that all businesses in the identified industries in the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay area should be considered coast-related. However, this procedure would overstate the magnitude of coast-related activities. For example, even the commercial fishing industry in Delaware, which both BLS and Massachusetts would identify as coast-related, includes activities not related to the coast (those related purely to Delaware Bay and Delaware River). Thus we examined each of the industries identified by BLS and Massachusetts that are part of the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay economy and included as coast-related only the proportion of the industry’s employment, output, income, and taxes that might be reasonably included in Delaware’s coast-related activity. We also examined the industries and individual businesses in coastal Sussex County excluded by both BLS and Massachusetts and found some among them (e.g., amusement and water parks, residential construction, medical, legal, and insurance services) that had coast-related components. We added reasonable proportions of those activities excluded by BLS and Massachusetts but nonetheless had distinct and obvious coast-related aspects in our study areas.

> 
> Another recent report covering a somewhat similar geographic region used this as its description:
> ---
> ## Inland Bays Study Region
> 
> The Inland Bays study region was defined as the land area in the eleven ZIP Codes surrounding the three Inland Bays (Figure 1). The eleven ZIP Codes that were selected are those immediately adjacent to or within three miles of the Inland Bays. ZIP Codes were used to define the study region due to the public availability of “business pattern data” for individual ZIP Codes.
> 
> ZIP code areas adjacent to both the Delaware Inland Bays and the coastal ocean were divided to separate economic activity derived from the ocean from that of the Inland Bays. This delineation generally follows Delaware Route 1 north from the Delaware-Maryland border. This delineation intentionally excludes the seaward portions of ZIP Codes for Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Bethany Beach, and Fenwick Island where economic activity and water-related benefits are more likely to be related to the ocean than to the Inland Bays. Based on this boundary, approximately 92% of the land area within the eleven selected ZIP Codes was included within the Inland Bays study region.
> 
> ## Relevant Industries
> 
> For the study region, relevant industries were selected from three categories: (1) those that are water-related, (2) tourism and recreation, and (3) those necessary to support residents that live in proximity to the Inland Bays, visitors, and those moving to the region (e.g., infrastructure and services) (Table 1). Water-related activities include commercial shellfish fishing, seafood markets, boat dealers, and marinas.
> 
> Industries related to tourism and recreation include accommodations (e.g., hotels and motels, bed and breakfasts, campgrounds, etc.), travel agencies, and recreational goods rentals (e.g., kayak rental companies, bait and tackle stores, fishing charters, etc.). Residential infrastructure and services include construction, general merchandise stores, health and personal care stores, grocery stores, gasoline stations, and real estate agencies, among others.  An example of an important industry within the study region that was deemed largely unrelated to the Inland Bays economy and thus was excluded is agriculture.

Explicitly cite the 2012 report (Latham & Lewis 2012) and the other report (Hauser & Bason 2022), and leave technical details (the specific zip codes) out, referring to the appendix for these.
**assistant**:
> **III. Study Region**
> 
> Our geographical scope mirrors the framework laid out by Latham & Lewis in their 2012 report. They defined the coastal economy as the economic activities occurring either on or in the vicinity of the coast, limited to specific postal zip codes (see Appendix for details). While the entirety of Delaware is a marine-oriented state with all parts in proximity to tidal waters, we adopt a more focused approach to avoid overstatement of coastal economic activity. Therefore, the study region is primarily based on areas with direct coastal adjacency, featuring heightened concentrations of coast-related activities.
> 
> This report's study region comprises two categories. First, there are zip code areas directly bordering the coast which are home to the most immediate and direct coast-related activities. Secondly, we include additional zip code areas bordering the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay, plus those containing clusters of activities that support coast-related commerce. While these inland areas engage in diverse economic activities, such as agriculture, our focus lies strictly on coast-related activities within these regions. This choice aligns with the migration of the coastal economy inland, as influenced by constraints on coastal real estate, less expensive real estate further inland, and ongoing population growth. 
> 
> Similar to the approach adopted by Hauser & Bason in their 2022 study, we considered an array of industries within these regions to define our study region. We selected industries falling under three broad categories: (1) water-related activities, (2) tourism and recreation, and (3) infrastructure and services supporting local residents and visitors. Economic activities that are primarily ocean-related were systematically excluded from the study to maintain a clear focus on the Inland Bays' economy.
> 
> The challenge lies in accurately identifying and measuring the share of coastal activity within industries that could be deemed as coast-related. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other studies, including one conducted by the University of Massachusetts, provided lists of such industries. Still, adhering strictly to these lists would inadvertently overstate coast-related activities as not all activities within these industries are tied to the coast. We performed a careful examination of each industry within the BLS and University of Massachusetts lists present in the Inland Bays and lower Delaware Bay economy. Only a proportion of each industry's employment, output, income, and taxes, that could reasonably be classified as coast-related, was included in our study. Furthermore, we included certain businesses and activities that, although not listed by BLS or Massachusetts, clearly contributed to the coastal economy within our study areas.
> 
> For precise geographic and industry details, please refer to the Appendix.

> This approach maintains the integrity of the data and ensures a more realistic representation of Delaware's coast-related economy, aiding in the accurate estimation of its economic contribution to the state as a whole.

**assistant**:
> In our methodology, we scrutinize economic activities across two distinct geographic regions - the coastal zip code areas and the inland areas - with differing approaches for each. 
> 
> For the coastal zip code areas, we consider all industries. Given the immediate adjacency to the coast, we assume that their activities would inherently have some level of coast-relatedness. The impact of each industry, in terms of employment, production, income, and taxes, is accounted for in its entirety within these coastal regions.
> 
> The inland areas, on the other hand, present a more nuanced scenario. Here, only a subset of industries is deemed coast-related, as informed by the approach in the 2012 report by Latham & Lewis. We borrow from their reliance on lists from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and a study from the University of Massachusetts, selecting industries that have a clear connection to coast-related activities. This includes sectors like vegetable and melon farming, commercial fishing, construction and maintenance, electric power generation and distribution, among others. The specific list of these industries is available in the Appendix.
> 
> Moreover, we recognize a need for detailed analysis on certain sectors, which may contribute significantly to the coastal economy or have substantial coast-related components. This approach is also consistent with the Latham & Lewis 2012 study. The sectors for this additional scrutiny include but are not limited to food services and drinking places, real estate rental and management, medical care facilities, and various retail stores. The detailed list and further categorization of these sectors can be found in the Appendix. 
> 
> By segmenting our study region and industry focus in this way, we aim to achieve a more granular and realistic understanding of the economic contribution of Delaware's coastal area.
**user**:
> Another subsection describes how the economic contribution of a region is understood, consisting of both the direct money spent there and the indirect and induced effects of that money. Here is the relevant section from the 2012 report:
> ---
> For the coastal economy we defined in the preceding paragraphs, we need measures of its magnitude. We measure the coastal economy in terms of jobs, payroll, output, and taxes. The totals of all coastal economy activities, in terms of any of the measures, are referred to as the direct effects. These direct effects lead to indirect and induced effects. The three effects together constitute the totality of “coast-related” economic activities.
> 
> Direct effects are the jobs, payroll, and output created directly by coastal economy activities—such as coastal businesses. Indirect effects are the additional jobs, payroll, and output created when a coastal business purchases goods and services from the many diverse businesses that support it. These businesses include equipment suppliers, construction services, transportation services, management services, food services, and many other types of support businesses.  Induced effects measure the additional jobs, payroll, and output created throughout the economy when the employees of a direct or indirect employer spend their personal incomes on consumer goods, other property, services, and taxes.
> 
> The relationship (the ratio) between the total impact of a coastal activity and its initial direct effect is a multiplier effect. Local firms purchase input supplies that they need for their businesses from other local firms. They pay their employees, who then also make local purchases. The initial spending has a ripple effect through the economy as successive rounds of spending and re-spending magnify its impact. In each round of spending and re-spending, some of the additional spending is lost from the local economy because some money goes into saving or non-local purchases. This is why multipliers have values for smaller regions (such as states) that are typically not as large as they are at the national level. A multiplier’s size depends on the residency of the workforce, the average wages paid, and the portion of intermediate purchases that are supplied locally.
> 
> A multiplier is simply the numerical relationship between an original change in economic activity and the ultimate change in activity that results as the money is spent and re-spent through various sectors of the economy. An example of “re-spending” in our analysis is when an employee of a coast business spends some of her wages on locally produced goods. The production of the goods the employee purchases, such as groceries or entertainment, is economic activity that can be indirectly attributed to the operations of the coast business. Thus, a one-dollar increase in local direct activity at the coast results in expansion of total economic activity of more than one dollar throughout the rest of the state.
> 
> There are several kinds of multipliers used to assess the economic impacts of any kind of activity. The main varieties, and the ones that we utilize in this report, are output multipliers, employment multipliers, and income multipliers. The effects of coast-related business activities can be measured in terms of the value of the output they produce, the number of individuals they employ, and the wages and salaries they pay to those employees. Just as one dollar of output produced by a coast-related business has a total effect of creating more than one dollar’s worth of output in the impact economy (this is the output multiplier), a single job at the coast business can be given credit for creating more than one job in the impact economy (this is the employment multiplier).6 Likewise, an additional dollar of wages paid to one coast employee results in more than one additional dollar of total income for the impact region’s households (this is the income multiplier).
> 
> Figure 1 illustrates the multiplier process. Coast-related expenditures are disbursed in four different ways: (1) to local government (which includes state government), (2) to other local firms, (3) to local households, and (4) as payments to non-local governments and firms.  The three local recipients of the disbursement will continue to spend this money in the same four ways over successive rounds of spending. Money that flows out of Delaware (e.g., purchases from non-Delaware suppliers, payments to non-Delaware employees, and non-Delaware taxes) leak out of the multiplier process so that eventually the effects of the original spending cease to cause additional increases.
> ---
> 
> And here is the section from the Inland Bays report:
> ---
> Under existing conditions, the economic contributions of the Inland Bays consist of clear, direct effects, such as businesses and jobs directly related to activity supported by the Inland Bays and associated payroll. However, it also includes indirect economic effects, consisting of the additional jobs, payroll, and output created when a business directly supported by the Inland Bays purchases goods and services from the many diverse businesses necessary to sustain operations. These businesses include equipment suppliers, construction, transportation, management, food services, and many other types of support businesses. The Inland Bays also result in induced economic effects, which are defined as the additional jobs, payroll, and output created throughout the economy when employees of a direct or indirect employer spend their personal incomes on consumer goods, other property, services, and taxes. Collectively, these factors demonstrate the total economic contributions of the Inland Bays to the region.
> 
> One example of this is a small, fishing charter boat business run out of a marina located on the Inland Bays. This business depends directly on the waters and resources of the Inland Bays to sustain it and provides direct economic impacts by employing staff to operate the fishing vessels and to captain chartered fishing trips.  However, it also results in indirect effects by relying on other local and regional businesses to service the boats, supply oil and fuel, and provide bait and tackle. This business also results in induced economic impacts as its employees spend their earnings to purchase and maintain houses and personal vehicles, buy food and clothing, and pay for entertainment.  These direct, indirect, and induced economic contributions of the Delaware Inland Bays to Sussex County and the rest of Delaware were quantified using the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II), which was developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to estimate the contribution of an industry or industries to a regional economy (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2018). This model has been widely used by government agencies, economic development organizations, regional planners, and businesses. RIMS II requires defining the study region geographically, identifying relevant industries within the study region, querying existing economic data (e.g., publicly available sales or revenue data), and using RIMS II to combine this information to quantify the economic contribution.  Tax revenues were estimated separately. These steps are described in the following sections.
> ---
> 
> Please write this section of the methodology, following the descriptions above, without directly copying them. The description should be focused just on the coastal economy (not the Inland Bays, although the approach is similar), with an illustrative description relevant to coastal activity.
**assistant**:
> Our study of the coastal economy encompasses a broad understanding of economic contributions, including direct, indirect, and induced effects. 
> 
> Direct effects pertain to the jobs, payroll, output, and taxes originating explicitly from coastal activities. Coastal businesses, services, and associated operations form the core of these direct impacts, functioning as the primary contributors to the coastal economy. 
> 
> However, the economic contribution of the coastal region extends beyond these direct effects. The indirect effects capture the economic activity stimulated when coastal businesses procure goods and services from an array of supporting industries. These span across numerous sectors such as equipment suppliers, construction, transportation, management services, and food services. Their economic activity, driven by the needs of the coastal businesses, constitutes an essential part of the indirect effects.
> 
> Induced effects reflect the economic ripple effect resulting from employees of direct or indirect businesses spending their earnings on consumer goods, property, services, and taxes. This downstream spending contributes to job creation, payroll increase, and output expansion, reinforcing the economic cycle.
> 
> To quantify these cascading effects, we employ the concept of a multiplier, which embodies the ratio of total economic impact (direct, indirect, and induced) to the initial direct effect. This multiplier captures the magnifying impact of the initial spending, creating a 'ripple' effect throughout the local economy, with successive rounds of spending and re-spending. It's essential to note that the size of the multiplier can be influenced by factors such as the local workforce's residency, average wages paid, and the proportion of intermediate purchases supplied locally.
> 
> To illustrate, let's consider a seafood processing plant located in a coastal region. The plant's operations, including hiring local workers and buying raw materials, provide direct economic impact. The plant's procurement of goods and services from local suppliers – perhaps packaging materials or maintenance services – constitutes the indirect effect. Finally, when the plant's employees spend their earnings on local goods and services, from grocery shopping to local entertainment, this consumer spending creates induced effects. 
> 
> Thus, the multi-layered economic contributions of the coastal economy can be appreciated. The direct, indirect, and induced impacts weave together to form a comprehensive economic landscape, each enhancing the coastal region's value and its relevance to Delaware's economy as a whole. This approach enables us to gauge the broad economic footprint of coast-related activities, crucial for informed decision-making and strategic planning.
> 
**user**:
> Another section of the methodology should describe modeling and data. Here is how it is reported in the 2012 report:
> ---
> ## Identification of an Appropriate Analytical Model for Calculating the Impacts of Coast-Related Activities
> 
> The analytical model used for calculating the impacts of coastal economic activities in this report was developed by the Minnesota IMPLAN Group. Their IMPLAN (IMpact analysis for PLANning) software is a well-recognized, standard tool for modeling impacts in regional economies. The IMPLAN modeling system is based on official U.S. government data sources for production, employment, wages, incomes, and taxes for more than 400 detailed industry classifications as specified by federal statistical agencies such as the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.
> 
> IMPLAN permits us to keep track of the number of incremental full-time-equivalent employees employed by all of the firms that have direct, indirect, and induced effects. We also keep track of all the incremental “labor income” paid to all the employees as well as all of the taxes and fees paid to state, local, and federal government entities.
> ---
> 
> And here is the equivalent section in the Inland Bays report:
> ---
> ## Existing Economic Data
> 
> Economic data for most industries, represented by sales or revenue, are publicly available through the U.S. Census Bureau’s Economic Census (2021), which was most recently completed in 2017. Data from 2017 were adjusted to 2020 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is published by the U.S.  Bureau of Labor Statistics.
> 
> Since economic data were only available at the county level, a portion of sales and revenue data for Sussex County were allocated to the Inland Bays study region based on the proportion of each industry’s establishments that were located within the study region2. For example, Sussex County sales from hotels and other lodging totaled $127 million, and 60 of 77 establishments (78%) were located in the Inland Bays study region. Therefore, 78% of $127 million, or $99 million, was attributed to the Inland Bays study region. This assumes that average sales per establishment are the same throughout the county, which is likely a conservative assumption since across industries both demand and price tend to increase as proximity to the water increases.
> 
> ## Regional Input-Output Modeling
> 
> The Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) forecasts the contribution of an industry, or suite of industries, within a given area on a broader region by using “multipliers” provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Multipliers are available at both the county and state levels. These multipliers quantify the direct, indirect, and induced economic contributions of an industry, as well as the number of jobs provided by the industry, based on existing sales or revenue data. Multipliers in RIMS II are based on a detailed set of industry accounts that measure the goods and services produced by each industry and the use of these goods and services by industries and final users (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2018).
> 
> For example, to calculate the economic contribution of boat dealers to Sussex County, publicly available boat dealer sales of $44.9 million in the Inland Bays study region are multiplied by 1.4491, which is the multiplier provided by RIMS II for that industry. This multiplier indicates that every dollar spent in the boat dealer industry generates an additional 45 cents of economic activity throughout the region in indirect and induced contributions. When these factors are combined, they sum to a total of $65.1 million in economic contributions. Boat dealer sales ($44.9 million) are also multiplied by 9.619 to quantify the number of full- and part-time jobs supported by the industry, which equals 432 jobs.
> 
> A similar approach was used to quantify the economic contribution of Inland Bays economic activity to the state (i.e., state multipliers were used to forecast contributions based on existing sales and revenue data).
> ---
> 
> Please write this section of the methodology, following the descriptions above, without directly copying them. The description should refer to:
>  - IMPLAN, since this is the model used.
>  - We need to use “Multiregional Input-Output analysis” (MRIO) to properly calculate the contribution, since this estimates both the within-region and beyond-region flows.
>  - The data comes from 2021 and all values are reported in 2021 dollars.

> # Economic Modeling and Data
> 
> In our study, we adopted the IMPLAN (IMpact analysis for PLANning) software developed by the Minnesota IMPLAN Group to compute the impacts of coastal economic activities. This renowned tool is specifically designed for capturing the intricate dynamics of regional economies. Grounded in authentic U.S. government data sources, IMPLAN aligns with more than 400 detailed industry classifications as defined by established federal statistical bodies like the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.
> 
> One of IMPLAN's key strengths is its ability to diligently account for incremental full-time-equivalent employees across firms resulting from direct, indirect, and induced effects. Furthermore, it tracks all the incremental "labor income" paid to employees along with the taxes and fees paid to government entities at state, local, and federal levels.
> 
> For this study, we utilized a Multiregional Input-Output analysis (MRIO) within the IMPLAN framework. MRIO is a powerful analytical tool that helps in capturing both the within-region and beyond-region flows of economic activity. The relevance of MRIO comes from its capacity to model the inter-regional feedback loops, portraying a more holistic and nuanced picture of the economic contribution of coastal activities.
> 
> Our primary data source for this study was the U.S. Census Bureau’s Economic Census from 2021. This offered a comprehensive view of the economic activities in the region, providing data for most industries in terms of sales or revenue. We adjusted the 2021 data to correspond with 2021 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
> 
> The synthesis of IMPLAN, MRIO, and up-to-date Census data forms the backbone of our methodology. This harmonious integration facilitates an in-depth understanding of the coastal economy, thereby serving as a reliable foundation for our analysis and findings.
**user**:
> In place of the seafood processing plant example above, can you provide an example of tourism producing direct, indirect, and induced impacts, providing detail on how different activities ripple through the economy?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, let's consider the case of a beachfront hotel in a coastal town.
> 
> Direct impacts arise from the operations of the beachfront hotel itself. The hotel provides employment to local residents in a variety of roles such as management, housekeeping, food and beverage services, maintenance, and more. This directly infuses money into the local economy via the wages paid to these employees. Furthermore, it generates revenues from guests who pay for rooms, dining, and other amenities, and pays local taxes contributing to municipal budgets.
> 
> Indirect impacts stem from the hotel's need to source goods and services to support its operation. This includes food and beverage suppliers for the hotel’s restaurants, maintenance services for facility upkeep, local marketing agencies for advertising, and linen services for room cleaning, among others. Each of these supplier businesses also provides local jobs and contributes to the economy, forming an intricate network of interdependent businesses.
> 
> Induced impacts are created when the employees of the hotel and the businesses indirectly supported by the hotel spend their earnings in the local economy. They might spend on housing, groceries, entertainment, clothing, and other goods and services. Each of these purchases supports other local businesses and their employees, further broadening the ripple effect.
> 
> As an example of the multiplier effect, let's say a guest at the hotel spends money on a guided tour of local attractions. This payment directly supports the tour company (direct impact). The tour company, in turn, spends money to maintain its vehicles and pay its staff (indirect impact). Then, an employee of the tour company might spend their paycheck at a local grocery store, which supports jobs and incomes there (induced impact).

> In essence, the original expenditure by the hotel guest triggers a cycle of spending and re-spending in the local economy, amplifying the hotel’s economic impact beyond its immediate operations. The multiplier effect captures this total economic impact, which can be significant, particularly in regions heavily reliant on coastal tourism.

> *Study Area and Industry Definitions*
> - Comprehensive study scope encompassing all industries in coastal zip codes, with a targeted subset of coast-related industries included for inland areas.
> - Subset selection based on the 2012 report's methodology, leveraging Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) lists and the University of Massachusetts' research.
> - Further segmentation achieved through specific industry identification for additional information, aligned with the 2012 report's approach.
> 
> *Measuring the Coastal Contribution*
> - Economic contribution of the coastal regions captured via direct, indirect, and induced effects.
> - Direct effects manifest as jobs, payroll, output, and taxes resulting from coastal businesses.
> - Indirect effects emerge from associated businesses that supply goods and services, while induced effects arise from consumer spending by the employees of direct and indirect employers.
> - The sum total of these impacts, encapsulated in a multiplier effect, provides a comprehensive measure of the coast-related economic activity.
> 
> *Economic Modeling and Data*
> - The Minnesota IMPLAN Group's IMPLAN software used as the analytical model to calculate economic impacts.
> - The IMPLAN model is based on data from over 400 detailed industry classifications sourced from U.S. government agencies.
> - Multiregional Input-Output analysis (MRIO) used to estimate both within-region and beyond-region economic flows.
> - All data used in the study are from 2021, with values reported in 2021 dollars.
