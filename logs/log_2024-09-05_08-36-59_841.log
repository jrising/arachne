**assistant**:
> Sharing an impact report to attract new funders requires a targeted and strategic approach, which includes the following elements:
> 
> 1. **Clear and Compelling Narrative:** Make sure your impact report tells a compelling story of your organization's work and the difference it has made. Utilize data visualization to make your report more engaging and easier to understand. Use the power of storytelling to highlight success stories or case studies that truly demonstrate your impact.
> 
> 2. **Transparency:** Clearly outline where funds have been spent thus far, what goals have been achieved, and what challenges remain. It shows potential funders that you are accountable and can be trusted with their resources.
> 
> 3. **Future Goals:** Outline clearly what further funding could achieve. Give specific forecasts of what impact new funders can expect their contribution to have. This gives a clear direction for your organization's future impact.
> 
> 4. **Tailored Communications:** If possible, tailor your communication to the interests, values, and language of each potential funder. Understand their priorities and frame your impact in terms that resonate with them.
> 
> 5. **Promotion:** Share the report widely through various channels - on your website, in email newsletters, on social media, at events, and via direct outreach to potential funders. Utilize your current contacts and network to help spread the message.
> 
> 6. **Engagement:** Don't make sharing your impact report a one-way communication. Invite feedback, questions, and create avenues for potential new funders to interact with your organization. Perhaps they can attend a webinar, a project visit, a meet-and-greet with beneficiaries, or even participate in a mini-version of your project.
> 
> 7. **Follow-up:** After sharing your report, follow up with key prospective funders to discuss any possible queries they might have and take the conversation forward.
> 
> With this approach, you will not only be able to highlight the effectiveness and value of your work but also engage potential funders in an ongoing dialogue, thereby building trust and mutual understanding that lays the foundation for them to back your organization's endeavors.
