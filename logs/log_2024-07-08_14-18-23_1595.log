**assistant**:
> There are a few reliable sources where you can download a wide range of financial stocks in bulk, such as daily (or higher-resolution) values, without having to request each stock individually:
> 
> 1. **Yahoo Finance API via yFinance**:
>    - The `yfinance` library is popular for accessing Yahoo Finance data in Python. 
>    - You can download data for multiple stocks quite easily. For example:
>      ```python
>      import yfinance as yf
> 
>      tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN"]
>      data = yf.download(tickers, period="max", interval="1d")
>      ```
>    - This will give you a pandas DataFrame with historical data for the specified tickers.
> 
> 2. **Alpha Vantage**:
>    - Alpha Vantage provides free APIs for historical and real-time data of financial markets. You will need to sign up for a free API key.
>    - It offers batch stock quotes which can be fetched programmatically. Note that free tier limits the number of requests per minute.
>    - Example usage:
>      ```python
>      import requests
> 
>      API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
>      tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN"]
>      url = f"https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=BATCH_STOCK_QUOTES&symbols={','.join(tickers)}&apikey={API_KEY}"
>      response = requests.get(url)
>      data = response.json()
>      ```
> 
> 3. **Quandl**:
>    - Quandl offers a premium service for bulk download, but you can also access many datasets for free with an API key.
>    - Example usage for downloading historical data:
>      ```python
>      import quandl
> 
>      API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
>      quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = API_KEY
>      tickers = ["WIKI/AAPL", "WIKI/MSFT", "WIKI/GOOGL", "WIKI/AMZN"]
>      data = quandl.get(tickers, start_date="2020-01-01", end_date="2023-12-31")
>      ```
> 
> 4. **Polygon.io**:
>    - Polygon.io offers real-time and historic financial market data via APIs. The API is not free, but it provides comprehensive bulk data.
>    - Example usage:
>      ```python
>      import requests
> 
>      API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
>      tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN"]
>      url = f"https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/ticker/{tickers}/range/1/day/2020-01-01/2023-12-31?apiKey={API_KEY}"
>      response = requests.get(url)
>      data = response.json()
>      ```
> 
> 5. **Financial Data Providers with Databases**:
>    - Services like Bloomberg, Refinitiv, and Morningstar provide extensive financial data but usually require a subscription. They offer APIs and bulk download options suited for professional use.
> 
> Remember to check the terms of use and the number of requests allowed per minute/hours for these services, and obtain necessary API keys for accessing the data.
