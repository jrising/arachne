> I have a long-running collaboration under the Climate Impact Lab (CIL, \url{https://impactlab.org/}), which is charting one interdisciplinary path to quantify climate risks. My collaboration began before the CIL was established, when I built the analytical engine behind the influential American Climate Prospectus (ACP) \cite{houser2014american, hsiang2017estimating}. As part of CIL, I have developed ground-breaking new approaches for handling heterogeneity in climate vulnerability and the quantification of adaptation costs, building upon a close collaboration between climate scientists, engineers, and environmental economists \cite{rode2021estimating, carleton2022valuing}. I lead the work bringing together climate and
> socioeconomic projections with econometric models to produce
> high-resolution risk estimates for a range of major sectors (health, energy, agriculture
> and labor productivity). This process requires new solutions to a range of problems previously missing from the literature, including how to develop high-resolution disaggregations of future income; how to evaluate climate-driven damages in the face of climate-driven and non-climate-driven adaptation; and how to integrate climatological, socioeconomic, adaptation, and impact uncertainty. I have worked with the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, developing ways to integrate results from CIL into the U.S. Regional Energy Policy (USREP, 2019 -- 2020) and Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA, 2022 -- {\footnotesize {\sc Present}}) models. My work developing the techniques for integrating empirical damages into macroeconomic models has resulted in one publication \cite{piontek2021integrated}, and contributions to workshops initiated by the National Academy of Sciences and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
> 
> Rapid progress on climate impacts requires new tools-- like my CIL projection system-- which help researchers with the necessary sophisticated analysis. The ACP relied on an innovative online tool I developed for performing econometric meta-analyses (\url{http://dmas.berkeley.edu/}), designed to allow any researcher to expand the database of economic risks.  Drawing from my experience with the CIL's climate risk evaluation and my engagement with the community for detailed-processing modeling \cite{ciscar2019assessing}, I have developed a method to estimate damages across multiple risks that enables rapid, decentralized expansion of the collection of risks \cite{rising2022missing}.
> I have translated these solutions into public tools and materials to facilitate climate impact projections more widely, including a tutorial under review at the Journal of Open Source Education (\url{https://climateestimate.net/}).
> 
> As a demonstration of these methods and a case study for their further development, I have produced the first plausibly-comprehensive estimate of the costs of climate change, by combining a large collections of risk models and an estimate of missing risks for the United Kingdom. This work was released as a public report, emphasizing comprehensiveness, spatial inequality, and risk \cite{rising2022will} (funded by the European Climate Foundation). I am now preparing an extension of this work for academic publication, incorporating expert elicitation, econometric estimates, process-based models, and spill-over effects. The approach also provides a template for performing high-quality climate risk assessments in other countries, for which I am pursuing funding.

The paper then produces new estimates of the potential for crop movement to alleviate climate impacts, using the water-energy-food optimization framework described below. In another paper, I bring together multiple methods (econometrics, machine learning, and epidemiological modeling) to resolve crucial questions regarding the effect of weather variation on COVID-19 spread\cite{rising2023weather}. As with my work on coffee, the structural modeling here reveals a hidden impact of weather, in this case on disease detection.

> As part of my interest in human-environment interactions, I study how theoretical issues from complexity science make a real, empirical
> difference for social and environmental policy. Most of my research under this agenda focuses on the role of interactions across space (cross-boundary flows \cite{ramesh2019small}, climate inequality \cite{carleton2022valuing}, neighbor-dependence \cite{taylor2021tipping}), but has also touched on issues like cross-scale

> A special interest of mine is examining how spatial features of food production give rise to concealed risks and opportunities, such as my work on crop movement in the US described before \cite{rising2020crop}.

With a new comprehensive description of inter-basin transfers \cite{siddik2023interbasin} (funded by USGS) and state-level water use dataset \cite{josset2019us}, this model has the potential to change our understanding of resource conflicts and environmental footprints and to improved management strategies across the United States \cite{brelsford2020developing}.

I am the lead developer for the PAGE model, after co-leading the translation of the model into an open-source framework, in accordance with my work to rapidly expand the capacity of researchers to perform climate risk analysis \cite{moore2018mimi}. Through a paper led by my Masters students, PAGE now has,

> Climate impacts on food security may be the most wide-spread, unpredictable of all climate risks, with consequences across the developing world that could drive cascading disruptions. My existing research provides a strong foundation for tackling some of the hardest challenges in food. I have nascent projects to study the feedbacks between water, land use, and agriculture; the risks to small-holder farmers as crop suitability shifts; the potential for marine conservation to support fisheries production; and the potential for food production disruptions (crop failure, stock collapse) to drive displacement and conflict.

> My goal for the future is to unify these projects to create a holistic understanding of food systems, globally and over the next century. The foundation of this work will be an innovative integration of annual and perennial crop biophysical models with empirical approaches. This integration capitalizes on the strengths of both approaches, accounting for non-linearity and adaptation options within the biophysical models while better accounting for the observed heterogeneities underlying historical productivity.  These models would then inform a study of spatial shifts, which-- in the same spirit of combining methods-- would integrate spatial optimization with statistically-grounded movement and friction models \cite{hultgren2022estimating}. This work, outlined in a proposed CAREER grant, also supports the development of spin-off interactive tools that can facilitate better learning and stakeholder/policy-maker engagement.
> 
> Finally, I am motivated to close the knowledge gaps between biodiversity loss, climate change, and livelihoods. Food production drives a large share of the disruption of ecosystems, but understanding how this effect will evolve in the future requires a better economic understanding of the behaviors that emerge from the distress and opportunities farmers and fishers face. While the fate of natural systems is largely unmonetized, the loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity is likely to undermine food security and human welfare. An initial project to synthesize these issues is under a pending grant proposal with the Belmont Forum.

> My research program focuses on interdisciplinary studies addressing climate impacts, land use, fisheries, health, transportation, tipping points, and environmental equity. By employing quantitative techniques from various fields such as econometrics, Bayesian simulations, machine learning, spatial optimization, and detailed process modeling, I strive to develop systems perspectives. This methodological flexibility empowers me to contribute as a researcher and an educator with a wide-ranging global network.

> My research delves into better management of complex, social-environmental systems under global environmental change. A key goal is to enhance our understanding of appropriate actions amidst environmental uncertainty. I achieve this by synthesizing models and approaches across multiple disciplines, with a particular emphasis on climate change's effects on food production and vulnerable communities. I aim to facilitate the development of detailed transition pathways that ensure both economic and environmental sustainability.

> One integral aspect of my research involves bridging gaps between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics. By consolidating perspectives from these disciplines, I work towards interdisciplinary consensus-building for enhancing our understanding of climate risks. My contributions through grant-funded workshops and publications have charted a way forward in this regard. For instance, I have collaborated with the Climate Impact Lab, where I developed ground-breaking approaches to quantify climate risks and adaptation costs based on interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists, engineers, and environmental economists.

I have also produced the first comprehensive estimate of the costs of climate change, providing insights into spatial inequality and risk. I am currently extending this work to include expert elicitation, econometric estimates, process-based models, and spill-over effects.
