**user**:
> Is there a difference between saying a dataset is "spatial" vs. "geospatial"?
**assistant**:
> The terms "spatial" and "geospatial" are often used interchangeably in the context of data, but there can be subtle variations in meaning.
> 
> Both types of data include information about location, but the nature of the location information can differ.
> 
> **Spatial data** is a broader term that refers to any data that is defined in space or has a relationship to space. This could be in a two-dimensional sense (like on a traditional map), but it also applies to three-dimension or even non-geographic spaces. For example, spatial data could refer to locations within a warehouse or distances between galaxies. It relates to both geometric (shapes, points, lines) and geographic data. 
> 
> **Geospatial data**, on the other hand, refers specifically to data that is related to locations on the Earth's surface. It is grounded in real-world physical locations and encompasses latitude-longitude coordinates, elevation measurements, or any other data tied to a geographic or mapped location. Geospatial data includes both absolute and relative location data and can include time specifications.
> 
> So, while all geospatial data is spatial data, not all spatial data is geospatial. That being said, the terms really reflect a slight nuance in emphasis, and you'll still encounter them being used interchangeably in many contexts.
