> Oceans play a crucial role in sustaining biodiversity (Duarte et al., 2020), regulating the earth’s climate, providing food security, supporting livelihoods, and grounding foundation for a multitude of economic activities (Whitmee et al., 2015). The vast array of resources and services derived from marine and coastal environments contribute significantly to the global economy, projected to double between 2010 and 2030 to US$3 trillion as ocean-based industries continue to expand (The Ocean Economy in 2030 | En | OECD, n.d.). However, the growing economic resilience on coastal ocean spaces has resulted in increased exploitation of marine resources and a surge in industries such as renewable energy, shipping, fisheries, and tourism (Bennett et al., 2019; Jouffray et al., 2020). 
> While ocean-based industries have undoubtedly contributed to the economic growth, they have also triggered significant environmental degradation. Human activities such as overfishing, habitat destruction, marine pollution, and unregulated coastal development have hurt biodiversity, weakened marine ecosystem, and contributing to the climate change ((Dulvy et al., 2003; Lotze et al., 2006; Pandolfi et al., 2003; Worm et al., 2005; Halpern et al., 2008; Human Health and Ocean Pollution - Annals of Global Health, n.d.). For example, oceanic biotic exploitation is reducing the abundance of many aquatic species and harming the health and adaptability of entire marine ecosystems (Ortuño Crespo & Dunn, 2017); marine fish stocks and ecosystems are declining in many parts of our ocean as a result of global overfishing (Sumaila & Tai, 2020); increased marine tourism is driving negative impacts on coastal and marine environments, with additional consequences for  tourism-dependent communities (Tourism Is Damaging the Ocean. Here’s What We Can Do to Protect It, 2019). The cumulative effects of these pressures threaten the long-term health of oceans and their capacity to provide ecosystem service essential for human well-being (Lotze et al., 2006; Pandolfi et al., 2003). Furthermore, oceans play a critical role in mitigating climate change by absorbing a large proportion of the earth’s carbon dioxide and excess heat (Gattuso et al., 2015), underscoring the need for sustainable management of marine resources.
> To address the growing conflicts between economic development and environmental sustainability, Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has emerged as a key tool for ecosystem-based management of the multiple use of marine spaces (Crowder & Norse, 2008; Ehler & Douvere, 2009; Reimer et al., 2023). MSP can regulate existing and potential ocean uses for fisheries, tourism and other frequent activities, can reduce conflicts between activities and can support the introduction of better management strategies (Iglesias-Campos et al., 2021) to achieve ecological, economic, and social objectives in marine spaces. (Ehler & Douvere, 2009).
> Stamoulis & Delevaux, 2015 asserts that effective MSP relies heavily on the availability and abundance of data. For a sustainable and effective MSP process, there is a wide need for different kinds of data: regulatory and management data like jurisdictional boundaries and policies, biophysical data like marine habitats, species and physical oceanography (Ehler & Douvere, 2009), socio-economic data like fisheries, shipping, navigation, tourism and recreation (Crowder & Norse, 2008), cultural and heritage data (Gilliland & Laffoley, 2008), geospatial data like bathymetry and marine cadastre (Bartlett, 2007), environmental impact data like pollution sources and climate change impact (Douvere, 2008), marine resource data like mineral, energy resources and aquaculture (Frazão Santos et al., 2015),  risk and vulnerability data like natural hazards and vulnerability assessment (Halpern et al., 2008), ecological data on larval dispersal routes and migration pathways (Foley et al., 2010), ecosystem service data like water purification and coastal protection, recreational value (Liquete et al., 2013) and monitoring and evaluation data (Day, 2008). However, data gaps have hindered MSP’s capacity to fully integrate ecological, economic, and social dimensions (Halpern et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2013). These data gaps include inadequate information (Thurstan et al., 2015), limited spatial resolution (often greater than 10 km, making it difficult to assess fine-scale ecological processes or site specific human activities) (Halpern et al., 2008), temporal gaps (Douvere, 2008), fragmented data sources (Flynn et al., 2021), a shortage of real-time information (Douvere, 2008), all of which critically affect the efficacy of the MSP. For instance, biological data gaps such as inadequate information on species population dynamics, critical habitats, and migration routes create uncertainty when determining conservation priorities and mitigating the impact of industrial activities (Thurstan et al., 2015). Similarly, socio-economic data gaps concerning the valuation of ecosystem services, the economic contribution of marine industries, and community reliance on marine resources often result in an incomplete understanding of the economic trade-off involved in MSP (Stithou, 2017). Supporting this, Flannery et al., 2016; St. Martin & Hall-Arber, 2008 highlights that inadequate attention to the collection and incorporation of social and ecological data has led to criticism for several MSP processes, with some even being considered incomplete (Fock, 2008). This data gap can lead to an incomplete representation of crucial marine activities and areas, negatively impacting the planning process (Thoya et al., 2021). Analyzing existing data sources to identify any gaps and gathering stakeholder perspectives through interviews are considered two of the key steps in MSP (Shucksmith et al., 2014; Thoya et al., 2021).
> To understand the extent and importance of data gaps, a comprehensive catalog of spatially-distinguished activities needs to be developed. We do this for Delaware. Multiple forms of data gaps are relevant to the MSP process. We construct a categorization scheme that (1) highlights the need for both human and resource information and (2) recognizes that some forms of data importantly build upon others. We wanted to understand the process of how people classify the activities which are important for their different uses of the ocean.

> 
> Methods
> In our study we consider resources, habitats, activities, and constraints that occur within Delaware Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Control’s (DNREC) Planning Area, shown in Figure 1, as well as activities in Delaware closely associated with the marine waters. The eastern edge of the planning area is set at 72° 24" W, covering the marine caverns offshore Delaware. 
> 
> 
> We define an “activity” as a way that a spatial segment of the ocean or bay is used, managed, or interacted with. This includes everything from shipping, where the ocean acts as little more than a roadway, to the presence of artificial reefs, encompassing both their construction and the consequences they have on the local ecosystem. We also include activities which could be supported by future marine spatial planning, even if they do not currently occur in Delaware waters.
> 
> To identify relevant activities related to the bay and ocean in Delaware, we used a systematic and comprehensive approach. To begin, we looked at publicly available datasets such as the Marine Cadastre, the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal (MARCO), ship use designations from Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracks in 2022, and various tourism data sources to get a baseline understanding of marine and coastal usage. Second, we drew upon economic classifications of marine-related industry, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) categories in "Exhibit 2. Ocean Economy Sectors and Industries by SIC and NAICS Codes," and the University of Massachusetts President's Office report titled An Assessment of the Coastal and Marine Economies of Massachusetts, dated June 29, 2006. Third, we conducted an extensive review of academic literature, reviewing papers on Marine Spatial Planning in the mid-Atlantic region. Finally, we drew upon notes from stakeholders meetings conducted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). These meetings gave us direct insights and helped us identify additional activities not covered in the literature review.
> 
> We also performed a survey of individual and organizational use of the Delaware Bay and ocean and associated data needs. This survey was sent to respondents in academic, business, federal and local government, and NGOs. Responses representing a wide range of interests: recreation and tourism, commercial fishing, port and harbor operations, research and environmental studies, and educational programs. The respondents also identified different regions of particular interest, including coasts, tidal marshes, near shore waters, and deeper federal waters.
> 
> For each marine activity identified, we evaluated the presence of six categories of data as follows. i) Physical data, covering features of the natural environment and the physical prerequisites for the activity. This includes physical properties of the ocean, such as bathymetry, ocean chemistry, and marine climatology, and the biological conditions that create suitable habitats, such as substrate, climatological suitability, and spawning grounds. However, the resources themselves which are exploited or modified by the activity are not part of this category; ii) Resource data, describing the material that the activity utilizes, extracts, or modifies. It ranges from observed abundance of fish and sand resources to wind speeds at the turbine level; iii) Usage data, including how the resources and physical environment are utilized. It covers the extent of the exploitation, such as catch data for fish, or visitation, such as tourists trips. iv) Management data, covering how the usage of the resource is managed. It can involve regional zone designations, and spatial or quantitative data related to regulatory policies and management bodies; v) Economic data, covering the financial and economic outcomes of the usage of the resource under current management. It includes revenue, cost, employment numbers, and data on outputs produced; and vi) Future/Proposed data,  including projected changes to the physical environment, resources, or uses; as well as proposed changes in management or infrastructure.  Datasets were identified across government providers, NGOs, central data repositories, and academic articles.  Datasets are also flagged as being legacy data (greater than 10 years old) or low-resolution (greater than 10 km resolution). In some cases, the same datasets are relevant to a wide range of activities. For this, we have identified “Dataset Collections”, such as seven bathymetry datasets, which are then referenced as relevant datasets under the relevant activities.  Figure 2: Summary of data-gaps analysis approach. (a) “Specific activities” that are broadly related are combined into “activity groups” for the purpose of reporting. Each specific activity is linked to all relevant datasets, according to one or more “dataset relevance” categories. (b) The spatial scale, temporal range, and update frequency of datasets is identified to quantify the quality of data over time. This is shown here for all datasets, by relevance category, and split by activity group in the results below. (c) The number of activities linked with each dataset, colored by that dataset’s relevance.
> Results
> The table below provides a summary of the number of datasets identified across each of the studied activities, for each category of data relevance. In the table, physical, resource, and usage data is split between a count of all datasets (“All”) and high-quality data sets (“H.Q.”). High quality datasets are those that are more recent than 10 years old and have spatial resolutions greater than a 10 km grid. Across all combinations of activities and data categories, there are 460 connections. However, this number double counts datasets that inform multiple activities or data categories. This report is based on the recording of 299 datasets, of which 113 were evaluated beyond just their association with activities and data categories (the remaining come from the MARCO Data Catalog or Earth Engine Catalog). Each activity will also show some spatial and temporal information about its available datasets, in a Available Data Figure. Only datasets where temporal and spatial information has been recorded will show up in these figures.

> This section explores the state’s efforts in Coastal Conservation, Marine Conservation, and Salt Marsh Protection. Through initiatives such as beach nourishment, artificial reef construction, and the safeguarding of salt marshes, Delaware aims to protect its coastline, enhance biodiversity, and ensure the long-term sustainability of its cherished marine and coastal ecosystems. Respondents to the survey identified data gaps in information on wetland health, sea level rise, salinity, and climate change-induced shifts in marine species populations. They also emphasized the importance of directly notifying conservation organizations about impactful projects. There were significant data gaps in the use of conservation areas for activities such as visitation and sightseeing. Furthermore, resource data for coastal and salt marsh conservation, particularly species distributions and habitats, are lacking. Delaware coastal conservation includes beach nourishment (also included under tourism activities) and dune preservation to combat erosion, with beach nourishment projects sourced from both onshore and offshore sand supplies. Figure 3 (Top Panel) shows the different conservation efforts in Delaware including coral protection zones and marine protected areas. Data challenges in the Mid-Atlantic region include a scarcity of information on shoreline type and coastal structures. Delaware's marine conservation efforts include artificial reefs made from repurposed materials and NOAA Fisheries Service-designated Special Management Zone Areas to protect critical marine habitats. Salt marsh protection focuses on safeguarding biodiversity, improving water quality, enhancing sediment stability, and increasing resilience against climate impacts. 
> Biodiversity of Marine Species 
> 
> Marine species data for Delaware's ocean and bay planning reveal significant gaps, particularly in high-definition aerial imagery, eDNA data, wind turbine interactions, radar/lidar studies for birds, and ROV video data for sea turtles. Despite available data from various species groups, there is an urgent need for spatially and temporally robust biological data, including species population and distribution information, to assess the effects of shipping activity and climate change. Figure 03 (Bottom Panel)  illustrates shows highly migratory fish species’ habitats for some key marine species. Specific gaps include radar/lidar studies and seabird diet information for birds, high-definition aerial imagery and eDNA data repositories for marine mammals, and centralized data repositories and high-resolution distribution data for bats and sea turtles. Protected bird species under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) include Audubon’s Shearwater, Common Loon, Double-Crested Cormorant, Great Black-Backed Gull, and Great Shearwater. Marine mammals in North Atlantic Right Whale Seasonal Management Areas and other cetacean migration and habitat zones should get priority for gathering monitoring data, but other species like bats and sea turtles also face significant data gaps. 
>  
> Figure 4: Temporal and Spatial Data Gaps in subgroup: Conservation & Biodiversity. 
> Figure 4 shows that, in term of coverage, Physical and Resource Data are fairly covered from 1980s onward, with only a few high-resolutaiion datasets, most of the data is at coarse resolutions, like 25 km or state level. Management Data has similar kind of spatial properties with the most available data from late 1980 to early 2000s. Economic Data is very limited, with its coarse spatial level. In contrast, Usage and Future/Proposed Data show a complete lack of datasets, which creates a significant data gap in this classe of activities. 
> Commercial Fishing & Aquaculture

> 
> Commercial Fishing
> Between 2011 and 2020, commercial fishing in Delaware averaged 4.9 million pounds annually, generating $9.1 million. Shellfish, especially blue crabs, were the largest contributors, averaging 3.5 million pounds and $6.5 million. Figure 5 (Top Panel) illustrates the spatial distribution of scallop and hydraulic dredge fishing areas, with a very few overlaps with the most significant catches occurring in offshore waters, where scallop yields are highest (up to 2052 pounds) and hydraulic clam dredging zones are concentrated closer to the coast. 
> 
> A major challenge in fisheries management is the lack of comprehensive data. Significant gaps exist in the collection and use of Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Vessel Trip Report (VTR) data across the Mid-Atlantic, including Delaware. VMS data varies by region and often lacks recreational fishing and economic details. VTR data can be outdated and incomplete, especially for recreational fishing. These data deficiencies impact benthic and pelagic gear fishing, affecting species like striped bass, blue crabs, and various tuna species.
> Aquaculture
> Aquaculture does not currently operate in the marine planning area, but nearby regions, such as New Jersey’s side of Delaware Bay, have established aquaculture sectors. These operations involve a variety of aquatic organisms, including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic plants. In the Inland Bay region, the Shellfish Aquaculture Development Areas (SADA)  are specifically designated for their streamlined permitting processes for future aquaculture expansion. In figure 5 (Bottom Panel) , the location of aquaculture and designated Shellfish Aquaculture Development Areas is concentrated primarily in the Inland Bay, with a notable presence of aquaculture farming in the New Jersey region. 
> 
> The Dewberry Engineers (2018) report highlights key issues and data needs for offshore aquaculture siting, such as identifying suitable areas and species, minimizing impacts, and understanding ocean health and water quality. Essential data include marine species abundance and distribution, water quality (e.g., debris, oil spills, harmful algal blooms), spatial data on jurisdictions and regulated areas, bathymetry, and human activities like commercial fishing and vessel traffic. Economic data on the number of people involved and the benefits they derive from aquaculture are notably lacking. 
>  
>  
> Figure 6: Temporal and Spatial Data Gaps in Commercial Fishing & Aquaculture Activities
> 
> Figure 6 shows that, Physical Data has the most complete data, covering the most temporal span, having the coarse spatial resolution of 25 km, whereas Resource Data has the temporal coverage from 1990 to 2010 and has the same spatial resolution. Usage Data shows intermittent availability, but it’s mostly concentrated at broader scales, and data significantly drops off in recent years. Management Data is extremely limited, with only a few datasets available in the most recent years, also at very coarse resolutions. Economic Data, on the other hand, has some consistent coverage, but it lacks fine spatial details and is missing recent data as well. Finally, Future/ Proposed category is complety absent, showing a critical data gap in this class of activities.

> 
> The Delaware/Maryland coast is rich in maritime history, as evidenced by shipwrecks such as the De Braak and the Misty Blue, which provide insight into the region's past. Both Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021) emphasize the importance of updated data on cultural heritage sites, including underwater archaeological resources, which necessitates better information from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Park Service. Delaware's Native American history is well-documented, with over 4 million artifacts tracing the cultural evolution from the Late Ice Age to European contact. However, significant data gaps exist in documenting and updating cultural heritage and tribal activities, necessitating improved metadata and publicly available information to preserve Delaware's rich heritage.

> The future of recreation in Delaware faces significant challenges due to data gaps in understanding recreational patterns, locating artificial reef sites, and reducing conflicts between recreational and commercial activities. Recreation includes beach-based tourism (activities around the shore such as beach going, beach combing, hiking, and sight-seeing), recreational fishing, and water-based tourism (activities such as swimming, diving, and boating). Figure 7 highlight the spatial distribution and frequency of various recreational activities. Most of these activities concentrated along the shore, implying a more frequent beach-based tourism while underwater and surface water activities are more dispersed across the coastal waters. Figure 8 ( a & b ) show different recreational activities, while 8 (a) focuses on scenic viewing activities, highlighting regions with varying frequencies, ranging from low (1-2 occurrences) to high (up to 112 occurrences), with the green areas showing the spatial extent of the activities. Figure 8 (b) illustrates shore-based activities such as beachgoing, biking, hiking, and camping, with the highest concentration of shore use (up to 78 occurrences) marked in red. Shore use is more intense along certain sections of the coastline, particularly in areas easily accessible for recreational activities.
> 
> 
> Figure 9: Temporal and Spatial Data Gaps in Cultural Activities & Recreation
> Critical data on vessel traffic, human and cultural use areas, and water quality are missing, hindering effective planning. Detailed vessel traffic data from Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) provide information that can be used to minimize conflicts between activities like fishing, tour boating, and charter fishing. Comprehensive information on marine debris, harmful algal blooms, oil spills, and the impact of climate change on species distribution is crucial. These deficiencies impede effective planning for recreational activities and beach-based tourism (Dewbery Engineers 2018). Figure 9 highlights that, Physical Data has the consistent collection from 1980s until around 2000s, with a low resolution. Resource Data follows a similar pattern, but with a finer spatial resolution around 1 km. Though there are missing datasets until 2010, Usage Data looks consistent over time but with a coarse spatial scale. Management Data has a substantial amount of data available between the 1980s and 2010, but it drops off significantly afterward, with most of the data being at coarser resolutions. There are very little datasets for Economic Data and a complete lack of datasets for Future/Proposed Data category.

> 
> The exploration, development, and utilization of energy sources and mineral resources in the Delaware ocean and bay area includes offshore wind energy, other energy sources, and mineral extraction, all of which have significant data gaps. Offshore wind farming, which entails building large wind turbines at sea to harness consistent wind speeds for electricity, necessitates extensive data collection on marine species, vessel traffic, and human use areas. Figure 9 highlights the wind energy potential in the region; these are area with the is highest wind energy density, particularly off the Delaware coast, with estimates ranging from 4 to 5.5 MW/km². The spatial distribution shows that the highest wind energy values are concentrated further offshore. 
> Other energy sources, such as offshore oil and gas reserves and wave energy, have potential but are difficult to develop due to a lack of data. Sand and mineral extraction is critical for coastal replenishment, but it is hampered by sediment information gaps, which have an impact on fisheries management, shoreline erosion, and coastal development. Both Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021) emphasize that existing data on sand and borrow sites is incomplete and insufficient for practical use, with historical data frequently unavailable in digital formats. The upcoming Marine Minerals Information System from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management aims to address these deficiencies, with the promise of improving spatial planning and sustainable development in Delaware. Figure 10 shows the location of surveyed sand resources in the region, identifying areas with proven, potential, and unverified sand deposits, which are vital for coastal restoration projects.
> Infrastructure
> The Mid-Atlantic region has significant data gaps regarding the location of onshore and offshore facilities, permit management, and the siting of energy and telecommunications infrastructure. Jurisdictions, the distribution of marine species, human use areas, bathymetry, and existing pipelines and cables are all examples of critical missing information. The lack of data impedes effective decision-making and future infrastructure planning (Dewberry Engineers 2018).
> Water Intake, Discharge, Waste
> Cooling water intake and discharge in Delaware entail extracting water to cool industrial machinery and returning heated water under strict regulations designed to protect marine ecosystems. Waste and wastewater management entails reducing environmental impact through proper disposal and treatment. Identifying disposal sites, understanding regulated areas, tracking commercial fishing, and collecting bathymetric and species habitat data are all critical planning data requirements. However, significant data gaps exist in these areas, preventing effective environmental conservation and planning (Dewberry Engineers 2018).

> 
> Figure 11: Active and former military operating areas.	Figure 12: Dangerous areas and restricted zones in the planning area.
> Military
> The military section of the Delaware Ocean and Bay Planning Area includes current defense exercises as well as historical munitions deposition. Military operations take place within VACAPES and the Atlantic City OPAREAs, with a focus on public safety and marine wildlife protection. Former Defense Sites are areas containing munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) from previous military activities, with efforts to manage, locate, and mitigate hazards. "Figure 11 maps the active and former military operating areas, highlighting the Military Operating Area and Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS). The spatial extent shows that the majority of these areas are concentrated offshore, with some extending close to the coastline, indicating potential overlap with some beach and water-based activities. Figure 12 further maps dangerous and restricted zones where access is limited due to potential military hazards. Despite identifying relevant categories, there are significant data gaps in mapping and monitoring these MECs, which impedes effective hazard management and planning.
> Science & Technology
> Scientific observation in Delaware’s marine waters is critical to understanding and managing marine resources, mitigating human impacts, and ensuring sustainability. Survey respondents emphasized the importance of improved sediment data and real-time monitoring. Despite the importance of science and technology, there are significant data gaps in terms of research activity, relevant institutions, and funding. 
> Navigation & Transport

> 
> Navigation & Navigation Services
> Navigation and navigation services in Delaware include several critical components. Navigation entails managing marine activities, such as anchorage areas where ships can safely anchor while minimizing interference with navigable waterways. Figure 12 shows where ships and boats were most active in 2022 across the Delaware ocean and bay area. It highlights important maritime routes like marine highways, navigation channels, and regulated zones. The red areas point out the busiest spots for ship traffic, especially around the main shipping lanes near the entrance to Delaware Bay. There's also a noticeable concentration of activity around Cape Henlopen and along the key navigation channels. 
> Lightering, or the transfer of cargo between vessels, ensures efficient logistics despite port size limitations. Navigation services, such as employing maritime pilots and maintaining tow boats, help to ensure safe maritime traffic. Ports are vital hubs that require ongoing maintenance and strategic planning to meet current and future demands. The ship and boat building industry promotes maritime activities through design, construction, and repair. 
> 
> However, there are significant data gaps in these areas that impede efficient management and future planning, such as the need for comprehensive data on observed activities, sediment data, real-time monitoring, and economic data related to research activities. Figure 13 maps cargo ship activity which categorizes ships based on their cargo type, including those carrying hazardous materials, and indicates whether they are just passing through or docking. 
> Transport
> Transportation in Delaware's ocean and bay uses a variety of modes, including deep-sea freight and tankers, which support international trade by transporting heavyweight cargo around the world, as well as ferries, which facilitate regional travel. Despite the sector's importance, there is an unexpected scarcity of detailed data to support effective management and planning.
