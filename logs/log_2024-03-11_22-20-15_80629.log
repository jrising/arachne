> The social cost of carbon is the benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions

> The marginal impact of greenhouse gas emissions is the damage done by emitting an additional
> tonne of, say, carbon dioxide. It is known as the marginal damage cost, and as the social
> cost of carbon. It is the change in the net present value of the monetized impacts due to a
> small cha.nge in emissions, normalized by those emissions. Because of symmetry, the marginal

> emissions.
> The social cost of carbon is an estimate of the desirable intensity of climate

> lf the emissions trajectory is optimal, then the social cost of carbon equals the Pigou tax:
> The price we should put on greenhouse gas emissions if we wish to optimize net present welfare.
> Estimates of the social cost of carbon thus tell us what to do, how intensive climate policy
> should be, how much energy rises should be raised. It is a normative concept.
> The social cost of carbon depends on many things, so there are many,
> widely different estimates.
> There have been many estimates of the marginal damage co 't of carbon dioxide, the latest

> of its first partial derivative? The answer is that there are 69 comparative-static estimates of the
> total impact of climate change on the current economy and for a particular scenario. The static
> results in Figure 6.2 need to be turned into dynamic ones by ru;surning a particular scenario
> for emissions and climate change, by ass11ming a scenario for development and the evolution
> of adaptive capacity, aud by assuming functional forms of the relationship between impacts
> on the one hand and climate and development on the other. Furthermore. impacts need to be

> tax equal to the marginal damage cost estimate. If Lhe carbon tax equals the marginal damage
> co t, it is known as the Pigou tax (sec Section 4.1). If a carbon tax is imposed, emissions fall
> and climate change is less of a problem. Therefore, the Pigou tax is less than the social cost of
> carbon: 8154/tC versus $195/tC. Figme 6.9 and Table 6.1 also show that a carbon tax sha11)ly
> reduces the uncertainty about the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions.
> 6.6 The growth rate of the social cost of carbon***
> The social cost of carbon should rise by some 2% per year.
> There are a number of studies of the evolution over time of the marginal damage costs of
> greenhouse gas emissions. The mean growth rate of the marginal damage cost is 2.2% per year,
> with a standard deviation of 1.0%. If we take all studies that use a no-policy scenario, the mean
> growth rate of the social cost of carbon is 2.3% with a standard deviation of 1.0%. If we take
> all studies that use ru1 optimal scenario, the mean growth rate of the Pigou tax is 2.1% with a
> standard deviation of 1.0%.
> The difference in growth between the social cost of carbon and the Pigou ta.x is because
> climate policy affects climate change in the long run, but not in the short run. The Pigou tax
> i therefore not only lower than the social cost of carbon {cf. Figure 6.9), it also rises more
> slowly.
> There is a sharp contrast between dynamic efficiency and dynamic cost-efficacy. In the
> laUcr case, the price of carbon should rise at a rate that is about 0.6% higher than Lhe rat..c of
> discount (see Section 4.6). In the former case, the price of carbon should rise at some 2.2% per
> year.
> 4The marginal damage cost is the net present value of marginal damages in the future. The marginal damage
> is thus a summation of a series, and you would want it to converge, that is. its value should not change if you
> add an extra year at the end. lf you use the low utility discount rate of 0.1 % per year advocated by Lord Stern
> of Brentford, welfare impacts 12,000 years from today may still affect the net present value. Forecasting that far

> 9.2 The Ramsey rule**
> Climate change is a long-term problem. If you do not care about the distant future, then
> climate change is of little concern. This is clear from Section 6.5. Table 6.1 shows that the
> social cost of carbon is higher if the discount rate is lower. If the discount rate is higher, you
> care less about the future. If you care less about the future, you care less about climate change.
> rr you care less about climate change, you would impose a lower carbon ta.x.
> The Ramsey rule has these three components: Pure time preference and
> consumption growth transformed to utility growth.
> The Ramsey rule says that the consumption rate of discow1t r consists of three components:
> r = p+'T]g (9.1)
> First, we discount the future because we expect to be richer (g). Indeed, it would not make sense
> to transfor money from your relatively poor current self to a relatively rich future self. The faster
> the expected growth, the higher the discount rate. Second, the evaluation of '·relatively poor"
> versus ·'relatively rich·· depends on the cmvature of the utility function, commonly referred to
> as the rate of relative risk aversion (1'/)-Together 'I and g constitute the growth rate of utility,
> the rate at which we grow happier. This part of the Ramsey rule is largely uncontroversial. 1
> We discount the future because we are impatient and because we expect
> to become richer and happier.
> The third part is controversial. People discount the future for the sake or it being the future.
> This is captured by the pure rate of time preference (p).2 also referred to as the utility rate
> of discount. Philosophers and religious leaders have long maintained that we should not treat
> the future differently than the present, that is, p = 0. Yet people do. All empirical evidence
> suggests that people are impatient. The observed consumption discount rate typically exceeds
> the growth rate of conswnption, corrected for the rate of risk aversion.
> 1Tberc is the slight matter of the measurement of oousumption growth. ln theory, this is the growth rate
> of all the things we care about. In practice, it is the growth rate of material consumption as captured by the
> national accounts. The rate of relative risk aversion is hard to measure too.
> 21t is, in fact, the rate of pure time preference, but no one calls it that.
> The Ramsey rule describes the discount rate of consumers. In equilibrium it
> equals the interest rate paid on the capital market.
> The Ramsey rule describes the consumption rate of discount from an individual perspective.
> If the economy is in a dynamic equilibrium, the consumption rate of discount equals the interest
> rate, the price of money on the capital market. If the interest rate were higher than the
> consumption rate of discount, the bank would pay more for your savings than you think they
> a.re worth. Savings would increase, and the price of capital (i.e., the interest rate) would fall
> as the supply of investment increases. Vice versa, if the interest rate were lower, savings would
> fall and the interest rate would rise.
> 9.9 The choice of parameters**
> Table 6.1 and Figures 6. and 6.9 show just how important the discount rate is for the social
> cost of carbon and hence for optimal climate policy. Further examples are given throughout
> this chapter.
> Welfare functions can be based on ethical reasons or on empirical evidence,
> but should be consistent across policies.
> The pure rate of time preference, together with the rates of risk aversion and inequity
> aversion discussed below, is ofLen referred io as an "ethical parameter". For individuals, ethical
> parameters reflect the attitude towards the future, towards risk, and towards others. Such
> attitudes may be ba ed on moral rea oning or may result from ocial norms and upbringing.
> To an analyst, these parameters reflect the preferences of economic agents, and are measw·able.
> For society. these parameters also reflect attitudes, towards the future. towards risk, towards
> inequity within society, and towards inequity between societies. The parameters are
> measurable in the sense that decisions made can be interpreted as to their implied rates of time
> preference. risk aversion and inequity aversion. However, what is and what ought to be are
> different things. Besides, analyses of the preferences revealed by government decisions show
> inconsistent behaviour. It is the role of decision analysts to improve poHcy making by removing
> inconsistencies and weeding out decisions that please no one. It is the role of moral leaders to
> improve preferences so that decisions are better, too, in the ethical sense of the word.
> Ethical welfare functions are undemocratic. Empirical evidence is contradictory
> and difficult to interpret.
> This is a deep issue. Reasonable people cau and should disagree. The two polar positious
> arc as follows. You can take a philosophical approach, and reason from first principles what the
> pure rate of time preference should be. If you find that difficult, you can take guidance from a
> thought leader such as Aristotle, Laozi, .Jesus Christ, St Augustine, Mohammed, Adolf Hitler,
> Johnny Rotten, Lord Stern, or Lady Gaga. Alternatively, you can argue that government
> decisions should reflect the will of the people and try to measure that will.
> Almost all thought leaders who have expressed an opinion on time preference Aristotle, St
> Augustine, ~fohamrued, Thomas Aquiual:i, John Broome, aud Lord Stern ha,·e argued that it

**assistant**:
> Absolutely, here are several multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate whether students have understood the key concepts from the reading on climate ethics from Tol's textbook:
> 
> 1. What is the social cost of carbon?
>    - A) The total impact of climate change on society.
>    - B) The damage done by emitting an additional tonne of carbon dioxide.

>    - D) The cost of implementing climate change mitigation policies.
>    
>    **Correct Answer: C**
> 
> 2. The marginal damage cost of greenhouse gas emissions is also known as:

> 3. If the emissions trajectory is optimal, then the social cost of carbon equals:
>    - A) The marginal benefits of greenhouse gas emission reduction.
>    - B) The Pigou tax.
>    - C) The net present welfare optimization price.
>    - D) Both A and B.
>    
>    **Correct Answer: B**
> 
> 4. What affects the social cost of carbon, leading to widely different estimates?
>    - A) The political environment.
>    - B) The degree of public awareness.
>    - C) Many underlying factors like assumptions about emissions, climate change, and economic development.
>    - D) The current level of greenhouse gas emissions.
>    
>    **Correct Answer: C**
> 
> 5. How does the choice of the discount rate affect the social cost of carbon?
>    - A) It has no significant effect.
>    - B) A lower discount rate results in a higher social cost of carbon.
>    - C) A higher discount rate results in a higher social cost of carbon.
>    - D) Only extreme discount rates affect the social cost of carbon.
>    
>    **Correct Answer: B**
> 
> 6. What does the growth rate of the social cost of carbon indicate?
>    - A) It should decrease over time.
>    - B) It remains constant over time.
>    - C) It should rise by around 2% per year.
>    - D) It fluctuates based on current emissions levels.
>    
>    **Correct Answer: C**
> 
> 7. The probability density function (Figure 6.9) shows the social cost of carbon for all published studies that use a 3% pure rate of time preference (PRTP). What does it imply about the social cost of carbon?
>    - A) It remains the same regardless of the chosen PRTP.
>    - B) It changes significantly with different PRTPs, indicating the importance of time preference.
>    - C) It is least for studies with a 3% PRTP.
>    - D) It can be ignored as PRTP has minimal impact on climate policy.
>    
>    **Correct Answer: B**
> 
> 8. The social cost of carbon is described as being dependent on the discount rate. Which statement accurately represents this relationship?
>    - A) The social cost of carbon is inversely proportional to the discount rate.
>    - B) The social cost of carbon increases with a lower discount rate due to a heavier weight on future impacts.
>    - C) The social cost of carbon decreases as the discount rate decreases.
>    - D) The discount rate has no effect on the social cost of carbon.
> 
>    **Correct Answer: B**
> 
> These questions aim to test students' comprehension of the fundamental concepts of the social cost of carbon, its implications for climate policy, the impact of discount rates, and the reason behind varying estimates of the social cost of carbon.
