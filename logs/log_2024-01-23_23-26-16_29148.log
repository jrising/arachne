> I am writing to express my interest in continuing my studies in Water Resource Engineering. I have worked on " Modeling and Assessment of BMPs on Agricultural NPS Pollution Discharges into River Systems " as a graduate research assistant during my M.Sc. studies. From my thesis, up to now, I have published three papers in Science of The Total Environment, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment and Environmental Studies journal (Please see the publications here, here and here). In addition, I work as an independent Water Resource Manager at a consulting firm on Water Quality Management and Water Resource Projects.
> 
> Now, I am looking for somewhere to continue my studies, working on Hydrology and Watershed Management, Climate Change Impact on Hydrology and Water Quality and Surface Water-Groundwater Interactions. Your interesting research group activities indicate that I find the right place.
> 
> Please let me know if you will accept a new member in your research group. I would be honored if I could be a PhD student under your supervision.

**assistant**:
> Dear James,
> 
> I've reviewed the email from prospective student Nasrin Badrzadeh. She appears to have a solid background in Water Resource Engineering and has expressed interest in working on areas such as Hydrology and Watershed Management, Climate Change Impact on Hydrology and Water Quality, and Surface Water-Groundwater Interactions. 
> 
> Nasrin is not explicit about the program she's interested in, but based on her expressed areas of interest and previous experience, it seems that the Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program or one of the Marine Science & Policy natural science programs might be appropriate paths. 
> 
> She did not ask any particular questions or express any specific confusions. However, based on her background and professional goals, she might have concerns about program fit, potential research topics, and funding.
> 
> Moreover, Nasrin didn't mention whether she studied or is local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, or if she studied at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD. 
> 
> Here's a proposed response based on the template you provided:
> 
> Dear Nasrin,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Based on your background and research interests, you would be a good candidate for the Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/), which has a Marine track. Another path to explore might be one of the natural science programs offered by the Marine Science & Policy school. For this, I recommend reaching out to Professor Xinfeng Liang (xfliang@udel.edu).
> 
> Please note that funding for these programs is often limited, and prospective students are encouraged to apply by December 15 to be considered for any available funds. Given your interest in Climate Change Impact on Hydrology and Water Quality, you may align well with my research; if so, I would encourage you to mention that in your statement of purpose.
