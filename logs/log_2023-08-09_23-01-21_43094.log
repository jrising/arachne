> Below are a list of research priorities, culled from two lists.
> ---
> Enhanced Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Discuss the necessity of interdisciplinary discourse in integrating the latest physical science into economic assessments.
> Disaggregated Data and Integrating Local Information: Emphasize the need for context-specific, localized data in economic assessments for accurate representation of regional climate change impacts.
> Integrate extreme events and climate-induced hazards into economic assessments: Improve economic analysis of climate change by incorporating excluded hazard categories such as wildfires and flooding, enhancing damage functions in integrated assessment models, and exploring novel approaches to understand the economic impacts of extreme events and climate-induced hazards.
> Understand the impacts of Earth system tipping points and non-linear processes, and integrate these into economic assessments: Conduct research to better understand the potential physical impacts of global Earth system tipping points, as well as regional and local tipping points, while examining the links between ecological regime change and tipping points. Promote international cross-disciplinary collaboration to integrate these findings into economic assessments using a range of empirical data collection and modeling approaches.
> Account for adaptation in economic assessments of climate change: Conduct empirical analysis and model-based research to better understand the economic implications of existing and future planned adaptation responses to climate change. Incorporate adaptation into economic assessments at various scales, ranging from local to global, and communicate these findings to decision-makers to inform practical adaptation and development efforts.
> Increase focus on Adaptation and Development: Highlight the essential role of adaptation in economic analysis and policy-making to reduce the risks of climate change and support development goals.
> Integrate Nature and Health into Economic Assessments: Advocate for an inclusive approach that incorporates natural, health and social aspects of climate change within economic assessments.
> Understand the economic implications of climate change impacts on population displacement and migration: Conduct research to determine the extent to which changing climate conditions will influence future population displacement and migration flows. Integrate data on population displacement and migration into assessments estimating the economic impacts of climate change, considering the monetary costs associated with involuntary displacement due to extreme climate and weather events. Develop novel economic assessment approaches that include population displacement and migration, accounting for future socioeconomic drivers.
> Incorporate Ethics, Inequality, and Justice: Urge economic analysis to consider ethical dimensions in terms of obligations towards current and future generations and issues of global justice.
> Communicate Uncertainty through Storylines: Suggest novel approaches to communicating the potential range of climate impacts, addressing uncertainty in a manner relevant to policy-making.
> Address methodological challenges: Examine methodological challenges associated with analyzing circumstances and potential events that are outside the range of past human experience, including immense systemic events and instabilities, as well as local existential events. Evaluate the biases towards data-driven analysis and explore alternative approaches that are better suited to anticipate and analyze future uncertainties in climate change assessments.
