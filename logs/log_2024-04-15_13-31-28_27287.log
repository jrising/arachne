**assistant**:
> IMPLAN obtains its core Input-Output (I/O) data from several sources. These include:
> 
> 1. **The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**: The BEA provides detailed national level I/O tables which show how industries interact within an economy—specifically, how the output of one industry is consumed by other industries. This information constitutes the foundation of IMPLAN's data.
> 
> 2. **The Census Bureau's County Business Patterns Data and the Economic Census**: These resources provide information on employment, payroll, and the number of establishments at the county level. 
> 
> 3. **The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**: IMPLAN uses BLS data for rates of labor compensation to total industry output and employment figures. 
> 
> 4. **The USDA**'s Census of Agriculture provides data for farm related inputs and outputs.
> 
> 5. **Other governmental and private sector sources** can also be used to provide more detailed or specialty data where required.
> 
> When IMPLAN uses this data, it first constructs a national I/O model based on the BEA’s national I/O tables and additional sources. Then, using data primarily from County Business Patterns, it disaggregates the national model into county-level models. This involves economic adjustments for regional aspects such as trade flows, commuting patterns, and local taxes, which create differences between the national model and the county ones.

> It's important to note that IMPLAN's data is subject to the limitations and assumptions incorporated by these data providers, and additionally there is some time-lag between the availability of base data and its inclusion in IMPLAN's models.
