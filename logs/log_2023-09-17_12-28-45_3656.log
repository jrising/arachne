The ACP relied on an innovative online tool I developed for performing econometric meta-analyses (\url{http://dmas.berkeley.edu/}), designed to allow any researcher to expand the database of economic risks.  Drawing from my experience with the CIL's climate risk evaluation and my engagement with the community for detailed-processing modeling \citep{ciscar2019assessing}, I have developed a method to estimate damages across multiple risks that enables rapid, decentralized expansion of the collection of risks \citep{rising2022missing}.
