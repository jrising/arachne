> 
> The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) is truly grateful for the ongoing partnership of the Tilia Fund as we drive demand for high performance buildings that optimize energy, environmental, and economic performance for occupants and communities. We are appreciative of your continued support and proud to share a detailed review of our accomplishments from the past year through our grant report, found on page 8.
> 
> Under the leadership of our new Chief Executive Officer Alex Dews, IMT is moving into the middle phase of our decade-long Buildup 2030 plan. This phase is guided by our 2024-2027 strategic plan. We will build on our past accomplishments to create a world where buildings dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions and support our physical, social, and economic well-being. We will do this by accomplishing the following goals:
> 
> Design and adopt equitable building performance requirements nationwide by 2030.
> Make equitable decarbonization more accessible and actionable. 
> Scale Community Climate Shift (CCS) to deepen durable collaboration between community and government partners, leading to equitable building decarbonization policy design, adoption, and implementation. 
> 
> As we advance the key priorities identified in our strategic plan, we are also carefully considering the range of possible political and economic scenarios that will impact the context for our work. We are actively planning now in order to quickly and strategically adapt as needed, and have included a summary of our scenario planning below.
> 
> IMT respectfully requests $900,000 to resource the following work from June 2024 to June 2025. 
> 
> Design and Adopt Building Performance Requirements Nationwide by 2030
> 
> IMT is a national leader in Building Performance Standards (BPS) design, adoption, and implementation guidance. IMT guides cities and states across the country on their equitable building decarbonization plans through initiatives such as our partnership with President Biden’s National Building Performance Standards Coalition, which serves 47+ cities and states, and our model Building Performance Standards law and toolkit that has already been accessed by more than 500 stakeholders. 
> 
> From Spring 2024 to Spring 2025, IMT will scale our BPS offerings by accomplishing the following goals: 
> 
> Co-design and support policy change. IMT will collaborate with governments, communities, and other place-based stakeholders to design, adopt, and implement community-centered building improvement policies and implementation support programs which will achieve building decarbonization goals while advancing intersectional community priorities.
> 
> With critical federal funding now moving to cities and their local partners, 2024-2025 will be a time where we build momentum towards the next wave of building performance policy passage. IMT is currently supporting more than 30 cities and states where we expect to see new policies adopted by June 2025. Our primary focus is providing the necessary policy design and implementation support for building performance policies in more than 20 cities and states by 2026. 
> 
> IMT’s aim extends beyond merely developing and enacting policies; we collaborate closely with local stakeholders in government, community-based organizations, and local financial institutions to ensure they are able to draw down additional federal funding that supports their objectives. This strategy will catalyze broader BPS adoption and deliver significant non-energy benefits to communities, including enhanced resiliency, increased affordability, and improved public health outcomes.
> 
> Share power and knowledge. IMT will co-develop and proactively share a range of pathways for regulated building decarbonization. For example, we published our Community Accountability Board (CAB) toolkit this May. The purpose of this toolkit is to provide an examination of the foundational aspects of a CAB as well as the potential challenges and strategic considerations for creating and operating CABs. We are also preparing to publish resources outlining how BPS laws interact with newly constructed buildings and an examination of how BPS implementation is being achieved in the jurisdictions furthest along in their compliance cycles. 
> 
> IMT, a leading authority on building performance standards, plans to maintain and extend its influence through multiple avenues. We will present insights at several key conferences (Greenbuild 2024, the Getting to Zero Forum, and ACEEE Summer Study) by authoring four papers. The papers will cover an array of topics including green leasing, BPS implementation, tenant protections in California’s building performance policy, and fair decarbonization options in evolving legal settings. To further amplify our impact, we plan to build rapport with leading media outlets like Bloomberg, Grist, and Axios and attend over 50 conferences and events.
> 
> Engage utilities in a just transition. IMT will reform utility regulation in jurisdictions where we work to include buildings as assets for flexibly managing coincident peak demand. We will advance utility planning processes and regulation in 3-5 states by spring 2025. 
> 
> In 2023, we began supporting Louisiana Public Utilities Commissioner Davante Lewis by deploying three staff members to expand the impact of his work. Spring 2024 to 2025 will be the second year of this program, where we will focus on piloting and codifying a process for expanding communications and policy engagement that centers community priorities in statewide utility regulation in the Louisiana Public Service Commission District 3 office; hosting a series of town halls within the District with the dual purpose of disseminating information from the Commission and hearing consumer concerns within the parishes; and increasing participation in Commission processes by improving communication and more intentionally engaging impacted communities. This involves working closely with community-based organizations and advocates to understand key concerns, developing accessible materials and outreach strategies, and establishing ongoing feedback loops and accountability mechanisms between the Commission and impacted communities. The focus on codifying engagement processes is important to not only institutionalize these practices and enable their continuation beyond IMT’s direct involvement, but also to seek out opportunities to replicate this process in other states. 
> 
> Push for strong new construction standards and policies. IMT will advocate for high performance new construction policies and standards that balance affordability with efficiency and electrification. IMT will accomplish this by aligning energy code language with building performance standards through direct local and state agency participation and/or leveraging partnerships with peer organizations. 
> 
> Catalyze federal action. IMT will advocate for federal action and national strategies that advance and support high-performance and resilient building standards. Our staff member Lindsay Falasca, who is seconded to the White House Council on Environmental Quality, will continue to support building decarbonization goals across the federal government and will work closely with agencies to implement their strategies. This work includes new requirements that will be added to the General Services Administration’s standard lease form for federal buildings in preparation for Executive Order 14057’s requirement for all leased government spaces that occupy over 75% of the building to be net zero.  
> 
> As noted above, IMT is also scenario planning around the possible outcomes of this election year as well the current economic realities faced by the real estate sector. As a non-partisan organization with more than twenty years of experience navigating political transitions at the federal, state, and local level, we are well-positioned to adapt our approach to advancing building decarbonization. 
> 
> Our deep relationships with partners at all levels of government, as well as stakeholders in the real estate, utility, and energy sectors, ensure that we have a path to driving progress toward our mission across a wide range of political and economic scenarios. We are actively planning now so that we are able to quickly and strategically adjust our approach as needed. Below is a summary of our scenario planning.
> 
> If there is not an administration change, IMT will:
> Promote ambitious climate policy by continuing to engage with and support the White House Council on Environmental Quality and federal agencies to leverage their existing administrative authority. Agencies include the Department of Energy, Securities Exchange Commission, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Environmental Protection Agency. 
> Support priority local governments and organizations through the National Building Performance Standards Coalition to design, adopt, and implement BPS.
> Apply directly, and support partner applications, for federal funding available to advance equitable building decarbonization goals.
> Explore pathways for the expansion of federal energy efficiency and building improvement requirements.
> IMT is preparing for this scenario now by: 
> Strengthening partnerships at federal agencies and supporting programmatic goals that are on aggressive timelines ahead of the November election. 
> Supporting government and community partners to navigate and leverage opportunities the Biden Administration is releasing through September 2024 to access funding that will resource decarbonization efforts over the next several years. 
> 
> If there is a change in administration, IMT will: 
> Shift toward total focus on state and local support for building decarbonization policy design, adoption, and implementation. 
> Leverage private sector climate commitments to advance building decarbonization in the absence of federal leadership.
> Provide policy and legal assistance to state and local government stakeholders against legal challenges to current policies and offer strategies to avoid triggering preemption.
> Establish agreements with the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency between November 2024 and January 2025 to support necessary knowledge transfer from the past several years of federal climate policy and program development, and leverage IMT’s platform as a space to share key tools and documents around building performance in case resources are removed from federal websites.
> 
> 	IMT is preparing for this scenario by:
> Assisting the current administration in its goal to finalize federal funding awards that support building decarbonization work with state and local governments, community, and private sector partners. 
> Continuing to support federal agencies in adopting new energy efficiency policies and practices that will survive an administration change. We will focus on building relationships and support within these agencies that will allow us to continue offering assistance through the transition
> 
> Make equitable decarbonization more accessible and actionable 
> 
> Creating policies that drive demand is only part of the equitable building decarbonization solution. To effectively improve buildings so that they reduce emissions and improve quality of life for frontline communities (those who experience the first and worst effects of climate change), IMT will continue to empower more stakeholders to participate in decarbonizing the building sector. 
> 
> From spring 2024 to spring 2025, IMT will focus on the following goals: 
> 
> Deploy a portfolio of implementation support solutions. IMT will offer real-time resources and connections to real estate stakeholders to equitably address the multiple barriers to building renovation investment and implementation. IMT’s Building Performance Partnership (BPP) is our key strategy for deploying these supports. 
> 
> BPP is a network of place-based resource Hubs that provide BPS and related policy compliance support such as a funding and financing database to identify the financial resources for energy efficiency projects, playbooks to understand the nuances of navigating compliance, and vendor matchmaking services to connect building owner and operators with vendors who are experts in energy efficiency. Current Hub locations include Washington, D.C., Kansas City, St. Louis, New York City, and Chicago, with Philadelphia, Aspen, and Minneapolis/St. Paul in development. 
> 
> Additionally, through our Building Performance Partnership work, IMT is a proud member of the Justice Climate Fund coalition, which has recently been selected as an awardee of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program. This is an amazing opportunity to bring building improvements to underserved communities, and is also a first step in scaling climate aligned lending through the financial industry. IMT will position BPP as a way to scale community-led market development to provide needed support and resources to the real estate industry so they can appropriately leverage this pivotal federal investment. 
> 
> Provide tiered levels of implementation support. We will create a tiered approach to IMT implementation services designed to scale deeply with local partners in our priority locations, scale out by sharing our knowledge and approach with the field, and scale up by offering accessible online resources that provide up-to-date information to a variety of audiences.  
> 
> IMT sees an opportunity to leverage our leadership role on building decarbonization policy in the U.S. by supporting the advancement of building performance policies globally, with a particular focus on Europe - which is advancing new Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for existing buildings - and Asia, where building benchmarking is expanding and building performance policies are in development. IMT has already had high-level engagement with the EU on overall best practices, but as European member states move to adopt the general MEPS framework in the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EBD) in a way that suits their local context, we see a critical opportunity to increase impact.  
> 
> IMT will share lessons learned from implementing building performance policies across the U.S. with EU member states as a way to ease the transition to new policies and practices in the European market. We will reference IMT’s current library of resources, including the BPS model law, and will provide new material that will be specific to the European audience. IMT already has been successful at translating our work internationally through formal advisory work in Vancouver, Canada–where we were part of the team that designed the first BPS adopted in Canada–as well as ad-hoc advising to Toronto, Canada; Seoul, South Korea; and Melbourne, Australia.
> 
> Support inclusive workforce development for frontline communities. IMT will build relationships, via the Building Performance Partnership network, with workforce development and economic inclusion partners so they can provide technical assistance and advisory services on equitable BPS. 
> 
> We are currently piloting three workforce development initiatives through the Building Innovation Hub in Washington, D.C. that will run from Spring 2024 to Spring 2025. These initiatives include a career map for those looking to begin or advance their green buildings career path and a Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BPIOC) Contractor Accelerator, co-led with Emerald Cities Collaborative, for BIPOC contractors to gain the skills needed to secure large green buildings contracts. (do we want to include a link to this DOE map: https://dcdoee.careerpathplatform.com/map/
> 
> Scale Community Climate Shift to deepen impactful community-government equitable decarbonization policy design, adoption, and implementation relationships
> 
> IMT will scale Community Climate Shift (CCS) to support community-based organizations and local governments as they work together to ensure that building decarbonization policies contribute to a Just Transition and reflect community priorities across the country. 
> 
> In spring 2024 to spring 2025, IMT will continue our CCS work in New Jersey; Orlando, FL; Philadelphia, PA, and San Francisco, CA. We will also apply the principles of CCS in nine locations through the support of our $5,000,000 award from the Department of Energy’s Resilient and Efficient Codes Initiative. These locations are as follows: California; Chicago, IL; Kansas City, MO; Minneapolis, MN; New Orleans, LA; Philadelphia, PA; St. Louis, MO; Washington DC; and Washington State. 
> 
> We will accomplish this work through the following goals: 
> 
> Drive creation and implementation of innovative policy that will not only reduce energy and carbon in the built environment, but also address resilience, grid impacts, occupant health, and economic inclusion. IMT will support community-centered building decarbonization policy work, based on community needs, in each of the jurisdictions listed above. For example, New Orleans stakeholders are developing a Building Performance Standard that builds off of their energy benchmarking program, and the City of St. Louis is approaching their first building performance standard compliance deadline. 
>  
> Create or strengthen collaboration infrastructure between community and government partnerships to create lasting impacts for future policy design. IMT and our CCS partners will grow community and government collaboration infrastructure. We recently onboarded four community-based organizations (CBOs) to build working relationships with their state or local government counterparts. These CBOs include People for Community Recovery in Chicago, Building Energy, Equity & Power (BEEP) Coalition in California, Alliance for Affordable Energy in New Orleans, and Community Builders Network in St. Louis. We will facilitate joint kickoff calls between the local government and the CBOs over the next month, and move forward with their joint goals shortly after. 
> 
> Continue to develop and evolve CCS’s governance model to better center 
> community-accountable organizations. In the last year, the CCS core team stood up and staffed a Steering Committee made up of nine members who have oversight on how strategic decisions are made, and how funding is allocated. Seven committee members are filled by representatives of community-based organizations or organizations focused on climate justice, with the remaining two members representing organizations focused on building decarbonization. IMT is staffing the Steering Committee to ensure that administrative and coordination needs are supported. 
> 
> IMT is grateful for the opportunity to request a renewal from the Tilia Fund. Your partnership will resource critical programs, policies, and supports that advance the role of buildings in climate policy, and move us towards a future where buildings are energy efficient, climate resilient, and support the communities they serve. By working with IMT, The Tilia Fund would be able to apply robust, scientifically-backed solutions to some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

> July 2023- May 2024
> 
> Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) grew and scaled our equitable building decarbonization efforts across the nation from July 2023 to May 2024. Among our other accomplishments, the generous partnership of the Tilia Fund allowed us to:
> 
> Support 40+ jurisdictions to engage with Building Performance Standards (BPS) by providing model law resources, federal funding application support, and curated technical assistance. 
> Work alongside six jurisdictions and five community-based organizations around the country to pilot a Community Accountability Board cohort. 
> Ease implementation for Building Performance Standards (BPS) and related decarbonization policies for varied stakeholders by continuing to provide adoption and implementation resources. 
> Welcome a new cohort of 54 landlords, 8 tenants, and 3 teams to Green Lease Leaders.
> 
> This year was particularly critical for Community Climate Shift because we shifted from planning program components and building diverse stakeholder relationships to implementing collaborative community-government projects on equitable building decarbonization. Over the grant period, IMT: 
> Built Community Climate Shift’s national movement infrastructure to appropriately support a range of partners, including local and state governments, community-based organizations (CBOs), and technical assistance providers, to equitably and efficiently collaborate.
> Developed and implemented a formal governance plan that centers community leadership.
> Supported deep, place-based work in four communities and began outreach to nine more.
> Secured a $5M award from the U.S. Department of Energy to assist local and state governments as they build collaborative climate action plans with community partners. 
> 
> Internally, IMT developed a new strategic plan to inform our efforts over the next three years (2024-2027) and navigated an intentional executive transition with Alex Dews taking the role of Chief Executive Officer in April, 2024. 
> 
> Additionally, IMT elevated our thought leadership in the field by being quoted in 26 articles, including Building Green’s Seeking a Just Transition to a Decarbonized Built Environment and Axio’s New York jump-starts the “buildings decarbonization” trend. 
> 
> We are excited to share our progress in detail below regarding the following deliverables proposed in our May 11, 2023 request.
> 
> IMT provided critical support to 20+ cities and states as they designed and adopted next-generation building performance policies to equitably decarbonize buildings in a way that concurrently tackled cross-cutting community needs. 
> 
> As the national leader on Building Performance Standards (BPS), and the manager of President Biden’s National Building Performance Standards Coalition, IMT offered a variety of BPS supports such as webinars and asynchronous resources to the participating governments in the coalition. More than 20 members received critical technical policy design and implementation support, strategic federal funding matchmaking and application support, and community engagement resources as they designed, adopted, and implemented BPS over this grant period. IMT also provided essential support to jurisdictions that have not yet joined the Coalition to ensure that all jurisdictions had access to these important materials. 
> 
> We accomplished this by: 
> Sharing IMT’s model Building Performance Standard law and suite of supporting resources with over 500 stakeholder who downloaded materials. To ensure the model law resources were widely accessible, IMT shared the resources with over 5,000 newsletter subscribers and hosted a five-part webinar series related to Building Performance Standard law titled Better Buildings for Everyone. The series explored topics of community engagement, legal pathways to BPS, and implementation tools such as Building Performance Hubs with guest panelists including the Public Health Law Center, Environmental Protection Agency, City of Denver, and the Kansas City Hub. The series reached over 850 attendees from across industries and communities including organizations in localities committed to the National BPS Coalition.
> 
> Supporting 23 jurisdictions on BPS planning, 4 on BPS development, and 10 on BPS implementation. For example, we are actively working with the City of Philadelphia’s Sustainability Office on the development of a BPS policy, as well as matchmaking federal grants to support development and forecasting implementation needs. In Oregon, IMT is advising the state’s Rulemaking Advisory Committee on the rulemaking process for their BPS law. 
> 
> City and state governments frequently shared their need for technical assistance to apply for federal funding opportunities that are connected to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act to resource their BPS goals. IMT provided key support such as application drafting, budget document navigation, and invitations for partnership in 23 instances for federal grant opportunities such as the Technical Assistance for the Adoption of Building Energy Codes and the Energy Futures grant. While many applications are still being considered, cities and states who we assisted may receive millions in funding to pursue equitable building decarbonization projects.
> 
> Convening an Advisory Committee of Chicago and Los Angeles-based CBOs and several national healthy buildings organizations, in partnership with NRDC and Elevate, to identify community priorities around health in the context of BPS to begin creating recommendations for expanded policy options. We anticipate this report will be completed by June 2024.
> 
> Support the adoption and implementation of equitable, community-centered building performance policies in multiple jurisdictions
> 
> IMT continues to support jurisdictions as they implement Building Performance Standards to help cities and states ensure their programs are equitable and center community needs. Our work helps cities employ legal defenses against preemption, build relationships with community-based organizations, and create equitable enforcement mechanisms. 
> 
> We accomplished this by: 
> 
> Hosting a webinar, in partnership with the Public Health Law Center (PHLC), for local and state governments to break down the 9th circuit decision on California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley (a successful preemption effort on Berkeley’s natural gas ban) and discuss implications for what policy solutions related to building decarbonization are still viable to undertake, such as BPS and net-zero building energy codes. Additionally, we hosted a ‘Legal Pathways to BPS’ webinar with the Public Health Law Center through the Better Buildings for Everyone series. This event had 126 attendees and laid out the legal pathways creating the right policies to navigate and avoid preemption challenges and potential lawsuits. 
> 
> Sharing our Community Engagement Framework with over 200 stakeholders including governments, CBOs, and technical assistance providers. This resource, as well as our process guide and conflict resolution guide, drove the co-development of energy efficiency and climate solutions that identify and address the challenges, priorities, and aspirations of frontline communities through meaningful community engagement.
> 
> Piloting a cohort of government and community-based organizations, specifically CBOs that serve low-income and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, to evaluate the effectiveness of the Community Accountability Board framework and implementation. The pilot began in December 2023 and will end in April 2024. It is comprised of governments and CBOs from the following cities: Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Portland, OR, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Kansas City, and Orlando.
> 
> Increase the Ease of Scaling the BPS framework while Strengthening Impact
> 
> Streamlining building retrofit and climate action efforts encourages real estate stakeholders, governments, and CBOs to adopt BPS practices. By easing BPS adoption and compliance, we are scaling the BPS framework and strengthening impact across the nation. 
> 
> We accomplished this by:
> Continuing to deploy IMT’s Lindsey Falasca to work at The White House Council on Environmental Quality as the director of Net Zero Buildings. Her recent work included advancing ongoing strategic and data drive processes for robust planning and action using data driven insights to implement the Buildings Strategic Planning Framework, and working towards setting green leasing guidelines that will send a signal to the industry on federal requirements while setting an example for other leasing organizations to follow, thereby moving the market toward net zero emissions buildings. 
> 
> Addressing states that are significantly lagging in adoption of efficient energy codes, and in some locations are looking to roll requirements back or solidify their outdated status through legislative action, and codes that are being repealed and opposed across the nation. IMT’s codes team worked to raise awareness on this issue by partnering with and informing media about the dangers of outdated energy codes, like Bloomberg Business News and The Washington Post. IMT also equipped stakeholders with a toolkit, Taking Action for Strong Energy Codes, which explains how one can play a role in advocating for adoption of the strongest, most efficient energy codes.
> 
> Launching a series on Utilities and Public Utility Commissions as a resource to build institutional capacity and expertise for CBOs to effectively engage in the power sector decision-making process. By demystifying the complex history, operations, and decision-making processes of utilities, this educational content empowers CBOs to confidently translate their community’s energy priorities into actionable technical recommendations. The series highlights real-world impacts and case studies relevant to target regions like the Midwest and Southeast, equipping readers with place-based insights. Providing accessible explanations of utility jargon and regulatory proceedings further enables grassroots advocates to strategically intervene in utility planning and investment decisions, specifically as it relates to advancing equitable building decarbonization solutions. Ultimately, this series enhances CBO leaders’ ability to advocate for energy justice, hold utilities accountable to the public interest, and shape a more equitable, resilient energy future for their communities.
> 
> Facilitating the creation of a Whole Building Utility Data Access bill to start the process of utility data transparency. With help from the Regulatory Assistance Project, in late 2023 IMT developed and published a model utility data access law that provides a framework for states to ensure that building owners have access to the whole building energy data they need to make informed decisions about building improvements and operations that will save energy, benefit tenants, and reduce emissions. 
> 
> The data is also needed to benchmark buildings, comply with BPS, and for buildings to qualify for $6.6 billion in IRA incentives, some of which the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has targeted for affordable housing. The data is also needed for calculating affordable housing utility allowances, energy burden, and the equity impacts of government and utility policies and programs. We are currently partnering with the Building Owners and Management Association (BOMA) to promote this model law. A bill based on the model has been introduced in Vermont, and will likely be reintroduced in 2025. Policymakers in other states are also reviewing the model.
> 
> Hosting three embedded staff positions to support Commissioner Davante Lewis and the Public Service Commission of Louisiana. The goal of the project is to serve the people of Louisiana and advance access to affordable, reliable, clean energy for all. 
> 
> We provide local advisory staff capacity to support Commissioner Lewis to engage community members in activities and initiatives happening at the Commission; craft clear communications about initiatives happening at the Commission; and advise Commissioner Lewis on emerging climate and environmental policies connected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. These staff have supervision from IMT to support their employment and professional development, and are responsive to Commissioner Lewis and his staff in conducting the business of the Commission.
> 
> Strengthen IMT’s support to building stakeholders across the country to comply with Building Performance Standards
> 
> IMT works with real estate owners, operators, vendors, contractors, and other companies to support planning for and compliance with building performance standards. 
> 
> We accomplished this by: 
> 
> Seeding new Building Performance Partnership Hubs in Minneapolis and St.Paul, Philadelphia, and in the Aspen, Colorado region. These Hubs will provide resources and support to building industry stakeholders such as building owners/operators, contractors, tenants, and designers by building capacity and infrastructure to enable building retrofits at scale.
> 
> Additionally, we support our current Network of Hubs (based in Washington DC, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and New York City) by conducting monthly trainings and meetings for Hub leaders, and hosting a joint webinar series to inform stakeholders across the country on the federal incentives and programs that are available. Over 1,000 people attended the webinar series with each Hub hosting a combination of local and national speakers in partnership with the Building Performance Partnership.
> 
> Facilitating holistic BPS compliance support and programs for DC’s real estate community through DC’s Building Innovation Hub. In 2023, the Hub provided critical guidance to owners and operators of 650 buildings to understand DC’s Building Energy Performance Standard (BEPS) through their “Success with BEPS” program. This effort, combined with other Hub activities, helped Washington DC reach a 90% compliance rate with the first compliance period for the new law.
> 
> Recognizing the success of 54 landlords, 8 tenants, and 3 teams through the Green Lease Leaders (GLL) Program. These leaders collectively hold portfolios that cover a diverse range of buildings, from commercial offices to industrial buildings, data centers, retail, and multifamily residential buildings. IMT created and piloted several new GLL application support tools to increase our capacity to invite and process new applicants in 2024 while enhancing the applicant experience. These tools included office hours sessions where applicants could ask IMT staff specific questions about their application, GLL application workbooks for each applicant type and level in Excel, and the opportunity to schedule a one-on-one application review. 
> 
> The Corporate Engagement Opportunities program expanded to include a new Energy Policy Database offering, which connects critical policy information via Application Programming Interface (API) into the tools that the real estate industry is using. Connecting the building stakeholders to the policy requirements via this application allows them to better understand and prioritize building decarbonization strategies.
> 
> Build Community Climate Shift’s national Movement Infrastructure
> 
> During the past year, IMT focused on building Community Climate Shift’s national infrastructure and governance, making initial place-based investments, and securing federal funding. Now, with a strong national movement infrastructure and a deep, trust-based network of partners, Community Climate Shift (CCS) is prepared to support place-based collaborations across more than a dozen jurisdictions in 2024. 
> 
> Highlights of last year’s accomplishments include:

> In May 2023, we convened CCS partners to align on the initial phase of Community Climate Shift implementation and to outline how community perspectives will be woven through all elements of the initiative. As mentioned in our application above, a steering committee composed of environmental justice and community-based organizations now guides CCS’s resource allocation. The core values guiding this work are based on the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing, which include inclusivity, bottom-up organizing, and working together in solidarity and mutuality. We are committed to maintaining a collaborative governance and decision-making model that honors consensus building and authentic, accessible participation that results in informed outcomes toward community-driven solutions.

> In July 2023, The U.S. Department of Energy selected IMT and its partners for a $5M award to support community-centered policy and program creation using the principles of Community Climate Shift. This funding is through the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation opportunity, which is part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The purpose of the grant is to create relationships and shared goals between local governments and community members that produce equitable building performance policies and supporting programs. The funding supports technical assistance providers to manage this process and provide the necessary analysis, research, and facilitation to design and implement place-based equitable building decarbonization programs. As mentioned above in the application, this grant will allow us to support the following state and local governments: California; Chicago, IL; New Orleans, LA; Philadelphia, PA; Washington DC; Kansas City, MO; St. Louis, MO; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington State. 
> 
> In each CCS location, community-based organizations receive direct funding and technical support from decarbonization-focused partner to support community priority climate action. This often includes policy efforts, seeding workforce development initiatives for building improvements, and increasing housing and energy affordability. During the grant period, an initial investment of $580,000 total was made to support four CCS collaborations in Orlando (Grassroots Impact + Central Florida Jobs with Justice), San Francisco (PODER + Emerald Cities Collaborative), Philadelphia (POWER Interfaith), and New Jersey (NJ Environmental Justice Alliance). 
> 
> IMT and our partner, Climate Innovation, conducted ecosystem mapping efforts to identify and onboard CBO partners in eight additional jurisdictions. These CBO partners will lead the work to integrate their priorities into their local government’s building decarbonization efforts. CBOs were selected through a rigorous research and interview process that highlights non-power holders, uplifts frontline community-centered organizations, and prioritizes organizations that have multiple intersections to our key focus areas (e.g. Just Transition, housing justice, energy justice).

> Thank you for your ongoing support! The Tilia Fund’s partnership resourced IMT to accomplish the work detailed above, leading to lasting transformations that move us toward a world where buildings dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions and support our physical, social, and economic well-being.
