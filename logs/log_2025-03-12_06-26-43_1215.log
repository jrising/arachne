> Dear HR Team,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a reconsideration of the severance package offered to me on March 7, 2025. 
> 
> I have been a dedicated employee of [Company Name] for 13 months, during which time I have successfully brought in substantial revenue and secured numerous grants that have significantly contributed to the companyâ€™s growth and financial stability. It has been a privilege to be a part of this team and witness firsthand the positive impact our work has on our clients and community.
> 
> Given my contributions, and personal circumstances, I am requesting an adjustment to the severance package initially offered. I am over 40 years old and the primary breadwinner in my family. My children and I rely heavily on my salary for our well-being and livelihood. The severance of one week that was provided falls short of offering us the stability and security needed during this transition period.
> 
> An enhanced severance package would greatly assist in my search for new employment and help alleviate the financial stress on my family. I am hopeful for your understanding and willingness to discuss a more equitable severance arrangement.
> 
> Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for your support during this difficult time. I am available at your earliest convenience to discuss this request further.
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> [Your Name]

> Feel free to modify any sections to better fit your personal style or add any additional details you believe may strengthen your case. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!
