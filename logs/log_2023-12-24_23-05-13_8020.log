**user**:
> I am upgrading an old version of MediaWiki, but when I try to do the database I update, it tries to access data in the media_actor table, and my database has no such table. What can I do?
**assistant**:
> It seems like you're hitting a snag due to the introduction of the actor table, which came about in MediaWiki version 1.31. It's possible that the table doesn't exist because you haven't run the upgrade script yet, which will add it.
> 
> Here are the steps you should follow to conduct this upgrade:
> 
> 1. Backup your database. This is an essential step before making any significant changes to your database.
> 
> 2. If you haven't done so already, download the MediaWiki version you wish to upgrade to.
> 
> 3. Point your MediaWiki Installation to the new source files. Typically, this means updating the application files for MediaWiki with the ones from your new downloaded version.
> 
> 4. After backing up your data and setting up the new MediaWiki files, you should then run the upgrade script. This typically is done via a command-line interface using the "update.php" maintenance script.
> 
> Here is an example of how you might use it:
> 
> ```bash
> cd /path/to/your/mediawiki/maintenance
> php update.php
> ```
> This script should manage the schema changes for you, such as adding the new 'actor' table.
> 
> 5. Check the "actor" table's presence now. The update script should've created it.
> 
> Please keep in mind this is a general guide, the exact steps may vary depending on your server setup. Be sure to follow the [specific upgrading instructions](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading) provided by MediaWiki.
> 
> If you've completed these steps and the problem persists, it's possible there may be extensions or custom code interfering. You could attempt the upgrade on a stripped-down copy of your MediaWiki (with no extensions, custom skins, etc.) and see if the problem still occurs. This would help narrow down the issue. 
> 
> Finally, if all else fails, consider reaching out to the MediaWiki community for assistance - they often have in-depth, expert knowledge on these sorts of issues. Good luck with your upgrade!
