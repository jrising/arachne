> summarize this please : Steven Winter Associates, Inc. provides research, consulting and advisory services to improve commercial, residential and multifamily built environments for private and public sector clients. We specialize in energy, sustainability and accessibility consulting as well as certification, research & development and compliance services. Our engineers and architects have led the way since 1972 in the development of best practices to achieve high performance buildings. As a matter of course, we collaborate with our clients to produce the most cost-effective and innovative solutions.
> 
> Our History
> When Steven Winter Associates, Inc. was launched in 1972, it was in part a result of Steven Winter, then a young architect, realizing how inefficient buildings were in their design and construction methods, and in their use of man-made and natural resources. Over the last 50 years, the core mission of the firm has stayed true to its origins. We work to improve the planet’s buildings and communities by optimizing their construction and operation, by improving the systems and products they are made of, and by enhancing the services they house.
> 
> Our success has come from providing superior services and innovative solutions, while exceeding our clients expectations, and inspiring them to do more. Much of our business is repeat business from clients who have realized the benefits of choosing the most proactive solutions, like going green long before it became a trend or an important standard of business practice. We have always believed that our strength comes from hiring the best people and providing them with an environment for growth and enjoyment. We are a strong and proactive voice in the industry for high performance buildings, and we enjoy a visible role in delivering this message through the media, associations and events.
> 
> Our clients – in government, industry, and the private sector – have awarded us the opportunity to work on projects as varied as the impact of the green, energy, and accessibility issues in residential, multifamily and commercial buildings. Our research in building science and technology has inspired new ways of solving construction challenges nationwide. And, our efforts in information dissemination and tech transfer have helped to inform stakeholders in both public and private sectors.
> 
> We are proud of our history and accomplishments over the years, but the real story of SWA is the future. There is still much to be done to improve the built environment.
