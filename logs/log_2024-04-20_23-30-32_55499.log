> I have a string in R and I want to find all of the individual words in that string (or, presented another way, each case that matches a given regex). How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> You can easily extract words from a string in R by using the `strsplit()` or `str_extract_all()` functions. 
> 
> Here is an example using `strsplit()`:
> 
> ```r
> # A string in R
> my_string <- "Hello, this is a test string."
> 
> # Strsplit() to split the string into words 
> word_list <- strsplit(my_string, "\\s+")
> 
> # Print the resulting list
> print(word_list)
> ```
> 
> In this script, `"\\s+"` is a regular expression (regex) that matches one or more whitespaces.
> 
> You can also use stringr library's `str_extract_all()` function to extract matching patterns. You need to provide the string and the pattern you want to match:
> 
> ```r
> # Load the stringr library
> library(stringr)
> 
> my_string <- "Hello, this is a test string."
> 
> # Use str_extract_all to find all words in the string
> words <- str_extract_all(my_string, "\\b\\w+\\b")
> 
> # Print the resulting list
> print(words)
> ```
> 
> In the regex `"\\b\\w+\\b"`:
> 
> - `\\b` indicates a word boundary, so you avoid matching parts of words.
> - `\\w+` matches one or more "word" characters (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`). The `+` means 'one or more' of the preceding character or group. 
> 
> So together, `\\b\\w+\\b` matches entire words. These words will be output as a list where each element contains all the matches for the corresponding element of the input.
