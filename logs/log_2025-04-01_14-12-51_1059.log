> 
> We are a trusted, science-based, and independent guide for effective climate action across the globe.
> 
> Our work is built on three pillars:
> 
> SCIENCE. First, we conduct cutting-edge research to identify the best possible climate solutions – and to design the most effective strategies to bring them to scale. Then, we share our findings with the world through highly effective science communication, marketing campaigns, and media partnerships.
> STAKEHOLDERS. Next, we use our science to inform and inspire stakeholders – including philanthropists, investors, business leaders, policymakers, and community change-makers to take bold leadership positions and bring effective climate action to the world.
> STORIES. Finally, we use the power of storytelling to help shift the narrative on climate change – from problem to solution and from “doom and gloom” toward “opportunity and possibility.” Along the way, we elevate new voices and showcase new climate heroes changing the world.
> We strongly believe that good science is needed to guide effective climate action. We also believe that science must be shared in actionable and compelling ways – through stakeholder engagement and powerful storytelling. Our job is to make this happen.
> 
> About the Role
> Project Drawdown is a “science first” organization. Everything we do is built on a foundation of science and evidence. With this new role, we seek to create new partnerships that are built on science-based strategies – including the “time value of carbon”, “emergency brake” climate solutions (like addressing methane and deforestation emissions), targeting geographic “hot spots” with disproportionate climate impact, and seeking solution “benefit bundles” that go far beyond carbon.
> 
> We seek candidates that can start with this “science first” foundation, and then build powerful partnerships that can help accelerate climate action in new, effective ways. We strongly believe that these science-based strategies can help the world make tremendous progress on climate change – making up for lost time. We will seek business, philanthropy, and investor partners who want to join us in making this happen.

> Conduct research to build a network of partners who are leaders in climate change solutions, keeping up to date with global trends and partnership opportunities.
> Build and maintain high-impact relationships with partners.
