> I am writing a grant proposal, describing a project that I have now pushed in a couple of different forms. Here are two descriptions:
> ===
> Version 1: The coastal economy is subject to a spectrum of economic risks and opportunities. Infrastructure and assets are vulnerable to flooding and sea-level rise. Tourism, a vital sector, is subject to fluctuations due to shifting behaviors. Additionally, the natural environment faces mounting threats from multiple forms of environmental change. However, within these challenges lie significant economic opportunities. As appreciation for beautiful environments escalates, and businesses adapt to the changing needs of an aging population, new avenues for growth become apparent.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer will provide a dashboard of regularly updated data reflecting the coastal economy's overall health, thereby supporting infrastructural planning, informed land-use decisions, and accurate forecasting of developmental impacts. The dashboard will report an overall economic and environmental health measure, backed up by a variety of informative indicators. These indicators will include direct and indirect economic outputs, climate and other environmental risks, and measures of economic resilience.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer developed in this project will be made publicly available, but it will only represent a first version of the tool. Based on feedback from stakeholders using the tool, future versions would include more indicators and present the information in other ways.
> ===
> Version 2: Understanding the dynamism of the coastal economy is a prerequisite for better resource allocation and maximizing economic potential. Both internal and external forces can present risks and opportunities. Developing a “Coastal Barometer” of these changing forces would crucially inform a holistic understanding of the coastal economy's health.

> Therefore, it is essential to realize that a healthy economy is not merely prosperous but resilient, armed to adapt to and mitigate risks, and ready to seize the ensuing opportunities. The complexity of the coastal economy, laden with diverse risks and opportunities, makes it challenging to capture its entirety within any set of metrics. However, the methodologies born from sustainable development and inclusive accounting offer a robust foundation for encapsulating the economic underpinnings of future prosperity.
> 
> A "Coastal Barometer" could serve as an invaluable tool for Delaware's coasts, offering a regularly updated dashboard of indices on the coastal economy's health. This tool would not simply reflect the immediate condition of the coastal economy but would also elucidate its connections to the broader state and national economies. In essence, the Barometer would offer an integrated, up-to-date snapshot of the economy's overall health, spanning from the local to the national level.
> 
> The proposed Coastal Barometer is more than a mere statistical index; it is a pathway towards comprehensive economic understanding. By making these data readily available, coastal community officials will be better equipped to identify beneficial infrastructure investments and make more informed land-use decisions. Understanding the scale of the economic contributions from coastal-related activities also helps planners forecast the effects of new developments more accurately, ensuring that investments are appropriately sized.
> 
> Thus, the Coastal Barometer serves as a critical instrument, not only monitoring the pulse of the coastal economy but also guiding its future, making it a potential cornerstone of sustainable and inclusive development for Delaware.
> ===
> 
> Can you take these descriptions and come up with one consensus description of the vision for the Coastal Barometer?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here’s a consensus description synthesizing the visions from both versions:

> **Vision for the Coastal Barometer**
> 
> The Coastal Barometer is conceived as a transformative tool designed to capture and convey the dynamic health of the coastal economy. Subject to a range of economic risks and opportunities, the coastal economy's infrastructure and assets face vulnerabilities such as flooding and sea-level rise, while sectors like tourism experience shifts induced by changing consumer behaviors. Concurrently, the natural environment navigates threats from multifaceted environmental change. Yet, these challenges also unveil significant economic opportunities, driven by rising appreciation for natural beauty and the evolving needs of an aging population.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer aims to provide a comprehensive dashboard of regularly updated data, reflecting the coastal economy's overall health. It will support strategic planning, informed land-use decisions, and accurate forecasting of developmental impacts by reporting both an overarching economic and environmental health measure, supplemented by diverse indicators. These indicators will cover direct and indirect economic outputs, climate and other environmental risks, and gauges of economic resilience.
> 
> By leveraging methodologies inherent in sustainable development and inclusive accounting, the Coastal Barometer will illuminate the intricate interplay between the coastal economy and broader state and national economic frameworks. This integrative approach not only captures the immediate state of economic health but also signals opportunities for growth and resilience.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer is more than a statistical tool; it is a pathway to deeper economic insight. By simplifying access to this vital information, it empowers coastal community leaders to make more informed decisions about infrastructure investments and land-use planning. The tool also enables planners to accurately anticipate the impacts of new developments, aligning them with sustainable and inclusive growth objectives.
> 
> Envisioned as a critical instrument for Delaware's coasts, the Coastal Barometer will initially be released in its foundational version, with future iterations expanding its scope and utility based on stakeholder feedback. Ultimately, it will serve not only as a monitoring device but as a guiding force for sustainable economic development, cementing its role as a cornerstone of enduring prosperity.
