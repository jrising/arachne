**assistant**:
> To make paper sticky with rubber cement, follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Apply a small amount of rubber cement onto one of the surfaces that you want to stick together. Be careful not to apply too much, as this can cause the paper to wrinkle or warp.
> 
> 2. Spread the rubber cement evenly over the surface of the paper using a brush or a cotton swab. Make sure that you cover the entire surface of the paper, including the edges.
> 
> 3. Press the two surfaces together firmly, making sure that they are aligned properly. Hold them in place for a few seconds to ensure a strong bond.
> 
> 4. Allow the rubber cement to dry completely. This may take several minutes or longer, depending on the amount of glue applied and the humidity of the surrounding air.
> 
> Note: Rubber cement is a flammable substance and should be used in a well-ventilated area. Avoid inhaling the fumes and keep it away from open flames.
**user**:
> If I leave the rubber cement to dry on only one surface, what happens?
**assistant**:
> If you leave rubber cement to dry on only one surface, the adhesive properties of the glue will not be activated. When rubber cement is applied, it forms a tacky, sticky surface on both surfaces that are being glued together. This allows the surfaces to bond together and form a strong bond.
> 
> If you only apply rubber cement to one surface and let it dry, the glue will not be activated and the two surfaces will not stick together. The dried rubber cement will remain on the surface and can be easily removed, but it will not provide any adhesive properties.
> 
> Therefore, it is important to apply rubber cement to both surfaces that you want to glue together and allow it to dry before pressing them together. This will activate the adhesive properties of the glue and create a strong bond between the surfaces.

> How do I create a sticky ball or pad with rubber cement?
**assistant**:
> To create a sticky ball or pad with rubber cement, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Pour a small amount of rubber cement onto a non-porous surface, such as a piece of plastic or glass.
> 
> 2. Use a toothpick or similar object to shape the rubber cement into a ball or pad shape. Be sure to shape it to the desired size and thickness.
> 
> 3. Allow the rubber cement to dry completely. This will take several minutes, depending on the amount of glue used and the humidity of the surrounding air.
> 
> 4. Once the rubber cement is dry, it should be tacky and sticky to the touch. You can now use the sticky ball or pad to pick up small objects, such as paper clips, or to temporarily adhere objects to surfaces, such as posters to walls.
> 
> Note: Rubber cement can be messy and difficult to work with, so be sure to protect your work surface and work in a well-ventilated area. Additionally, be sure to follow any safety instructions provided by the manufacturer of the rubber cement.
