> How can I use the concept of expenditure share in an MRIO matrix to calculate how losses in country i will affect country j?
**assistant**:
> The concept of expenditure share in a Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) model is essential in understanding how losses in one country (country i) propagate to affect another country (country j). Let's use the principle of expenditure share in this context.
> 
> 1. Construct Expenditure Share Matrix:
>     - The first step in the process is to obtain or construct the expenditure share matrix. Assume that you have an MRIO table for t time periods, consisting of an inter-industry transaction matrix Z (of dimension n*n where n is total number of regions*sectors), a final demand column vector y (of dimension n*1) and a total output row vector x (1*n). Expenditure share matrix E can be calculated by E = Z / x, where division is conducted column-wise. This gives each country's industry-wise share in the total output from every other country's industry.
> 
> 2. Use Expenditure Shares to Help Understand Propagation:
>    - When losses occur in country i, the Expenditure Share matrix E can help trace how these losses can propagate to other counties. Let's denote losses in output of a sector in country i as Δx_i. This loss will decrease the outputs of sectors in other countries proportionally to their expenditure shares. For example, the loss in output for a sector in country j due to the losses in country i is Δx_j = e_ji * Δx_i, where e_ji is the expenditure share of country i's sector in country j's sector.
> 
> 3. Aggregate effects:
>     - To obtain the total effect, you can multiply the loss in initial output by the Leontief Inverse I-A^-1. I-A is the matrix of technic coefficients, with I being the identity matrix and A being the direct requirement (input) matrix calculated by A = Z/diag(x) (division of a column of Z by corresponding total output element). The element a_ij of A denotes the direct input from sector j needed to produce one unit of output in sector i.

> By combining the understanding of expenditure shares with MRIO modelling paradigms such as the Leontief model, it's possible to measure the impacts of shocks in one region on another. This is a complex process often with strong assumptions, and must be done with consideration to these factors.

> Remember, the MRIO model is a representational tool and doesn't capture all the complexities of real economic systems. Always corroborate any findings from the model with empirical observations when possible.

> It sounds like I can use the relationship x = L f, where L = (I - A)^-1, to calculate total losses. But that would be total losses to gross output. How can I calculate resulting total losses to GDP?
**assistant**:
> To calculate the resulting total losses to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the initial shock in country i in a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) context, you can indeed use the Leontief Inverse matrix (L = (I - A)^-1) to determine the impact on GDP. The relationship you mentioned, x = Lf, connects the total output (x) to the final demand vector (f) in an Input-Output framework. Here's how you can proceed to calculate the total losses to GDP:
> 
> 1. Calculate the Initial GDP:
>    - Start by computing the initial GDP for each country. GDP is usually calculated as the sum of value added across all sectors within a country. You can obtain the value added vector v by multiplying the total output vector x with the value added coefficient matrix V, where V = diag(v1, v2, ..., vn) and v_i represents the value added share for each sector.
>      GDP_initial = v'x
> 
> 2. Determine the Impact on Value Added (VA):
>    - Next, use the Leontief Inverse matrix L to determine the change in total output due to the shock (Δx). The change in value added (Δv) can be calculated by multiplying L with the change in total output: Δv = Lv.
> 
> 3. Calculate the Final GDP:
>    - Once you have the change in value added (Δv), you can update the initial GDP to obtain the final GDP after the shock:
>      GDP_final = (v + Δv)'(x - Δx)
> 
> By following these steps, you can estimate the total losses to Gross Domestic Product resulting from the initial shock in country i in an MRIO framework. This approach considers the changes in total output, value added, and final demand to assess the impact on GDP. Remember that this method simplifies a complex economic system and may involve assumptions and limitations inherent in MRIO modeling. Be mindful of these factors when interpreting the results.
