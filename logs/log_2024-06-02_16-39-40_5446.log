> But the timeout error doesn't work properly, because `as_completed` uses a global timeout-- so it doesn't impose it on the individual futures-- and that timeout gets thrown by as_completed-- so the try-execpt doesn't catch it.

> Importantly, the different threads are-- I believe-- getting started at different times, so if futures.concurrent doesn't have a simple option to do what I want, I think I need to have each worker record its start-time, and then check as that time gets used up. Or is there another way?
**assistant**:
> Your understanding is correctâ€”`concurrent.futures.as_completed()` uses a global timeout for the whole future collection, not individual timeouts for each future. To impose a timeout on each feed individually, you can use the `future.result(timeout=10)` method, which allows you to specify an individual timeout for each future. This should be done in a way that doesn't interfere with the overall processing loop.

**user**:
> Okay, this seems reasonable, but now I'm getting some of the results in serial. So, for example, if I have two feeds that are both stalling, I'll want 10 seconds for the first one, then again 10 seconds for the second one, even though the second one has been running for 10 seconds already.
**assistant**:
> To address the issue where results are coming in serially due to timeouts being enforced sequentially, you can take a different approach to handle timeouts individually for each feed in a more concurrent manner. One possible solution is to use the `concurrent.futures.wait()` function with a timeout for each individual future, allowing you to check multiple futures concurrently rather than sequentially.

> In this modified version:

> - The `done` set contains the futures that have completed or timed out during each iteration, allowing you to handle multiple futures concurrently.

**assistant**:
> Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. In your specific case where you want to impose a 10-second timeout on each individual feed, there should be no need for any of the futures to timeout after 10 seconds if all feeds are functioning correctly within that time frame. 
> 
> The purpose of the timeout in your scenario is to ensure that if a feed takes longer than 10 seconds to complete, it will be canceled and not block the entire process indefinitely. As long as all feeds are completing within the 10-second timeframe, there should not be any timeouts or cancellations occurring.
> 
> If you are observing timeouts happening even when the feeds are completing within 10 seconds, it might be worth investigating further to see if there are other factors causing delays in your system. The implementation provided should allow each individual feed to complete within the specified timeout without unnecessary cancellations.
**user**:
> I meant: what is imposing the futures to timeout after 10 seconds? It looks like the while loop will just repeat indefinitely, however long they take.
**assistant**:
> You are correct. In the current implementation, the futures will not timeout after 10 seconds as there is no mechanism in place to force a timeout on them individually after a specific duration.
> 
> If you want to enforce a 10-second timeout for each individual future, you'll need to modify the code to include a mechanism that tracks the start time of each future and cancels it if it exceeds the specified timeout duration. You can achieve this by incorporating a timer for each future.

> In this revised implementation:
> - The `futures` dictionary now includes a tuple of each collector and its start time.
> - The `elapsed_time` calculates how long each future has been running.
> - The `timeout` variable calculates the remaining time until the 10-second mark for each future.
> - The `future.result(timeout=timeout)` call enforces the individual timeouts for each future based on the remaining time.
> 
> This modification should ensure that each individual future is canceled if it takes longer than 10 seconds to complete, even if others have already finished.
