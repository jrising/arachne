These features go beyond efficiency and emissions reduction metrics and into more values-based territory. Our climate actions need elements of accountability; measures like increased fees for large GHG emitters and frontline communities owning funding decisions. They also need to have authentic buy-in and be flexible enough to adapt to leadership changes, legal challenges and climate change itself.

> Accountability, authenticity, and adaptability are major drivers of IMT’s work. I’d like to spotlight two efforts our team is working on right now that really demonstrate those values. First, our new research shows how we raise adequate funding for equitable climate action in Minnesota through utility interventions and pollution registration. 
> 
> Second, our Community Climate Shift initiative continues to build momentum and deepen collaborations that support place-based climate solutions. Last week our team met in San Francisco with our collaborators from more than a dozen locations across the country. We heard about the progress all of our community partners are making, and toured several projects with our Bay Area hosts, PODER SF and Emerald Cities Collaborative: a residential electrification pilot, the Bicis Del Pueblo community-based bike program, and the beautiful Hummingbird Farm. We also spent time focused on story sharing and collective problem solving, and closed with a deep dive on effective use of the Spectrum for Community Engagement to Ownership with Rosa Gonzalez from Facilitating Power. Our team came away from the convening feeling energized about the work that’s happening in San Franciso, and across the places represented by all of our Community Climate Shift partners.

> Effective climate solutions require accountability, authenticity, and adaptability, extending beyond simple efficiency metrics. At IMT, we're demonstrating these principles with two initiatives. 
> 
> Firstly, our research outlines funding methods for equitable climate action in Minnesota, focusing on utility interventions and pollution registration. 
> 
> Secondly, the Community Climate Shift initiative establishes partnerships that foster place-based climate solutions. In a recent San Francisco meeting with collaborators nationwide, we reviewed progress, toured local projects, and discussed collective problem-solving and effective community engagement. We left energized about ongoing work both in San Francisco and other represented locations.

> Let's work together to devise solutions embodying our values.
