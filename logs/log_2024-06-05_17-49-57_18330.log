> I'm trying to match up some tax data from the IMPLAN model against data that I was given by a county. The county has information on the following:
>  - Realty Transfer Tax (to county + municipalities)
>  - Building Permits (to county + municipalities)
>  - Fire Fees (to special districts)
>  - Property Tax (to state, special districts, county, and municipalities)
> 
> While IMPLAN has data for (excluding federal-only items):
>  - Dividends (to fed and state + local)
>  - OPI: Corporate Profits Tax (to fed and state + local)
>  - Personal Tax: Income Tax (to fed and state + local)
>  - Personal Tax: NonTaxes (Fines- Fees) (to fed and state + local)
>  - Personal Tax: Motor Vehicle License (to state + local)
>  - Personal Tax: Other Tax (Fish/Hunt) (to state + local)
>  - TOPI: Motor Vehicle License (to state + local)
>  - TOPI: Other Taxes (to state + local)
>  - TOPI: Property Tax (to state + local)
>  - TOPI: Sales Tax (to state + local)
>  - TOPI: Special Assessments (to state + local)

> I need to match up the data from the county to the data from IMPLAN, where possible, and figure out if there are any cases where I should assume that the county has other streams of money (though it claims that it does not), because they're in IMPLAN.
> 
> Can you help me do this?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, James! Here's how you might match up the tax data from the county with IMPLAN, along with some guidance on whether additional streams should be considered:
> 
> ### Matching County Data to IMPLAN Data
> 
> 1. **Realty Transfer Tax**
>    - **County:** Realty Transfer Tax (to county + municipalities)
>    - **IMPLAN:** This tax doesn't directly correspond to a specific item in IMPLAN. However, it might be aggregated under **TOPI: Other Taxes (to state + local)** or could be part of **TOPI: Property Tax (to state + local)** depending on how IMPLAN groups different tax types.
> 
> 2. **Building Permits**
>    - **County:** Building Permits (to county + municipalities)
>    - **IMPLAN:** Building permits might be considered as **Personal Tax: NonTaxes (Fines- Fees) (to fed and state + local)** since they are fees rather than traditional taxes.
> 
> 3. **Fire Fees**
>    - **County:** Fire Fees (to special districts)
>    - **IMPLAN:** **TOPI: Special Assessments (to state + local)** might include such special fees for services like fire protection. Fire fees could also potentially fall under **Personal Tax: NonTaxes (Fines- Fees) (to fed and state + local)**.
> 
> 4. **Property Tax**
>    - **County:** Property Tax (to state, special districts, county, and municipalities)
>    - **IMPLAN:** **TOPI: Property Tax (to state + local)** aligns directly with property tax.
> 
> ### Assumptions and Other Considerations
> 
> 1. **Dividends**
>    - IMPLAN includes dividends as a tax category, but if the county hasn't listed any such income stream, it likely doesn't consider them a notable source or the specific data might be excluded from the scope you're looking at.
> 
> 2. **Corporate Profits Tax**
>    - IMPLAN's **OPI: Corporate Profits Tax** might not be directly acknowledged in the county data but can be a part of broader state tax collections flowing to local governments.
> 
> 3. **Personal Taxes (Income, Motor Vehicle License, Fish/Hunt, Fines- Fees)**
>    - These are personal obligations and may be grouped broadly under personal income or other specific taxes in the county's records. Double-check if these personal taxes are included in county budget reports under general revenues.
> 
> 4. **Sales Tax**
>    - Sales tax should ideally show up separately in a comprehensive county revenue list. If your county data doesn’t explicitly list sales tax, verify whether the county actually levies such a tax or if it's collected only by the state and a share is remitted.
> 
> ### Recommendations for Moving Forward
> 
> 1. **Clarify with the County:**
>    - Identify explicitly whether there are other smaller streams or categorical differences between the county’s methodology and IMPLAN's grouping.
>   
> 2. **Mapping Non-Matching Items:**
>    - For taxes that don't neatly fit into IMPLAN categories, estimate their contribution under a likely miscellaneous category like "Other Taxes."
> 
> 3. **Special Cases and Reviews:**
>    - For special fees like fire fees, consult the county's detailed budget documents or financial statements to confirm their categorization and ensure they’re reflected accurately.
> 
> Let me know if you need additional clarification on any point or further assistance with this analysis!
**user**:
> This county is within Delaware, which I think has no sales tax. Should I just drop that?
**assistant**:
> Yes, James, that's correct. Delaware is one of the few states in the United States that does not have a state-level sales tax. Therefore, if the county you are analyzing is in Delaware, you can safely drop the consideration of sales tax from your comparison between the county data and the IMPLAN model.
> 
> If the county doesn't levy its own sales tax (which would be unusual in a state without a state sales tax), then you can confidently exclude sales tax from your analysis. 
> 
> Feel free to proceed with your data matching process without including sales tax in the comparison. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
