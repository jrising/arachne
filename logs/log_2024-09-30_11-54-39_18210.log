> I would like to set up a survey for prospective students to our marine policy programs at UD. Ideally, this would have several features:
>  - It would ask different questions depending on the answers to previous questions-- so it would be in stages rather than just one page of survey questions.
>  - It could take file uploads.
>  - It could send an email upon competition, with different recipients based on the questions.

**assistant**:
> Setting up a feature-rich survey like the one you described can be accomplished using several tools that support conditional logic, file uploads, and automated emails. Here is a step-by-step guide using a few popular platforms:
> 
> ### Option 1: Google Forms with Add-ons
> 1. **Create a Google Form**: Start by creating a form in Google Forms which offers a simple but powerful interface.
>    
> 2. **Add Sections for Stages**: Use the "Sections" feature to break the form into different parts. This way, you can use the "Go to section based on answer" function to guide respondents through different paths.
> 
> 3. **Enable File Uploads**: Add a "File Upload" question type which allows respondents to upload documents. Note that this requires them to have a Google account.
> 
> 4. **Use Add-ons for Email Notifications**: Install the "Form Notifications" or "Yet Another Mail Merge" add-on to send emails upon completion. These can help customize notifications based on responses.
> 
> ### Option 2: Microsoft Forms and Power Automate
> 1. **Create Your Form in Microsoft Forms**: Design the form with sections and branching logic to direct users through different questions based on their answers.
> 
> 2. **File Upload**: Microsoft Forms also supports file upload features, and users need to be within the organization's tenant unless configured otherwise.
> 
> 3. **Automate Email Notifications with Power Automate**: Set up a flow in Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) to trigger email notifications to specific recipients based on form responses.
> 
> ### Option 3: SurveyMonkey or Typeform
> 1. **Conditional Logic**: Both SurveyMonkey and Typeform support advanced conditional logic to customize the survey flow based on answers.
> 
> 2. **File Uploads**: Check if your subscription plan includes file uploads, as this might be available only on higher-tier plans.
> 
> 3. **Automated Emails**: Use their integration capabilities with mailing services or Zapier to set up workflows that send emails to specific recipients based on the answers provided.
> 
> ### Further Considerations
> - **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensure that you comply with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR, when handling personal information and file uploads.
> - **Customization and Flexibility**: While Google Forms is free and highly accessible, platforms like Typeform offer greater aesthetic and customization options, which might be important for branding.
> - **Cost**: If opting for SurveyMonkey or Typeform, be mindful of the cost as complex surveys with integrations might require a premium subscription.
> 
> Once you've chosen a platform, you can further connect it with a CRM or data management system for ongoing tracking and follow-up with prospective students. Let me know if you’d like more detailed guidance on setting up any particular part of this process!
**user**:
> It sounds like both Google and Microsoft would be free. How should I decide between these?
**assistant**:
> Choosing between Google Forms and Microsoft Forms largely depends on your specific needs and context. Here are some factors to consider:
> 
> ### 1. **User Familiarity**
>    - **Google Forms**: If you and your team are already using Google Workspace (e.g., Google Drive, Docs, Sheets), Google Forms may feel more seamless and integrated.
>    - **Microsoft Forms**: If your organization uses Microsoft 365, this can provide a familiar environment for creating and managing forms.
> 
> ### 2. **Features and Flexibility**
>    - **Conditional Logic**:
>      - Both tools support conditional logic, but Google Forms is generally considered more straightforward in setting up branching options.
>    - **File Uploads**:
>      - Both allow file uploads, but Microsoft Forms may give you more control over the file types allowed.
>    - **Custom Themes**:
>      - Google Forms allows some customization with themes but is relatively basic. Microsoft Forms has more advanced design options.
> 
> ### 3. **Integration Capabilities**
>    - **Google Forms**: Integrates effortlessly with Google Sheets, making it easy to analyze data. You can also connect to various third-party tools through Zapier or other automation platforms.
>    - **Microsoft Forms**: Has strong integration with Microsoft Power Automate, which allows for powerful automated workflows for notifications and data management.
> 
> ### 4. **Email Notifications**
>    - **Google Forms**: Requires add-ons to set up customized email notifications effectively.
>    - **Microsoft Forms**: You can create flows in Power Automate to send conditional emails based on responses, which might provide more flexibility.
> 
> ### 5. **Data Presentation**
>    - **Google Forms**: Data automatically collated in Google Sheets can offer straightforward analysis options.
>    - **Microsoft Forms**: Offers built-in analytics, but for a deep dive, you may still need to export to Excel.
> 
> ### 6. **Collaboration**
>    - **Google Forms**: Generally stronger for collaboration, as sharing and editing is straightforward, especially if multiple users need to collaborate on question design.
>    - **Microsoft Forms**: Also collaborative but may require more setup if sharing is needed outside your organization.
> 
> ### 7. **Support and Resources**
>    - Both platforms have extensive support documentation and community forums. If ongoing support and resources are a consideration, check specific features or tools unique to the platform you're most familiar with.
> 
> ### Summary
> - **Choose Google Forms** if you prioritize ease of use, straightforward integration with Google Sheets, and well-supported collaboration features.
> - **Choose Microsoft Forms** if you're already working within the Microsoft ecosystem, need advanced workflows, or require more customization options.
> 
> If possible, you might want to create a quick prototype in both to see which interface feels more intuitive and meets your needs better. Let me know if you have any questions or would like help with specific features in either platform!

**assistant**:
> Setting up the "Go to section based on answer" feature in Google Forms is relatively straightforward. Here’s how to do it step by step:
> 
> ### Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Conditional Logic in Google Forms
> 
> 1. **Create a New Form**:
>    - Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com).
>    - Click on the **Blank** option to start a new form or select an existing one.
> 
> 2. **Add Sections**:
>    - To add different sections, click on the **Add section** icon (two horizontal lines) in the toolbar on the right. This will create a new section for your questions.
>    - You can add as many sections as you need for your survey.
> 
> 3. **Create the First Question**:
>    - In the first section, create a multiple-choice question or a drop-down question that you want to use for branching.
>    - For example: “What type of marine policy are you interested in?” with options like “Conservation,” “Fisheries Management,” and “Climate Change.”
> 
> 4. **Enable Section Navigation**:
>    - Click on the question you just created to highlight it.
>    - Look for the three vertical dots (More options) in the bottom right corner of the question and click it.

> 
> 5. **Link Responses to Sections**:
>    - After selecting "Go to section based on answer," you will see dropdowns next to each answer choice.
>    - Link each answer to the corresponding section. For example:
>      - "Conservation" → **Section 2 (Conservation Questions)**
>      - "Fisheries Management" → **Section 3 (Fisheries Questions)**
>      - "Climate Change” → **Section 4 (Climate Change Questions)**
> 
> 6. **Finish Each Section**:
>    - At the end of each section, you will need to decide where the respondents go after completing the questions in that section.
>    - Use the **Continue to next section** option or link it back to specific sections if needed.
> 
> 7. **Preview Your Form**:
>    - To see how the conditional logic works, click the **eye icon** (Preview) at the top right corner of the form.
>    - Test different responses to ensure the form navigates to the appropriate sections.
