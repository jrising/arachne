> How can I track down pictures of a kind of Lutheran dormitory where my (now dead) grandparents met in 1950, which was in Inglewood, CA.
**assistant**:
> I have several potential methods to find pictures of the Lutheran dormitory where your grandparents met in Inglewood, CA. However, as an AI, I can't do these directly, but I can guide you on how to proceed:
> 
> 1. **Historical Societies**: Contact local or regional historical societies/city libraries, or perhaps a statewide California historical society. They often have broad archives of photographs and documents, and they may be able to help you out. 
> 
>      - Inglewood Public Library - History Room Division: This specific division of the library maintains historical archives that include photographs, which may contain what you're looking for.
> 
>      - Historical Society of Centinela Valley: This society focuses on the history of Inglewood and the Centinela Valley, so it may have relevant documents.
> 
> 2. **University Archives**: If the dormitory was affiliated with a University, the respective University's archives and special collections could hold photographs. The Lutheran church runs several universities, so you may need to check a few.
> 
> 3. **Church Archives**: Contact Lutheran church archives in the area or on a national level. Given the religious nature of the dormitory, there's a good chance they might have some records/photos.
> 
>      - Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Archives: This is the national archive for the Lutheran church in America and might have records or photographs of the dormitory.
> 
> 4. **Online Archives**: Websites like ancestry.com or the digital public library of America (dp.la) have extensive photo archives. You can also try Archives.com and WorldCat.org.
> 
> 5. **Crowd-Sourcing**: Reach out to the wider public through crowd-sourcing. Sites like historypin.org allow users to upload historical photographs to the map, which you can sort by area and time period. Social media platforms (like Facebook groups centered around Inglewood history) can be surprisingly helpful.
> 
> 6. **Online Newspaper Archives**: There are several online newspaper archives (like the California Digital Newspaper Collection) that may have covered stories in that time and taken pictures.
> 
> In your communications for method 1-3, clearly mention the specifics: name of the dormitory if known, the approximate period, the fact that it was a Lutheran setup, and location details. If possible, attach a written note from a relative recalling the place to engage the reader. Good luck with your exciting historical hunt!
