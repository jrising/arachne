> I am Chamanthi, a Sri Lankan girl currently working as a graduate teaching assistant (demonstrator) at Uva Wellassa University of Sri Lanka after completing BSc (Hons) in Aquatic Resources Technology with a Second class upper division (GPA of 3.59/4.00) at the same University. I have two publications and research experience in marine ecology, Oceanography, Aquaculture, genetics, water quality, and fisheries management.
> 
>  
> 
> In my undergraduate period, I conducted my final year research project on the â€œLivelihood status of the fishing community of Mahakanadarawa reservoir in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka". While conducting this research, I found out the livelihood of the fishery community under social, human, physical, natural, and financial capitals. I found the length-weight relationship of Oreochromis niloticus along with its condition factor.

> I have been a part of research on the operation of a coal-fired power plant and its impact on adjoining marine environments and groundwater chemistry, with special reference to heavy metals. In this study, I focused on the power generation process, heavy metal analysis, and social and environmental impacts of the coal-fired power plant.
> 
>  
> 
> As a self-driven researcher, I possess a deep passion for furthering my studies in the realm of marine science, focusing on marine biology and marine ecology with a solid background in ecotoxicology, oceanography, and marine conservation applications in environmental science. As such, I would be incredibly glad if you could kindly offer me a position as a PhD/MSc researcher in your research group, allowing me to expand my knowledge in this subject while also contributing to the work done at the University of Delaware.

**assistant**:
> After reviewing Chamanthi's email, it seems she has undertaken a lot of work in marine science, specifically in the areas of marine biology, marine ecology, and ecotoxicology. However, there seems to be an absence of a distinct focus on economics or policy, possibly indicating that she may be better suited for a natural science program. 
> 
> Specifically mentioning her interest in "marine biology and marine ecology with a solid background in ecotoxicology, oceanography, and marine conservation," points to Chamanthi's strong inclination towards the scientific aspect of marine study. Hence, she might be more interested in the natural science programs offered by the School of Marine Science & Policy.
> 
> Her mention of a 'PhD/MSc researcher' position suggests a bit of ambiguity in her preference between a Ph.D. and masters program, thus, clarification might be helpful.
> 
> Finally, Chamanthi does not appear to be local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, nor does her background information suggest she has done schoolwork at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD.
> 
> Here is an initial drafted response based on your instructions:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Chamanthi,
> 
> Thank you for expressing your interest in joining the University of Delaware for further studies. Based on your background in Marine Studies, specifically in marine biology, marine ecology, ecotoxicology, and oceanography, I understand you are passionate about marine research.
> 
> You might be well-suited to our scientific programs within Marine Science & Policy, especially ones focusing on Marine biology and ecology. I would recommend direclty contacting Dr. Xinfeng Liang (<xfliang@udel.edu>), who supervises students within our natural science programs. 
> 
> At the same time, given your strong background and university teaching experience, a Ph.D. may be worth considering. However, I should inform you that funding is limited for these programs. If you do choose one of our programs, be sure to mention me in your statement of purpose, particularly if your research interests align with my work on climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
> 
> As a low-barrier next step, you might consider applying to the program of your choice by the end of this calendar year; this would ensure that your application could be considered for any potential funding opportunities.
