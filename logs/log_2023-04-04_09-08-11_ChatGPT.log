> The type of uncertainty that arises from not knowing which world or scenario we are in is often referred to as "Knightian uncertainty" or "true uncertainty." Unlike stochastic uncertainty, which can be quantified through probability distributions, Knightian uncertainty cannot be fully quantified or predicted because it involves events or outcomes that are unknown or unknowable. This type of uncertainty is named after economist Frank Knight, who made a distinction between "risk" and "uncertainty" in his 1921 book "Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit."

> Suppose that I do know how to fully quantify it. There's a 50% chance we are in world A and a 50% chance we are in world B. Is that still Knightian uncertainty, or something else
**assistant**:
> If you have information that allows you to fully quantify the probabilities associated with different possible worlds or scenarios, then it is not Knightian uncertainty. In your example, if you know that there is a 50% chance of being in world A and a 50% chance of being in world B, then you have probabilistic uncertainty, but not Knightian uncertainty. Knightian uncertainty arises when it is impossible to assign probabilities to different outcomes or scenarios because we do not have enough information or because the events are inherently unpredictable.
