> I want to randomly draw for a list of events, where there are different probabilities for each event. The probabilities may not sum to 100%, but I want to treat them that way.
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can easily perform this task using Python's `numpy` library. I'll show you an example. Assume you have a list of events and their corresponding probabilities:
> 
> ```python
> import numpy as np
> 
> events = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
> probabilities = [0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1]
> ```
> 
> In your case, the probabilities don't sum up to 1. So first, you need to normalize the probabilities:
> 
> ```python
> probabilities = np.array(probabilities)
> normalized_probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
> ```
> 
> Now, `normalized_probabilities` gives you the relative probabilities of each event, as if they summed up to 1.
> 
> Here is how you can draw an event according to these probabilities:
> 
> ```python
> drawn_event = np.random.choice(events, p=normalized_probabilities)
> 
> print(drawn_event)
> ```
> 
> Every time you run the `np.random.choice` line, Python will draw a random event from the list, where the chance of drawing each event is given by `normalized_probabilities`.
