> 1. Today's problems come from yesterday's "solutions."
> Once there was a rug merchant who saw that his most beautiful carpet had a large bump in its center. 2 He stepped on the bump to flatten it out-and succeeded. But the bump reappeared in a new spot not far away. He jumped on the bump again, and it disappeared -for a moment, until it emerged once more in a new place. Again and again he jumped, scuffing and mangling the rug in his frustration; until finally he lifted one corner of the carpet and an angry snake
> slithered out. Often we are puzzled by the causes of our problems; when we merely need to look at our own solutions to other problems in the past. A well-established firm may find that this quarter's sales are off sharply. Why? Because the highly successful rebate program last quarter led many customers to buy then rather than now. Or a new manager attacks chronically high inventory costs and "solves" the problem-except that the salesforce is now spending 20 percent more time responding to angry complaints from customers who are still waiting for late shipments, and the rest of its time trying to convince prospective customers that they can have "any color they
> want so long as it's black."
> Police enforcement officials will recognize their own version of this law: arresting narcotics dealers on Thirtieth Street, they find that they have simply transferred the crime center to Fortieth Street. Or even more insidiously, they learn that a new citywide outbreak of 'drug-related crime is the result of federal officials intercepting a large shipment of narcotics-which reduced the drug supply, ~ro~e
> up the price, and caused more crime by addicts desperate to mamtam
> their habit.
> Solutions that merely shift problems from one part of a system to another often go undetected because, unlike the rug merchant,_ thus~ who "solved" the first problem are different from those who mhent
> the new problem.
> 2. The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.
> In George Orwell's Animal Farm, the horse Boxer alwa~s had the same answer to any difficulty: "I will work harder," he said. At firs~, his well-intentioned diligence inspired everyone, but gradually, his hard work began to backfire in subtle ways. The harder he worked, the more work there was to do. What he didn't know was that the pigs who managed the farm were actually manipulating them all for their own profit. Boxer's diligence actually helped to keep_ th~ other animals from seeing what the pigs were doing.3 Systems thmkmg has a name for this phenomenon: "Compensating feedback": when wellintentioned interventions call forth responses from the system that offset the benefits of the intervention. We all know what it feels like to be facing compensating feedback-the harder you push, the
> harder the system pushes back; the more effort you expend trying to improve matters, the more effort seems to be r~quired.
> Examples of compensating feedback are legmn. Many of the b~st intentioned government interventions fall prey to compensating feedback. In the 1960s there were massive programs to build lowincome housing and improve job skills in decrepit inner cities in the United States. Many of these cities were even worse off in the 1970s despite the largesse of government aid. Why? One reason was that low-income people migrated from other cities and from rural areas to those cities with the best aid programs. Eventually, the new housing units became overcrowded and the job training programs were swamped with applicants. All the while, the city's tax base continued to erode, leaving more people trapped in economically depressed areas.
> Similar compensating feedback processes have operated to thwart foo~ and agricultural assistance to developing countries. More food avallabl~. has b~en ''compensated for'' by reduced deaths due to malnutr~t~on, higher net population growth, and eventually more malnutnt10n.
> Similarly, efforts to correct the U.S. trade imbalance by letting the valu~ of the d~llar fall in the mid-1980s were compensated for by foreig~ competitors who let prices of their goods fall in parallel (for co~ntnes whose ~urrency was "pegged to the dollar,'' their prices adJusted aut_omattcally). Efforts by foreign powers to suppress indige~ou~ guerrilla fighters often lead to further legitimacy for the guerrilla~ cause: thereby strengthening their resolve and support, and leadmg to sttll further resistance.
> ~any companies experience compensating feedback when one of their products suddenly starts to lose its attractiveness in the market. They p~sh for more aggressive marketing; that's what always worked m ~he past, isn't it? They spend more on advertising, and ~rop the pnce; these methods may bring customers back temporardy, but they also draw money away from the company, so it cuts corners to con:pe~sate, !he quality of its service (say, its delivery speed or care m mspect1on) starts to decline. In the long run, the more f~rvently the company markets, the more customers it loses.
> Nor is compensating feedback limited to "large systems"-there

> Many apparent dilemmas, such as central versus local control, and happy committed employees versus competitive labor costs, and rewarding individual achievement versus having everyone feel valued are by-products of static thinking. They only appear as rigid "either-or" choices, because we think of what is possible at a fixed point in time. Next month, it may be true that we must choose one or the other, but the real leverage lies in seeing how both can improve over time. 6
> 10. Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants.
> Living systems have integrity. Their character depends on the whole. The same is true for organizations; to understand the most challenging managerial issues requires seeing the whole system that generates the issues.
> Another Sufi tale illustrates the point of this law. As three blind men encountered an elephant, each exclaimed aloud. "It is a large rough thing, wide and broad, like a rug," said the first, grasping an ear. The second, holding the trunk, said, "I have the real facts. It is a straight and hollow pipe." And the third, holding a front leg, said, "It is mighty and firm, like a pillar." Are the three blind men any different from the heads of manufacturing, marketing, and research in many companies? Each sees the firm's problems clearly, but none see how the policies of their department interact with the others. Interestingly, the Sufi story concludes by observing that "Given these men's way of knowing, they will never know an elephant.''

> Can you suggest multiple choice questions for a reading quiz, to check that students did the reading?
> 
**assistant**:
> Sure, here are some multiple-choice questions based on the above text that can help assess students' understanding of the reading:
> 
> 1. According to the reading, today's problems can:
> 
>    a) Almost always be traced back to natural disasters
>    b) Not be linked to anything at all
>    c) Be traced back to yesterday's solutions
>    d) Be fixed with quick, easy solutions
> 
> 2. What does the carpet and snake metaphor used in the text symbolize?
> 
>    a) The unpredictability of life
>    b) The risk in starting a new business
>    c) The tendency to shift problems instead of solving them
>    d) The danger of animal-based products
> 
> 3. According to the story, what often happens when enforcing narcotics laws?
> 
>    a) Dealers move their operations to a different street
>    b) Crime decreases uniformly across the city
>    c) All narcotics dealers are immediately arrested
>    d) The officials always remain on the same street
>    
> 4. "Compensating feedback" in system thinking refers to:
> 
>    a) Paying more attention to feedback
>    b) Reactions from the system that offset interventions
>    c) Making intentional faults to gain feedback
>    d) Overcompensating for a system's errors 
> 
> 5. What does the example of Boxer, the horse from Animal Farm, demonstrate?
> 
>    a) The value of perseverance
>    b) The risk of working too hard
>    c) The possible manipulation of hard workers
>    d) The challenges of farm life
> 
> 6. How does the text describe the apparent dilemmas such as central versus local control?
> 
>    a) As rigid entities that arise due to static thinking 
>    b) As flexible situations specific to each case
>    c) As permanent problems with no proper solution
>    d) As aspects that improve upon experimentation 
> 
> 7. What does the proverb "Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants" represent in context of this reading?
> 
>    a) The importance of sharing resources
>    b) The ineffectiveness of splitting tasks
>    c) The difficulty of making compromises
>    d) The limitation of understanding a system in parts
>

> 
>    a) They cannot see the elephant correctly
>    b) They are unable to understand the entire system they are part of
>    c) They have limited sensory perception
>    d) They each believe that their department is the most important
