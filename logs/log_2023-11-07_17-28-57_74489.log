> ---
> \section{Methodology}
> 
> \subsection{Literature Review}
> 
> The research team identified eight critical papers that have made significant contributions to our understanding of the macroeconomic effects of climate change. These papers span a range of insights, from the differential vulnerability of low-income countries to the potential for adaptation and persistence of growth.
> 
> A total of 61 unique models from these papers were assessed and implemented. Meta-data was collected for each model under 11 distinct headings, representing various aspects of model sophistication and data quality. The dimensions are as follows:
> 
> \begin{itemize}
>     \item Weather aggregation weighting scheme
>     \item Temperature variables representation
>     \item Rainfall variables representation
>     \item Handling of differential vulnerability for poor countries
>     \item Treatment of unobserved heterogeneity by year
>     \item Treatment of nonlinear socioeconomic trends
>     \item Inclusion of additional heterogeneous factors
>     \item Inclusion of additional controls
>     \item Inclusion of lags of economic growth
>     \item Recency of data
>     \item Span of data
> \end{itemize}
> 
> All of these models were estimated using econometric methods with high-quality weather and economic output data.
> 
> For instance, the main model developed by \citet{dell2012temperature} investigates the differential effect of climate change on low-income countries, but only includes linear representations of temperature and total rainfall. In contrast, the models detailed in \citet{kahn2021long}, which incorporates an adaptive local climate optimum, includes linear splines for most of its models but do not include further consideration of trends and temperal heterogeneity.
> 
> The detailed ratings allow us to compare these models more objectively and to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This, in turn, helps to guide the subsequent machine learning-trained model integration and the assessment of current macroeconomic losses from climate change.
> 
> \subsection{Projections}
> 
> The starting point for this analysis is the ERA5 reanalysis weather data available from 1940 to 2022. This dataset provides us with historical weather data, which we aggregate to the country level using the {\tt xagg} library.
> 
> The inherent uncertainty of the model parameters is accounted for by applying Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. For each of the MC simulations, we draw the model parameters from their respective probability distributions. After drawing the model parameters, we simulate our chosen models for every country under two conditions: 
> 
> \begin{itemize}
> \item Actual weather conditions, where we consider only the temperature variables,
> \item A hypothetical scenario where the climate didn't change, achieved by resampling the weather data from the baseline period of 1940 - 1959.
> \end{itemize}
> 
> The difference in economic outcomes under these two conditions represents the immediate impact of climate change on the GDP of a country $i$ in a year $t$, represented as the variable $ImmediateImpact_{it}$. 
> 
> The impacts are then aggregated across time for each country, accounting for the possibility that the impacts of climate change persist over time and potentially put countries onto permanently lower growth trajectories. The aggregation formula is as follows:
> 
> \begin{equation}
> DirectImpact_{it} = \sum_{s \le t} (1 - \phi)^{t - s} ImmediateImpact_{is}
> \end{equation}
> 
> Where $\phi$ represents the rate of recovery from a climate shock. Following the work by \citet{nath2023much}, we set $\phi = 0.25$. 
> We excluded accumulation for the \citet{kotz2022effect} models as they already accounted for it.
> 
> Figure \ref{fig:methproj} shows the global aggregated $DirectImpact_{it}$ values from each included model.
> 
> \subsection{Machine Learning Approach}
> 
> To determine the impact and costs of climate change across nations, we leverage the insights provided by multiple research papers that have investigated the relationship between GDP growth, temperature, precipitation, and other factors. However, rather than taking a simple average of their results, we employ a machine learning approach to integrate their individual contributions, thus forming a single comprehensive model. 
> 
> We proceed in two steps: First, for each instance, we assign quality values to the attributes of the models, ranging from 0 to 1, based on their assessed quality according to the criteria mentioned in the project proposal. A value of 1 corresponds to excellent quality model attribute and a value of 0 corresponds to poor quality modeling decision.
> 
> The detail of each quality-related parameter specification is included in the following table:
> \begin{table}[h!]

> Temperature (Q.Temp) and Precipitation (Q.Prec) & Quadratic, interacted, linear splines, and multiple variable models received a score of 1; Linear representations that included lagged variables got a score of 0.75, and linear representations got a score of 0.5. Other options have a value of 0. \\
> \hline
> Year Fixed Effects (Q.YearFE) & Fixed effects by region are given a value of 1, by continent a value of 0.75, global fixed effects are given a value of 0.5, and a lack of year fixed effects is given a value of 0. \\

> \hline
> Additional Controls (Q.Control) & Inclusion of both lagged weather and disaster variables get 1; inclusion of just lagged weather and the seven controls used by \citet{baarsch2020impact} gets 0.5; 0 for others. \\
> \hline
> Growth Lags (Q.GLags) & The number of growth lags included divided by 4. \\

> \end{table}
> 
> Secondly, these quality values are treated as parameters, upon which a random forest machine learning model is fitted for each country-year-Monte Carlo draw using the DirectImpact values. 
> 
> The query is then made to the random forest model to infer the damages, for situations when all quality parameters are 1, hence indicating optimum conditions based on each attribute. The result is a robust estimate of the potential economic costs of climate change for each country. 
>

> \subsection{International Effects}
> 
> The GDP-temperature literature uses local temperature shocks to estimate empirical relationships driving annual differences in GDPs, and as a result they structurally exclude international spill-over effects. The total market impact on each economy includes the spill-over effects of losses to other economies, as transmitted through international trade.
> 
> We use Brexit CGE studies to calibrate the international effect of impacts operating through the international trade network.

**assistant**:
> **Methodology**
> 
> The methodology for estimating the macroeconomic effects of climate change consists of three main components: a literature review, projections, and a machine learning approach. Each component contributes to understanding the potential economic losses due to climate change.
> 
> The research team conducted a comprehensive literature review and identified eight critical papers that have significantly advanced our understanding of the macroeconomic impacts of climate change. These papers cover a range of insights, including the vulnerability of low-income countries, adaptation potential, and the persistence of economic growth. The team assessed and implemented a total of 61 unique models from these papers.
> 
> To assess the models, meta-data was collected under 11 distinct headings that represent various aspects of model sophistication and data quality. These dimensions include weather aggregation weighting schemes, representation of temperature and rainfall variables, treatment of differential vulnerability for poor countries, handling of unobserved heterogeneity, consideration of nonlinear socioeconomic trends, inclusion of additional factors and controls, and data recency and span.
> 
> All the models were estimated using econometric methods and employed high-quality weather and economic output data. The detailed ratings of these models allowed for an objective comparison and identification of their relative strengths and weaknesses. This information aided the subsequent integration of models using a machine learning approach.
> 
> For projections, the analysis starts with ERA5 reanalysis weather data from 1940 to 2022. Historical weather data is aggregated to the country level. Monte Carlo simulations are applied to account for the inherent uncertainty in model parameters. These simulations draw model parameters from their respective probability distributions. The models are then simulated for each country under two conditions: actual weather conditions and a hypothetical scenario where the climate remains unchanged. The difference in economic outcomes between these conditions represents the immediate impact of climate change on a country's GDP.
> 
> The impacts are aggregated over time for each country, considering the possibility of persistent impacts that lead to permanently lower growth trajectories. The aggregation formula incorporates a recovery rate from climate shocks. The rate of recovery is set to 0.25 based on previous work by Nath et al. (2023). The result is the direct impact of climate change on GDP for each country.
> 
> The machine learning approach integrates the individual contributions of the assessed models to determine the impact and costs of climate change across nations. Each model is assigned quality values for various attributes based on assessed model quality. These quality values range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating excellent quality and 0 indicating poor quality. 
> 
> A random forest machine learning model is then fitted for each country-year-Monte Carlo draw using the direct impact values. This model takes into account the quality values assigned to each attribute. By querying the random forest model with quality values set to 1 for all attributes, the damages of climate change are inferred under optimum conditions for each attribute. This approach provides a robust estimate of potential economic costs for each country.
> 
> The international effects of climate change are addressed by considering the spill-over effects of losses on other economies through international trade. The analysis calibrates these effects using Brexit CGE studies, which provide estimates of losses to GDP, exports, and imports in different Brexit scenarios. The relationship between import and export changes and GDP loss is represented using a regression model based on the observed results of the Brexit studies.
> 
> The analysis also incorporates capital dynamics by developing a model based on the Solow growth model and the Inclusive Wealth capital framework. This model captures produced, human, and renewable capital dynamics for all countries. It uses data on GDP, population, savings rates, agriculture's share of GDP, and capital estimates from the Inclusive Wealth Report. The model includes equations for GDP, capital shares, renewable capital growth, produced capital investment, and human capital growth. Model parameters are calibrated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
> 
> The reporting of results involves calculating the population-weighted median across Monte Carlo draws, along with the interquartile range, to quantify the potential economic losses caused by climate change.
> 
> The methodology is supported by visual presentations of the global aggregated direct impacts and the population-weighted impact from the random forest model. These figures provide a visual summary of the estimated macroeconomic effects and serve as a basis for the final estimation of potential climate-associated economic losses.
> 
> Overall, the methodology encompasses a comprehensive analysis combining literature review, projections, and machine learning techniques to provide a detailed understanding of the potential economic losses resulting from climate change.
**user**:
> Can you propose a section on the limitations of the work here?
**assistant**:
> **Limitations**
> 
> While the methodology employed in this study provides valuable insights into the macroeconomic effects of climate change, there are several limitations that should be acknowledged:
> 
> 1. **Model Selection and Assumptions:** The methodology relies on the selection and implementation of existing economic models. The choice of models and the assumptions made within them introduce inherent uncertainties and potential biases. It is important to recognize that different model specifications and assumptions could yield different results.
> 
> 2. **Data Availability and Quality:** The accuracy and reliability of the results are contingent upon the availability and quality of data used in the models. While efforts were made to utilize high-quality weather and economic output data, there may still be limitations, such as data gaps, measurement errors, or assumptions made to fill in missing data. These factors can affect the robustness of the findings.
> 
> 3. **Simplifications and Generalizations:** Economic models often involve simplifications and generalizations to make the analysis tractable. The methodology employed here may not capture all the complexities and nuances of real-world economic systems and climate impacts. Variables and interactions that are not explicitly included in the models may influence the results.
> 
> 4. **Uncertainty and Future Projections:** The projections of climate change impacts on GDP are subject to uncertainties related to the extent and timing of future climate change, as well as the efficacy of adaptation measures. The chosen recovery rate for climate shocks, while based on previous research, represents a simplification and may not fully capture the variability in recovery dynamics across countries.
> 
> 5. **Scope of Analysis:** The analysis focuses on the macroeconomic effects of climate change and does not consider other important dimensions, such as social, environmental, or equity implications. The potential indirect effects of climate change through non-linear feedback loops or unexpected interactions are not explicitly accounted for in the methodology.
> 
> 6. **International Trade Dynamics:** The methodology incorporates spill-over effects of losses through international trade based on the relationship observed in Brexit CGE studies. While this provides valuable insights, the specific effects and mechanisms of climate-related trade disruptions may vary across different geopolitical contexts and trade networks.
> 
> 7. **Assessment of Quality Parameters:** The assignment of quality values to model attributes in the machine learning approach involves subjective judgments and may not perfectly capture the true quality or relevance of each attribute. The weights assigned to each attribute in the random forest model may influence the aggregate results.
> 
> 8. **Model Validation:** Although efforts have been made to assess and compare the models included in the analysis, comprehensive model validation against real-world

**assistant**:
> data and empirical observations is challenging. The ability of the models to accurately capture the complex dynamics of climate change impacts on the macroeconomy should be further evaluated and validated against independent data sources when available.
> 
> 9. **External Factors and Systemic Interdependencies:** The methodology primarily focuses on climate change as the main driver of macroeconomic effects. However, it is essential to recognize that other external factors, such as technological advancements, policy interventions, or socio-political developments, can significantly influence economic outcomes. The potential interactions and systemic interdependencies between climate change and these external factors are not explicitly accounted for in the analysis.
> 
> 10. **Epistemic Uncertainty:** Despite the best efforts to incorporate available knowledge and data, there are inherent limitations to our understanding of climate change impacts on the macroeconomy. Uncertainties arise from both the complexity of the climate system and the challenges in modeling complex socio-economic processes. It is important to acknowledge the epistemic uncertainties associated with the methodology and the potential for future research to refine and improve our understanding.
> 
> 11. **Regional and Context-Specific Variations:** The methodology provides aggregate estimates at the country level, but variations in climate change impacts can occur at regional, subnational, or local scales. The analysis may not capture location-specific vulnerabilities, adaptation capacities, or regional variations in economic structure that can influence the magnitude and distribution of impacts.
> 
> 12. **Assessment of Non-Market Impacts:** The focus of the analysis is on economic losses measured in terms of GDP. However, climate change can have significant non-market impacts, such as ecological damage, health impacts, or social disruptions, which are not explicitly quantified within this methodology. The omission of these non-market impacts may limit the comprehensiveness of the analysis.
> 
> It is crucial to recognize these limitations and uncertainties when interpreting the results of this study. Integrating multiple methodologies, considering complementary research disciplines, and further validating the models against empirical data can help enhance the accuracy and robustness of future analyses on the macroeconomic effects of climate change.
