> How much does one get for unemployment benefits in Pennsylvania?
**assistant**:
> As of my last update on benefits, in Pennsylvania, the amount you receive in unemployment benefits is determined by your earnings during a base period. This base period is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the week you file an initial claim.
> 
> The maximum weekly benefit rate in Pennsylvania is $572 for an individual without dependents. However, this amount can increase if you have dependents. For one dependent, the maximum is $631; for two dependents, $690; for three or more dependents, $748.
> 
> Keep in mind that your weekly benefit rate would be approximately half of your full-time weekly wage up to the maximum amount. Also, note that these amounts are subject to change, so it's always a good idea to check the current rates on the official website of Pennsylvania's Department of Labor & Industry.
> 
> Unemployment benefits are typically available for up to 26 weeks, but this can be extended during times of high unemployment.
> 
> As this is a fast-changing subject especially due to COVID-19, I recommend validating these figures from the official sources, as these information can get outdated quickly.
