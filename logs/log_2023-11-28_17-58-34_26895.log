**user**:
> Can I use a GPL-licensed library in a tool that I have built and then sell consulting services using that tool?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use a GPL-licensed library in the tool you have built and then sell consulting services using that tool. 
> 
> The GPL (General Public License) does not restrict selling software, services either, or even using the software for private commercial activities; it only concerns the terms for distributing the software.
> 
> GPL, often referred to as "copyleft," is meant to ensure that the software and its derivatives always remain open-source. Here's what you must do:
> 
> 1. Include the original authors' copyright notices and disclaimers.
> 2. Accompany the product with the source code (or with an offer to provide source code).
> 3. Pass on the GPL freedoms. It means any versions of the product that you distribute (or the tool you created) must be licensed under the GPL.
> 
> However, in your case where consulting services involve using the tool and not distributing it, GPL restrictions directly might not apply.
> 
> Still, you should read the terms and conditions of the specific license carefully and consider seeking legal advice before proceeding to make sure you are in full compliance. 
> 
> Please remember that this advice is provided based on my knowledge of GPL and general open-source licenses and is not intended to replace formal legal advice.
