> Is vertically integrated ozone concentration ("total column ozone") a decent proxy for ozone exposure at ground-level?
**assistant**:
> Total column ozone (TCO) refers to the total amount of ozone present in a column of the atmosphere from the surface to the edge of space, measured in Dobson Units. While it is a useful measure for understanding the overall ozone concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, it does not directly reflect ozone exposure at ground level.
> 
> Ground-level ozone, also known as tropospheric ozone, is the primary concern for human health and environmental impacts. It forms close to the surface as a result of chemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) under sunlight. The concentration of ground-level ozone is influenced by local sources of pollution, weather conditions, and geographic factors, which can vary significantly from what is observed in the total column ozone.

> Therefore, using TCO as a proxy for ground-level ozone exposure can be misleading. Ground-level ozone concentrations need to be measured more directly, often using ground-based monitoring stations, to accurately assess exposure risks to human health and the environment. If you're interested in evaluating ozone exposure, it's more reliable to look at specific tropospheric ozone data rather than relying on total column values.
