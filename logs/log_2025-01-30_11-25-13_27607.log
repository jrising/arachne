> 
> Dear Bornali,
> 
> Thank you for your thoughtful emails and your clear dedication to pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics with us.
> 
> Unfortunately, as I mentioned, I do not have funding available for new students this year. Regarding your request to waive the tuition fees, that decision typically lies with the admissions or financial aid office, and it is rare to secure such waivers without a broader institutional policy.
> 
> However, I encourage you to explore external funding opportunities, such as international scholarships or fellowships offered by organizations that focus on supporting students from India or specifically from West Bengal. Some potential options might include:
> 
> 1. **Commonwealth Scholarship** - Available for students from developing Commonwealth countries pursuing study in the UK, but sometimes applicable for positions elsewhere.
> 2. **Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation Scholarships** - Offers scholarships for Indian students to pursue higher education at top institutions abroad.
> 3. **Fulbright-Nehru Program** - Offers opportunities for Indian students to study in the United States.
> 
> Moreover, you may wish to contact the university's financial aid office to inquire about any assistance or opportunities they may be aware of.
> 
> If you would like to discuss this further, feel free to schedule a meeting at your convenience through this link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).
> 
> Thank you again, and I wish you the best in finding funding to support your academic pursuits.
