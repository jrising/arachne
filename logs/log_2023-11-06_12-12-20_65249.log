> How can I make the amount of emissions of 1 GtCO2 intuitive?
**assistant**:
> Making a conceptual abstraction like 1 gigatonne of CO2 (1 billion metric tons) seem intuitive can be quite daunting because of the immense scale. However, here are few analogies which may aid in understanding.
> 
> 1. **Visual Comparison:** 1 GtCO2 is roughly equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 196 million passenger cars driven for one year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That's many times more than the total number of cars in New York City.
> 
> 2. **Volume Comparison:** One metric ton of CO2 roughly takes up a space of 556.2 cubic meters (a cube with about 8.2 meters on each side). Therefore, 1 GtCO2 would occupy a cube with about 8.2 kilometers on each side, that's larger than Mount Everest and close to the height aircraft fly at cruising altitude. 
> 
> 3. **Contextual Comparison:** According to the Global Carbon Project, global CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels and industry reached 36.4 GtCO2 in 2019. So 1 GtCO2 is roughly 2.75% of this annual global total.
> 
> These comparisons can help make the enormous scale of 1 GtCO2 more understandable through comparisons to other large structures or familiar concepts.
