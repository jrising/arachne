> My wife just got fired from her job. She has been offered a 6-week severance, but is considering legal action as a wrongful termination. What are the criteria for that case to be successful?
**assistant**:
> I'm sorry to hear about your wife's situation, James. In general, for a wrongful termination case to be successful, several conditions usually need to be met. Here are the basic criteria:
> 
> 1. **Employment Contract Violation**: If your wife had a contractual agreement with her employer and the terms of the contract were violated, she might have a legitimate wrongful termination case.
> 
> 2. **Unlawful Termination**: If the termination was due to illegal reasons, such as discrimination based on race, religion, sex, nationality, age, pregnancy, or disability, or in retaliation for reporting illegal activity, then the case has much merit.
> 
> 3. **Public Policy Violation**: If the dismissal contravened an established public policy. For example, she was fired because she exercised a legal right (like taking time off work to vote or serve on a jury), she could potentially file for wrongful dismissal.
>    
> 4. **Constructive Dismissal**: If your wife was forced to resign because the employer made her working conditions intolerable, such as by harassing or demoting her without reason, it can also be considered wrongful dismissal.
> 
> 5. **Implied Promise**: An employer implied that the employee had long term job security and then abruptly fired them without good cause.
> 
> However, it's worth noting that laws vary in different states and jurisdictions. It would be advisable to consult with an attorney specializing in this area of law to understand the best way forward considering the specific circumstances and local laws.
> 
> Keep in mind, litigation can be a time-consuming and sometimes expensive process. She might consider counter-balancing the potential benefits of legal action with its cost, the length of proceedings, possible emotional stress, and potential reputation impact in her industry.
