> No, long-tailed distributions and fat-tailed distributions do not necessarily have undefined (infinite) means. Whether the mean is finite or infinite depends on the specific nature of the distribution and its parameters.

> A long-tailed distribution is simply one in which the tail of the distribution does not decay rapidly - that is, there is a non-negligible chance of very large values. Similarly, a fat-tailed distribution refers to a probability distribution that exhibits heavy tails or kurtosis, meaning it has higher than normal probabilities for extreme outcomes.

> - A Pareto distribution, a common example of a long-tailed and fat-tailed distribution, has a parameter known as the shape parameter. If the shape parameter (denoted usually as "α") is greater than 1, the mean of the Pareto distribution is finite. If α ≤ 1, the mean is infinite.

For example, in the Pareto distribution, the variance is only finite if α > 2. Similarly, higher moments may or may not exist depending on the parameters of the distribution. Hence, both the specific form of the distribution and its parameters are crucial in determining which moments are finite.
