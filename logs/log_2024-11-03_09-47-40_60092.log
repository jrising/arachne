> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope you are having a great day. I am writing to introduce myself and let you know I am interested in your research lab. I graduated from the Department of Zoology at Jagannath University (JnU) in May 2024 with a major in Zoology. I intend to apply for my graduate studies in the Fall of '25. 
> 
> I am very interested in your research on modeling social-environmental systems and assessing climate change impacts on fisheries and resource management. Through my work in sustainable aquaculture and conservation, I’ve developed an understanding of how climate shifts influence fisheries and community practices. My projects, such as optimizing stocking densities and studying local fisheries, have focused on practical resource management under changing environmental pressures. I am especially drawn to the opportunity to explore integrated modeling approaches in your lab and would be thrilled to contribute to your team.
> 
> I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect with you briefly to discuss your research work and answer any questions you may have. Please let me know if you are available for a brief call or email exchange at your convenience. I am listing my profile below; I've also attached my resume and academic transcript for your review.

> I worked as a research assistant on a project on “Impact of Stocking Densities on Survivability and Growth Performance of Crablet at Nursing in Hapa Stage” aimed to optimize the stocking densities and pond habitats for better survival, intactness, and growth of orange mud crab juveniles by regular monitoring of water quality parameters (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, and total ammonia), which is currently awaiting publication.
> 
> In my undergraduate term paper, I worked on “Prospects and Problems of Soft-shell Crab Farming in the Southwest Region of Bangladesh” where we (our team) traveled to a coastal region (Satkhira) to explore the possibilities and difficulties of soft-shell crab farming in the Southwest part of Bangladesh as well as the socioeconomic and ecological conditions by interviewing the farmers and key stakeholders.
> 
> Besides, I also worked on “A study on Sharks and Rays in Dhaka City’s Fish Market”. I visited various fish markets in Dhaka to identify the species of sharks and rays being trafficked, evaluate their market prices, understand the factors driving the demand for their meat, and assess their conservation status (IUCN status).
