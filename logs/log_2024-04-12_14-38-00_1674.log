**user**:
> In R, I'm using read.delim to read a TSV file (with header=F-- the file just has numbers), and then converting it to a matrix with as.matrix. Is there a more efficient way to just read this as a matrix to start with?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is a more direct way to read a file into a matrix in R using the `scan` function, which is a lower-level function for reading data and can be quite fast. Here's a small example:
> 
> ```r
> # Read into a vector
> vec = scan("file.tsv", what = numeric(0), quiet = TRUE)
> 
> # Reshape into a matrix
> mat = matrix(vec, nrow = 10)  # Replace 10 with the actual number of rows
> 
> # transpose the matrix if you need to
> mat = t(mat)
> ```
> 
> The `scan` function can be faster than `read.delim` especially for large files, and it reads the data directly into a vector, which can then be reshaped into a matrix with the `matrix` function. Please replace `10` with the actual number of rows in the file.
> 
> Please note!
> 
> The matrix function by default fill column-wise. If you want to fill row-wise, you would need to transpose it using `t(mat)`.
> 
> If you have missing values in your TSV file, `scan` will give `NA` for those positions. 
> 
> Please beware, while this can be faster, it may be more prone to errors if files are not perfectly formatted or have irregularities, as scan does not do additional checks that `read.delim` would. Always verify your data after reading in with `scan`.
