**user**:
> In a isoelastic/CCRA utility function, is eta the elasticity of income?
**assistant**:
> No, η in an isoelastic or Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function is *not* the elasticity of income. Instead, it is known as the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
> 
> In the context of utility functions, elasticity usually refers to the percentage change in one variable in response to a percentage change in another variable. However, η in a utility function describes the consumer's levels of risk aversion.
> 
> The basic form of a CRRA utility function is:
> 
> U(C) = C^(1-η) / (1-η) 
> 
> where:
> - U(C) is the utility derived from consumption C.
> - η is the coefficient of relative risk aversion (not the elasticity of income). 
> 
> This parameter η determines the consumer’s aversion to risk when consumption levels vary. If η > 1, the consumer is said to be risk averse. If η = 1, the consumer is risk neutral. And if 0 < η < 1, the consumer is risk loving.
