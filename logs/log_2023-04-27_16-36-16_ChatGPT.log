**assistant**:
> In R, you can get the 10th lowest number from a vector using the `sort()` function and indexing. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. Sort the vector in ascending order using the `sort()` function.
> 2. Access the 10th element in the sorted vector using indexing (`[]`).

> Here's an example:
> 
> ```R
> # Create a vector
> my_vector <- c(34, 12, 67, 28, 45, 89, 11, 0, 56, 76, 21, 39, 90, 5, 33, 18)
> 
> # Sort the vector in ascending order
> sorted_vector <- sort(my_vector)
> 
> # Get the 10th lowest number
> tenth_lowest <- sorted_vector[10]
> 
> # Print the result
> print(tenth_lowest)
> ```
> 
> If you want to do it in one line, you can do the following:

> tenth_lowest <- sort(my_vector)[10]

> Keep in mind that this approach assumes that there are at least 10 unique elements in the vector. If there are fewer than 10 unique elements, you may get unexpected results. In that case, you can use the `unique()` function to first remove duplicate values:
> 
> ```R
> tenth_lowest <- sort(unique(my_vector))[10]
> ```
> 
> This will return the 10th unique lowest number if there are at least 10 unique elements, otherwise, it will return `NA`.

**assistant**:
> In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items (without regard to the order of selection) is called a combination. The formula for combinations is given by:

> C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
> 
> where n! (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to n, and C(n, k) is read as "n choose k."
> 
> In your case, you want to choose 10 values out of a set of 30, so n = 30 and k = 10. Applying the formula:
> 
> C(30, 10) = 30! / (10! * (30 - 10)!)
> 
> You can calculate this value in R using the `choose()` function:
> 
> ```R
> n <- 30
> k <- 10
> combinations <- choose(n, k)
> print(combinations)
> ```
> 
> Running this code will give you the result:
> 
> ```R
> [1] 30045015
> ```

> So, there are 30,045,015 different ways to choose 10 values out of a set of 30.
