> Review of “Review of Global methane action pays for itself at least six times over”
> Overall assessment
> The paper focuses on estimating the economic benefits of the Methane Pledge
> initiated at COP26. It employs the social-cost based IAM META, which, among its
> features, includes an assessment of climate damages from tipping points and a
> downscaling of damages to national levels. The paper is well-written and highly
> relevant; however, certain aspects do not reach the level of rigor and novelty I
> believe is required for top-tier journals like Science. My primary arguments for this
> view are as follows:
> 1. Lack of Novelty and Groundbreaking Results: I do not find the results sufficiently
> novel or groundbreaking. For instance, Cael & Goodwin (2023) have already
> provided an estimate of the economic climate benefits of the Methane Pledge, albeit
> through a simpler approach than the one taken in this paper. Surprisingly, this work
> is not cited in the reviewed paper. Additionally, the methodological approach used
> in the paper largely resembles estimations of the social cost of methane, a topic that
> has been discussed for over four decades
> 2. Placement of Social Cost of Methane Discussion: Although the paper extensively
> and effectively discusses the social cost of methane, this critical topic is not
> mentioned upfront in the paper. I found this omission peculiar, as the social cost
> is the marginal economic benefit of methane abatement. Estimating the benefits
> of reducing emissions along a pathway is straightforward in models capable of
> calculating the social cost of methane. Therefore, the estimate of mitigation benefits
> along a pathway seems more of a minor scientific contribution.
> 3. Concerns Regarding Methane Abatement Cost Calculation: The paper estimates
> methane abatement costs based on marginal abatement cost (MAC) estimates from
> the US EPA and IIASA, with abatement levels derived as the difference between the
> baseline (SSP2-4.5) and the Methane Pledge pathway (based on scenarios in the
> IAMC 1.5°C Scenario Explorer). However, I have concerns about inconsistencies.
> The MAC values used in the paper exhibit negative costs, which is inconsistent
> with how emission baselines are typically estimated in IAMs. These models usually
> assume cost-effectiveness, meaning there are no negative abatement costs—if such
> costs existed, emissions would already have been reduced (i.e., there are no "free
> lunches" in an IAM). The approach to estimating abatement costs is too much of a
> back-of-the-envelope calculation, which falls short of the standards expected in a top-
> level journal like Science.
> Still, the paper has several strong, novel, and interesting aspects:
> 1. The explicit treatment of tipping points in social cost estimates are both innovative
> and intriguing.
> 2. The distributional analysis is compelling and original.
> 3. I found Section 1.5 "Effect of Methane Action on Climate Risk", the discussion
> related to Figure 4 and the analysis of VaR and CVaR particularly inspiring and
> novel.
> 4. Section 1.6 "The Social Cost of Methane" is well-written and engaging. However,
> while the estimates and related discussions of social cost are strong, they do not
> achieve the level of novelty required for publication in a top-tier journal such as
> Science.
> Recommendation: I recommend rejection for publication in Science, but I believe this
> paper would be highly suitable for resubmission to a journal at a slightly lower tier,
> such as Science Advances.
> Specific comments:
> Line 15, abstract. The authors write "But research on the economic benefits of
> methane action is still sparse." Comment: Yes, but there are a range of papers on
> social cost of methane, primarily focusing on the climate impact of methane, but also
> on the health and ecosystem impacts, see for example Shindell (2017), Sarofirm et al
> (2017) and Cael & Goodwin (2023)
> Line 16-17, abstract. The authors write "first comprehensive assessment of the
> economic benefits of methane abatement". Comment: In what way is this the first? It
> is the first that makes a comprehensive assessment of the benefits of the methane
> pledge, but not on methane abatement as such. There are a range of studies that
> have estimated the social cost of methane, being the marginal economic benefit of
> methane abatement, and of which some are discussed on the paper.
> Line 18, abstract. the authors write "New generation". Comment: It is a new model,
> but what does “new generation” mean exactly? How is a “new generation” different
> from incremental development of the “old generation”? I think bold statements
> like need to be justified. This may not necessarily be explained and justified in the
> abstract but needs to be explained in the text if the wording is kept.
> Line 50. The authors write "the pre-eminence of 2100 temperature as the ultimate
> goal of climate policy". Comment: To my knowledge the temperature in 2100 is not
> pointed out as the ultimate goal in climate policy documents from UNFCC, and I
> doubt that IPCC would state something like that if it were not backed up by policy
> documentation.
> Line 65-74. Comment: I think that the paragraph here is somewhat misleading. In
> other places of the paper the authors discuss the literature on the social cost of
> methane (SCM). I do not understand why it is not introduced here since SCM is
> the marginal economic benefit of methane action. Hence, its critical to introduce
> SCM here to give the correct framing of the literature and given the correct scientific
> background. Also, the 2021 Global Methane Assessment was not the first study to
> analyse non-climate benefits of methane abatement, see for example Shindell et al
> (2017), Sarofirm et al (2017).
> Line 88. The authors write "the new generation of scoial-cost IAMs". Comment: What
> exactly do you mean with new generation of social cost IAMs. In what way is this
> new generation different from incremental updates of older IAMs such as FUND and
> DICE?
> Line 90-92. Comment: To follow up on my comment above. It is not anything new
> generation in the aspects mentioned in these lines, the aspects mentioned here
> has been part of social cost IAMs since the 1990s, see for example Hoel & Isaksen
> (1995), Fankhauser (1994) and Schmalensee (1993).
> Line 134-137. Comment: The approach to how the methane abatement cost is
> estimated appears to me to be inconsistent with the abatement cost functions used
> for the IAM included in the IAMC 1.5 °C Scenario Explorer. If the methane abatement
> costs where negative in the reference scenario (SSP2-4.5) the results of that
> reference scenario would be inconsistent with the cost-effectiveness assumptions in
> process rich IAMs.
> Line 202-24: Comment: To follow up in my comment just above. It is something
> strange with the results since negative costs would not be found in the underlying
> IAM generating the SSP2-4.5. I find the approach used be the authors here a to be
> too much of a back of the envelope estimate. My opinion would be to abandon the

> overall quality of the study.
> Line 358-360. Comment: Note that ref 45 (Azar et al) uses the preferred calibration
> in ref 34 (Howard & Sterner) while US EPA uses another calibration presented in
> Howard & Stener. The calibration in US EPA leads to lower damages for a certain
> level of temperature change , and consequently a lower social cost of methane (all
> else the same).

> ‘Global methane action pays for itself at least six times over’ is a well-written and

> Please see my comments below by section, organized by section.
> A. Abstract:
> 1. Generally, the abstract is quite long (about 350 words). I am unsure of Science’s
> exact requirements, but even with an unlimited word count, the abstract should be
> more focused to ensure a clean and clear takeaway for readers who will not read
> the full paper. I find the paper straightforward with clear takeaways, and I think the
> authors can effectively highlight the most important points in 200 to 250 words. My
> comments below contained detailed suggestions.
> 2. L19: I recommend either defining this acronym here or avoiding it. Removing ",
> META," works just fine.
> 3. L19-21: This description of META is somewhat convoluted. I think the authors
> need to figure out a better way to explain what the model does in brief. Is it
> necessary to explain the coupling in the abstract? Perhaps just focus on the benefits
> of using META (i.e., the national damages and tipping points) atop a simpler climate
> model? Maybe it is just the “simple climate model from the climate science literature”
> wording that convolutes…
> 4. L23-24: Remove “. This may sound small, but it would be highly beneficial. It would
> reduce climate damages in 2050 from 3.5% of global GDP to 3.1%” for brevity.
> 5. L28-29: Perhaps consolidate to a list for brevity.
> 6. L31-32: Remove “i.e., the marginal climate damage cost of methane,” for brevity.
> 7. L33-36: Revise to “We provide country-level estimates of the SC-CH4, which
> indicate that key economies would be motivated to act on methane at marginal
> abatement costs exceeding $500/tCH4 even if they only value damages within their
> own borders.”
> B. Introduction
> 1. L40-43: This deserves some more detail. Why have the activities associated with
> emissions and/or their emission rates changed? Specifically, why the plateau and
> why now the return to growth? Are changes in different economies around the world
> (e.g., emerging versus developed) contributing to these trends? Is the shift from coal
> to natural gas in many countries relevant? Etc.
> 2. L49: “Some have gone on to argue” to “Previous work has argued” for better flow.
> 3. L49-57: I recommend reordering these somehow. The sentence starting at L49 is
> intuitively followed by the sentence starting at L54. Perhaps start the paragraph with
> the sentence starting at L52.
> 4. L63-64: Are any major players missing from the 155 countries? It would be useful
> to acknowledge if so or otherwise acknowledge that all major players are committed.
> 5. L66-71: If I understand this correctly, the first sentence discusses non-monetized
> benefits and the second sentence discusses monetized benefits. If I am correct, it
> couldn't hurt to make that a bit clearer.
> 6. L79: What does “recent simple” mean? As in, what is “recent” and what is
> “simple”? I don’t necessarily think these words need to be defined here, but I think
> they should be addressed somewhere in the main paper.
> 7. L79-80: The wording “in line with climate science” is a bit unclear. Does this mean
> that the model has been “recently” calibrated or something of the likes? Perhaps
> specify that if so.
> 8. L81: Regarding “and temperature and sea-level mechanisms”—are these
> examples of non-market damages or are they additional mechanisms?
> 9. L86-87: How are improved air quality benefits calculated? I recommend noting that
> you take country-level marginal damage estimates from the literature, rather than
> focusing on a vague “simpler calculation of benefits.”
> 10. L94: Replace “the marginal damage cost or social cost of GHGs” with “the
> marginal damage or social cost of GHGs.”
> 11. L88-102: Just noting that this is an excellent paragraph.
> C. Results: Brief summary of methods
> 1. L114-116: I recommend the authors briefly define “(1.5.C; SSP2-4.5; SSP3-7.0)”
> so that a reader without a strong background in climate science can understand the
> basics of what they mean.
> 2. L137-140: Specify that these air quality co-benefits are avoided health damages
> from methane-caused tropospheric ozone. See Comment L4 for a follow-up.
> D. Results: Methane emissions and effect on temperatures
> 1. L142-146: I find these scenarios confusing. I understand, generally, that the
> central scenario is a 30% methane cut and that then there are lower and higher
> scenarios but how these scenarios are generated is unclear. See Comment J3 for a
> follow-up.
> 2. Figure 1: Add leading zeros to the y-axis of the right-side plot for clarity.
> 3. Figure 1: Use colors in the legend for clarity.
> 4. L157-158: To ensure I understand correctly, the Global Methane Plan action (-30%
> of 2020 CH4 emissions) contributes to the 1.5dC scenario? Like in place of other
> solutions—e.g., more carbon reduction?
> 5. L167-169: This observation is not in line with what I see in Figure 1’s left-side plot.
> Perhaps I misunderstand the authors’ intended message here, but shouldn’t the solid
> line intersect the central scenario’s dotted line within the plot’s limits along the x-axis
> (i.e., at 2070)?
> E. Results: Total economic benefits of methane action
> 1. L191-192: What are these parametric uncertainties?
> 2. Figure 2: How do tipping points play into the analysis and the economics?
> Should we see any clear economic impacts when tipping points are hit (or rather
> avoided, here)? Why does that not appear to occur in the plots? I would expect
> to see damages jump at certain points and, hence, avoided damages also jump
> analogously. Could the authors provide more information on this?
> 3. Figure 2: Use colors in the legend for clarity.
> 4. L202-204: This is a really important point in this analysis that I think needs more
> attention in the paper. I will note that, while it is addressed in the next sentence, I
> asked myself immediately what this point meant. Perhaps lead with the fact that

> the authors should explore in the discussion section.
> 5. L218-220: This is a well-placed and well-conceived note on this limitation of the
> analysis.
> F. Results: Distributional effects of methane action
> 1. L222-223: This is an odd sentence. Are you implying that climate damages are
> heterogeneous across the world vary (partly) because of national income? If so, you
> should state that more clearly. It may be beneficial to briefly list the variables that
> are most influential for the heterogeneity—e.g., population, national income, actual/
> expected environmental impacts. See Comment H3 for a follow-up.
> 2. L226-228: A follow-up to the previous comment—do income groupings influence
> marginal damages? I think it is important to clarify whether this observation is driven
> purely by exogenous factors.
> 3. L235-236: I just want to note that this is a nice additional assessment.
> 4. Figure 3: I would change this figure’s title and/or x-axis. "Climate damages [...]
> avoided" suggests that the data are benefits. However, the x-axis is clearly costs—
> e.g., more negative delta annual consumption loss for low-income aligns with higher
> benefits, as confirmed by the text.
> G. Results: Effect of methane action on climate risk
> 1. L241-243: This is a good concise description of these metrics. I think this serves
> as a guide for some other content that needs a bit more explanation (e.g., emissions
> scenarios).
> 2. Figure 4: Regarding “Left panel includes tipping points, right panel omits tipping
> points.”—should this be part of the bolded title? Maybe not actually, but because the
> red and grey bars are defined in the title, it sort of seems like the left and right should
> also be defined. Just a thought.
> 3. L253: Replace “distinctly different” with “distinct.”
> 4. L253-259: Are “process-based models” well-summarized as “deterministic”? Are
> the processes represented by hazard events and hazard rates well-summarized as
> “probabilistic”? If so, I think it’d be very helpful to add these terms.
> 5. L260-277: I do not have any problem with the tipping point intensity analysis,
> but I do think the authors have an opportunity to further describe this in a way that
> would increase understanding. Zero and one on the scale make perfect sense to
> me; however, between them is slightly unclear. Perhaps give an example of what

> H. Results: Social cost of methane
> 1. L295-296: I am not saying this is not the first paper to provide country-level
> estimates of the SC-CH4. However, the authors should at least acknowledge that
> Ricke et al. (2018) (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0282-y) provided
> national SC-CO2 estimates, which likely produced similar relative distributional
> effects. I recommend that the authors provide a comparison to this studies’ findings
> unless the authors have a reason why such a comparison would be unhelpful or
> scientifically unsound. (Note: I do not think this is essential to support the critical
> conclusions of the paper, but I do think it would be highly beneficial.)
> 2. L296: “Welfare changes” needs defined.
> 3. L296-298: This warrants a clearer explanation on how (1) national income and (2)
> population counts affect (or otherwise do not affect) the national SC-CH4.
> 4. L300-302: This is excellent and should be a focus of the discussion section.
> 5. L312-314: A follow up from the previous comment, I think the U.S. election results
> warrant a blunter way of saying this. Something that indicates that this is very likely to
> happen.
> 6. L319-322: What is this dependent on? Changes in temperatures and emissions
> or changes in economic activity? I think clarity on why these values increase is
> warranted. Is it because the climate system is becoming more stressed? Is it

> 7. L328-330: I know these details are in Drupp et al. (2018), but perhaps a quick

> 8. L331-332: Maybe restate this. The social discount rate varies over time and by

> 9. L335-336: Just noting that this is excellent.
> 10. L337-338: The authors should be careful here and clearly state what is and what

> b. Methane action is pro-poor.
> c. Methane abatement makes sense for some major players even if countries only

> 4. L695: This comment has three parts.
> a. Somewhere in the paper, the authors need to make it clear that these air quality

> another integrated assessment model focused on air quality. However, the authors
> need to be clear on what that information includes and does not include.
> b. I recommend that the authors provide a high-level overview of the key factors
> differentiating the impacts of local air pollution from those of greenhouse gases.
> While the authors note that greenhouse gases are well-mixed (L40), it would
> be beneficial to elaborate on how local air pollution, specifically tropospheric
> ozone, differs. For local air pollution, concentrations are influenced by the location
> of emissions, atmospheric dispersion, and chemical reactions. Exposures are
> determined by population distribution relative to these concentrations. Additionally,
> concentration-response relationships depend on relative risk, while damages are
> driven by the valuation of mortality and morbidity risks.
> c. The authors should then acknowledge the substantial limitations of taking country-

> Can you provide a summary of the biggest substantial points raised by these reviewers?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Below is a summary of the key substantial points raised by the reviewers for your paper:
> 
> 1. **Novelty and Citation Concerns:**
>    - Reviewer 1 criticizes the lack of novelty, noting that similar estimations of the economic benefits of the Methane Pledge have been done, referencing Cael & Goodwin (2023), which should be cited. Reviewer 2 does not express concerns about novelty, believing the paper's claims are novel.
> 
> 2. **Methodological Issues:**
>    - Reviewer 1 raises concerns about the estimation of methane abatement costs, noting negative costs are inconsistent with the assumptions of IAMs. They suggest the existing approach might be too simplistic for a top-tier journal.
>    - Reviewer 2 suggests clarification on the abstraction and explanation of models, scenarios, and terminologies, indicating that the paper might benefit from clearer methodological communication.
> 
> 3. **Contribution to Literature:**
>    - Reviewer 1 points out that the discussion around the social cost of methane should be more pronounced in the early parts of the paper, as it is critical to understanding the marginal benefits of methane abatement.
