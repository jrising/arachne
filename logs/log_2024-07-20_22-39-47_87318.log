> In Shiny, can I compute something in a renderPlotly function which I then use in a renderDT? Or how can I make sure that my common computation is performed first, and then use it for both?

> Absolutely, you can share computations between different rendering functions in Shiny by using reactive expressions. This avoids redundant computations and ensures consistency across your app. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. **Create a reactive expression for your common computation.**
> 2. **Use this reactive expression in both `renderPlotly` and `renderDT`.**

> Here's an example:
> 
> ```r
> library(shiny)
> library(plotly)
> library(DT)
> 
> ui <- fluidPage(
>   plotlyOutput("myPlot"),
>   DTOutput("myTable")
> )
> 
> server <- function(input, output, session) {
>   # Reactive expression for the common computation
>   common_computation <- reactive({
>     # Replace with your actual computation
>     data <- mtcars
>     data$mpg_to_hp <- data$mpg / data$hp
>     data
>   })
>   
>   output$myPlot <- renderPlotly({
>     data <- common_computation()
>     plot_ly(data, x = ~mpg, y = ~mpg_to_hp) %>%
>       add_markers()
>   })
>   
>   output$myTable <- renderDT({
>     data <- common_computation()
>     datatable(data)
>   })
> }
> 
> shinyApp(ui, server)
> ```

> In this example:
> 
> - `common_computation` is a reactive expression that performs the needed computation once.
> - This reactive value is then used in both the `renderPlotly` and `renderDT` functions.
> 
> **Key Points:**
> - Reactive expressions are lazy, meaning they only run when their values are needed.
> - When the reactive expression is updated, it will trigger updates in the outputs that depend on it.
> 
> This approach ensures efficient and consistent data handling across different rendering functions in your Shiny app.
