His canals can be a little bit more meandering, so that that can rise to some issues with algae build up, and not as good a flushing but both of them sort of use the same matrix.

> Natalie Magdeburger: concerns. We haven't had any dune breaches. We have sort of a a dual dune system where you've got sort of one dune, and then a little bit of a gully, and then a bigger dune, and that has worked, and our dunes are growing. So on the ocean side the Army Corps of engineers has done a great job, and I think you know, part of it is, you know, they're planning. Part of it is just the geography and the you know how our town

> 48

We still some of the old cottages that go back into the fifties in the early sixties, which would have been either at ground level, or, you know, 3 feet

> 56
> 00:07:43.986 --> 00:08:08.520
> Natalie Magdeburger: so they potentially could still be at risk, or parts of them could be at risk. But most of our homes are on the bayside community now have been built up, you know my my house, you know. Be a good example. I had an older cottage, and we knocked it down and built a more full time residence. And my entire lower level is basically what I would call garage space.

> 57

> Natalie Magdeburger: So there isn't any. There's no bathrooms, there's no you know. It's it's garage wood shop, you know that kind of stuff. And then our living quarters are on the second and the 3rd floor of our property. We have a height limitation of 30 feet here in Fenwick, so we don't want our buildings to be higher than 30 feet. We have a 2 foot free board space that we allow for. So technically, they can go up to 32 feet.

> ### Interview Questions
> **CW:** So, I've talked to some people further north up the coast. You're the first person I've gotten to talk to from Fenwick, or that far south down in Delaware. Can you talk to me a little bit about your position as mayor, and how you are seeing the risk of coastal flooding and the impact on Fenwick in particular?  
> **Interviewee:** So we are a coastal community. We've got a rather long history of dealing with the curveballs that Mother Nature sends to us. Coastal flooding in and of itself is not new. When we choose to live here, we choose to deal with those complications that arise. What we have seen is that there is an increase in the number of events. We have seen also that there is an increase in the number of what we would call sunny day events, more tidal components to them. Obviously, any kind of storm that comes off of our coast—nor'easters, hurricanes, tropical storms—those are all events that we are very attuned to and react to. We haven't had the degree of flooding that we had in a major event like Hurricane Sandy. I think the big event that all of us still, if we don't remember it, we certainly can communicate about it, which is the storm of 1962. That really did a lot of damage flooding. Those events have been occurring for a long time. Our town itself, when you go back into the history, you can see that it built and rebuilt several times along the shore, and with each storm that would come in and kind of wash away the villages or the little cottages, they would come back and redo it again. It's nothing new to our history, but we are seeing more events, and we are seeing more of what I would call sunny day events.  
> 
> **CW:** Where do you see those impacts happening?  
> **Interviewee:** The impacts that we see are primarily on the bayside community. Probably 80% of our town, close to 80% of our town, is on the bay side. We were a town that was kind of built out of marshland way back in the day. We had two groups that came in and developed our bayside community. One was Colonel Schultz. He was part of the National Guard, and I believe he was in the Army Corps of Engineers. We have very straight series of canals and lagoons that he built to create. They used the fill from the lagoons to make building lots. The other part of our town, which is on the south side, was developed by Madison Gray. His canals are a little more meandering, which gives rise to issues with algae buildup and not as good flushing. Both groups used the same matrix. Our bayside community is either on the water or close to the water, and it is subject to both tidal surges and a lot of rain. When the bay is high and we get a lot of rain, it makes the problem that much more compounded.

> **CW:** What do you see as the biggest area for concern?  
> **Interviewee:** We have to be able to safely get to and from our homes. A good part of our community is on the bayside, and that's the area that has the highest degree of flooding. The Army Corps of Engineers has done a great job in creating a useful and efficient dune system. Although the homes we have on the oceanfront are always at risk, we haven't had any dune breaches. We have sort of a dual dune system, with one dune, a little gully, and then a bigger dune. That has worked, and our dunes are growing. The ocean side is not as concerning. That's always at risk, especially with a big hurricane. One of the first questions we're going to be asking during a hurricane is whether our dunes hold. You only need to look back at the pictures from the storm of '62 to see what happens when the dunes don't hold. With nor'easters, particularly in the winter, on a weekly basis this past winter, areas in town on a weekly basis are underwater, particularly during high tide events that coincide with storms. Those are the more immediate and repetitive issues that we deal with.

> Our town has undergone many transformations in the last 20 to 30 years. Most of the homes on the bayside community are newer and higher. There aren't many living quarters on the first floor. We still have some of the older cottages from the fifties and early sixties, which might be at ground level or three feet up, and they could be at risk, or parts of them could be at risk. But most of our bayside homes have been built up. For example, my house had an older cottage that we knocked down to build a full-time residence. The entire lower level is garage space, and our living quarters are on the second and third floors of our property. We have a height limitation of 30 feet in Fenwick, with a 2-foot freeboard space allowance, so buildings can go up to 32 feet.

> We're focusing on resiliency and how to combat and mitigate ongoing events. We've done a resiliency study that updated the exact problems we'll face and over what period. We recently applied for a federal grant for engineering recommendations specific to particular areas. Suggestions include raising bulkheads, putting in berms, considering living shorelines, enclosing boat ramps, installing pumps, and prioritizing these actions. By 2080, nearly 75-80% of our town is expected to be underwater during normal high tide events. We are proactive with engineering studies providing definitive answers. We're also creating a better GIS mapping system that wasn't done in our town or as part of the overall Delaware studies.

> We need more regional focus and collaboration. The back bay study with Denrek and the Army Corps of Engineers was essential but abandoned. We need state funding and collaborative efforts to create effective regional solutions. We will protect our town, but it would be better if the efforts were regional, crossing state lines to benefit all.
