> I am forming an advisory group for a grant project. I have a couple documents describing the project:
> ===
> 
> Economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK, and benefits of adaptation action
> 
> Informal scoping document
> December 2024
> 
> 1. Overview and scope
> 
> We are looking to produce UK-level climate damage scenarios with a specific focus on the macro-economic impacts. We want to use these impacts as the basis for developing our understanding of the fiscal impacts, and as part of a longer-term piece around the benefits of adaptation actions.
> 
> We want to try and take a hybrid approach bringing together all the best UK sector modelling and then incorporating the results within a macro-modelling framework like Nigem. To note, this approach mirrors the one in Nicola’s Nature GFI study.
> 
> 2. Context
> 
> Over the past year, we’ve done a bit of work using Nigem/ NGFS and come up against the fact that they are not UK-specific and have limited coverage of risk channels (including nothing on international spillovers). Colleagues on the fiscal side built an internal tool to translate macro impacts into fiscal ones, but the work was paused due to the issues with NGFS at a UK level. 
> 
> The OBR covered climate damages as part of their Fiscal Risks and Sustainability report 2024, but have held off covering adaptation due to current data gaps. They plan to come back to this in the next phase of the work (most likely, post-CCRA4 publication in 2026).
> 
> Finally, we’ve been working with Paul Watkiss as part of his ACCREU (EC Horizon) work on adaptation investment needs, building on the CCC’s adaptation investment report. This has been useful in framing our thinking but has also shone a light on the variable quality of the evidence on the benefits of adaptation action. We would like to improve this as part of an ongoing programme of work, linking it back to the climate damage assessment, which we see as the key first step.
> 
> We’ve pulled together a community of interested parties across HMG and got support from our Executive Management Board here at HMT. The OBR are also really keen to be able to do more having taken stock of just how challenging it is in their recent FRS report.
> 
> There are other programmes of work which we can draw on:
> •	UKRI projects. This includes a climate-related food price shocks project led by Pete Smith and Anna Taylor and an ATTENUATE project which looks at the benefits of adaptation action, taking a case studies approach.
> •	CCRA4 – this includes sectoral deep dives. The intention is to publish a dataset in spreadsheet form which includes benefits of adaptation action.
> •	Project Delta (including BoE and Met Office) which is looking at improving the quality of granular UK data on physical risks.
> 
> 3. Research questions and objectives
> 
> There are three core questions which HMT (and the OBR) would like to be in a position to answer:
> a)	What are UK macroeconomic impacts of climate change, including international spillovers/imported risk (addressing the limitations of NGFS), and accounting for autonomous adaptation and its costs?
> b)	What are the fiscal impacts associated with these damage and adaptation costs (updating the OBR FRS24, which relied on NGFS for inputs)?
> c)	Across a suite of key adaptation options, what are fiscal and socioeconomic costs associated with various levels of risk reduction?
> d)	How can funding best distributed across adaptation options to achieve risk reduction goals?
> 
> We are looking for expertise in particular on a) and c), with an initial focus on a). If needed, we can scope b) out and cover that within HMT/OBR.
> 
> The objectives are then:
> 1.	Shape HMT’s understanding and response to climate risk, including our approach to managing economic and fiscal risk and our international and financial stability work (questions a-c, with a focus on a). 
> 1.1.	Develop outputs on macroeconomic impacts that we can use as part of our core narrative across HMT and for Ministers, as well as the basis for our ongoing work in this space.
> 1.2.	Set out an economic baseline which includes climate damage for use as a reference point for framing our work on economic growth, rather than the de facto ‘no climate’ baseline.
> 2.	Ensure our quantification of the fiscal risks is based on the best evidence that we have no major gaps on transmission channels.
> 3.	Ensure spending decisions on climate adaptation are based on the best possible evidence, and the benefits can be traced back to an assessment of UK climate damages.
> 4.	Support timely decision-making as part of an ongoing programme of work, by designing the approach to include new evidence as and when this is available, including 2026 CCRA4 outputs on adaptation, and developing open-source tools.
> 5.	Support other countries to undertake similar work, by developing open-source tools and sharing insights.
> 
> 4. Outputs
> 
> The critical piece for us is that the modelling tools and assumptions are fully transparent and well documented, including detailed outputs in spreadsheet format (interim sectoral results and macroeconomic outputs) which can be shared. 
> 
> Ideally, we would like to be able to run the macroeconomic model in-house, as would the OBR, and develop tools that can be updated with better evidence as and when (including CCRA4 outputs for example, or anything coming out of OECD and IMF modelling on the international side). Being able to run models in-house also increases the likelihood that these will have a more significant policy impact and become embedded in day-to-day thinking.
> 
> 5. Approach
>  
> We want to bring together some of the best sector modelling expertise across the UK, building on the 2021 Grantham study, including people like Paul Bates from Bristol on floods. On the international side, we would like to try and replicate some of the approach again in the GFI study which covered complex supply chain risks and food price impacts across multiple scenarios (e.g. El Nino, multiple breadbasket failures), bringing together relevant experts in each area and using historical analogues to fill data gaps). Brendan Bailey here at HMT would be a very good person to have involved in this as someone with a lot of expertise and relevant knowledge. 
>  
> In order to be able to aggregate fiscal impacts, we also need to be able to split out public and private sector benefits.
> 
> From our work to date, we are particularly aware of the poor quality of evidence on the benefits of adaptation action – it is therefore really important to be able to build in better information on this as the evidence continues to be developed.
>  
> We’d also like to try and build in a bit of a backcasting exercise to calibrate estimates with historical damage. There’s some existing work going on there at Manchester University and some more in the pipeline. Note that the Met Office are interested in building a database of damage costs in the future which could be used as a data source (replicating something that NOAA have which goes back to the 80s and has great visualisations - Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters | National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) (noaa.gov)).
> 
> Scenarios
> We would like to take a scenarios approach, which reflects different levels of warming. This could build on the OBR’s approach in FRS24 where they had two scenarios – a) under 2 degrees C and b) under 3 degrees C.
> 
> We suggest adding to that: c) under 4 degrees C, plus d) scenario(s) which look at tail risks such as AMOC collapse.
> 
> Outstanding questions
> Important questions to be worked up are:
> •	What are the information requirements from the sectoral models (including format) 
> •	What macro framework do we want to work with
> •	What are the boundaries for the work (i.e. do we scope out the fiscal impacts on the basis that HMT/OBR can cover these)
> •	What can be delivered under a first phase of the work (e.g. a [6] month timeline).
> 
> 
> 6. Tasks
> 
> We’ve discussed splitting the work in to two phases.
> 
> Phase 1
> An initial [6]-month phase which looks at rapidly bringing together evidence on the impacts of climate damage and incorporates these into a macroeconomic modelling framework, working with macro modellers to generate UK-wide impacts (i.e. question a).
> 
> Success criteria:
> •	New dataset set out in spreadsheet with time series of economic impacts broken down by sector, in a format in which it can be built into a macro model.
> •	New inputs on international risks / spillovers in a format which can be integrated.
> •	Plan in train for incorporating these into a macro modelling framework, ideally with initial results.
> 
> We think this is achievable because the existing LSE Grantham study already brings together a lot of the useful UK-specific data. Nicola’s Nature GFI study is a great example of what you can do on international supply chain impacts within a 6-12 month window (as well as a great test case for using a hybrid approach).
> 
> Phase 2
> Expanding the scope to cover question c in particular.
> 
> 7. Governance
> We would be happy to participate by way of steering group, alongside a number of other public bodies and experts, to maximise the policy relevance of the work and ensure it is built into our work (e.g. forecasting, framing of green growth, link to how we estimate indirect effects on the fiscal side, potentially also growth metrics).
> 
> As a core user group, I think you want:
> •	HMT (mix of teams, including EGU and Economic Risks)
> •	OBR (suggest Alison Todd)
> •	Defra (Ashley Diggins).
> 
> We could consider adding CCC, Met Office and BoE (we can suggest contacts again).
> 
> Jenny has some leave planned in Q1 of next year, but can add touchpoints for this work.
> ===
> Economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK, and benefits of adaptation action
> 
> Organisational Background:
> This project brings together expertise from multiple institutions, drawing upon top experts and models from the UK and beyond. This consortium, which will continue to grow beyond the project period, is a valuable outcome of the grant, as a vital foundation for future work. The project lead is James Rising, Visiting Fellow to the  Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), which will coordinate the project. Established in 2008, GRI is a multidisciplinary centre, bringing together expertise on economics, finance, geography, the environment, science, law, international relations, development and political science. GRI exists to accelerate the transition to a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world by conducting world-class research, engaging with stakeholders worldwide, and educating future professionals. Chaired by Professor Lord Nicholas Stern, GRI is recognized internationally for its leadership in climate policy and was awarded the 2021 Queen’s Anniversary Prize for its significant contributions to climate economics and policy.
> 
> High-Level Framing and Problem Statement:
> Climate change poses significant economic and fiscal risks to the United Kingdom, threatening both short-term stability and long-term prosperity. At the same time, future impacts depend on proactive adaptation, resilience in communities and in the financial system, and accurate targeting of public funds. This project addresses the urgent need for comprehensive, UK-specific climate damage scenarios that inform fiscal policy and adaptation strategies, based upon a flexible framework that can be updated over time as new evidence emerges and which is available to test assumptions and sensitivities. It also acts as a pioneering study internationally, offering an approach that can be adapted to other countries.
> 
> The Problem: Current models, such as those used by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios, lack the specificity required to address the UK’s unique geography and economic structure and overlook complex risk channels, including international spillovers. Additionally, existing assessments, like the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) 2024 report  and the GRI study on UK risks , indicate significant gaps in data related to adaptation costs and benefits, preventing a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities and opportunities for proactive measures. While the GRI study estimated a wide range of impacts, it did not provide a mechanism for continuous updating and use of the results or focus on near-term risks and the associated role of near-term adaptation.
> 
> Therefore, this proposal seeks to integrate sector-specific impacts into a cohesive macroeconomic framework, enabling evidence-based fiscal policy decisions and advancing knowledge on adaptation benefits and costs. This will support strategic decision-making, ensuring the UK efficiently allocates resources to bolster resilience and mitigate economic vulnerabilities from climate-related disturbances.
> 
> This proposal builds upon ongoing efforts, including the GRI study, the Green Finance Institute and University of Oxford’s work on nature-related risks ; the Horizon-funded ACCREU project , and initiatives under UKRI and Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA4). By developing open-source tools and sharing insights, the project will set a precedent for similar work worldwide, and foster a global understanding of adaptation benefits and climate risks.
> 
> Objective:
> The overarching objective of this 12-month proposal is to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the economic and fiscal risks posed by climate damages to the UK, while also evaluating the benefits of adaptation actions. This framework will provide high-resolution insights into macroeconomic impacts, enabling informed decision-making and effective management of climate-related economic and fiscal risks.
> 
> Specifically, the proposal aims to:
> O1: Enhance Understanding of UK Macroeconomic Impacts of Climate Change: Shape the understanding of climate risks and their macroeconomic implications, including international spillovers and costs of autonomous adaptation. Under this objective, we would provide the first comprehensive estimates of the potential implications of physical climate change for the UK across a range of macroeconomic variables (MEVs).
> O2: Advance Quantification of the Fiscal Risks Related to Climate Change: Ensure robust quantification of fiscal impacts stemming from climate damages and adaptation costs, filling any identified gaps in transmission channels, and learning from existing OBR approaches.
> O3: Inform Public Spending Decisions on Climate Adaptation: Provide evidence-based insights to guide funding decisions for adaptation options, ensuring benefits are tracked against an assessment of UK climate damages.
> O4: Facilitate Timely and Adaptive Decision-Making: Create an adaptive framework for incorporating new evidence and insights as they arise, including those from future assessments and open-source tools.
> O5: Convene a Community of Experts on Climate Risks: Provide a framework in which experts and models are brought together in a way that results in better assessments than current structures produce, and act as a resource for UK government policy-making.
> 
> Future Work: O6: Support Global Capacity Building: Assist other countries in addressing climate-related macroeconomic risks by developing open-source tools and sharing insights derived from the UK’s modelling efforts.
> 
> Theory of change and Strategy
> The theory of change is based on the premise that robust, data-driven insights can fundamentally reshape decision-making about climate risks by providing clear, nuanced information on both economic impacts and adaptation benefits.
> 
> ●	Interconnected Data and Models: By providing a comprehensive macroeconomic framework that is populated by synthesizing of sectoral models and collaborating with experts, we will provide both detailed and transparent climate damage scenarios, but also an approach that can learn and adjust over time. 
> ●	Evidence-Based Fiscal Assessment: By rigorously evaluating fiscal implications from climate damages and adaptation costs, our insights will integrate climate considerations into fiscal policy, ensuring resource allocation reflects empirical data.
> ●	Stakeholder Engagement: Establishing a multi-disciplinary advisory group will foster cross-sectoral knowledge sharing, ensuring that findings resonate with policymakers and support a collective action approach.
> ●	Iterative Learning: Constant integration of new data will keep models adaptive to evolving conditions, facilitating ongoing refinement of strategies and ensuring their relevance over time. The macroeconomic framework will also allow the testing of assumptions and sensitivity analyses, facilitating robust risk analyses, policy identification and appraisal. 
> 
> Strategy: To bring this theory of change to life, the strategy will include:
> ●	Collaboration with Experts: Engage leading researchers and policymakers to expand best practices and deepen understanding of adaptation investment needs, including linking to the UK CCRA4 process.
> ●	Transparent Outputs: Ensure modelling processes are transparent, delivering insights in accessible formats like spreadsheets, empowering stakeholders to leverage data effectively.
> ●	Education and Outreach: Communicate findings to government bodies and industry stakeholders, driving adoption of insights and enhancing policy relevancy.
> ●	Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback loops to incorporate stakeholder feedback and new data, refining tools and strategies over time, and ensuring they remain effective in managing the fiscal and economic risks of climate change.
> 
> This strategy will address the identified problems, offering invaluable insights into climate-related economic and fiscal risks, and guiding resilient policy outcomes in the UK.
> 
> Work Programmes
> 
> WP1: Scenario development
> WP1 consists of two related sets of scenarios: Climate and socioeconomic scenarios, used to project impacts, and risk case study scenarios, used as potential financial stress tests.
> 
> Task 1.1: Develop long-term projection scenarios: Global warming levels are key markers to understand risks, but are not sufficient to project climate risks. Future climate impacts depend upon future socioeconomics, including income levels and inequality, population density, and past adaptation decisions, as well as the rate of warming and the pattern of warming domestically and internationally. This task lays out a set of scenarios, backed by broad narratives, and conforming to 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C global warming levels, and an AMOC scenario. These will build on the scenarios developed for the Climate Financial Risk Forum , developed with Met Office support, which combine strong mitigation (SSP1-2.6), moderate mitigation (SSP2-4.5), and backtracking (SSP3-7.0) scenarios with consideration of central and tail-end climate estimates. Results below will focus on 2035, following these long-term trajectories.
> Future work could represent other features of tail climatic risk, including the Labrador-Irminger Seas Convection tipping point and rapid sea-level rise.
> 
> Task 1.2: Case study scenario identification: In this project, case studies that describe potential macroeconomic and financial stress will be derived from a thorough exploration of the space of bottom-up (WP2) and top-down (WP3) risks. We will identify compound events in the projections, across the range of uncertainty and variability. Case studies will combine chronic shifts in climate with unexpected shocks to particular sectors, and explore how these propagate through the economic system, mirroring the approach in Ranger et al. (2024)3. These will be co-designed in consultation with HM Treasury (HMT). Potential case studies will consider (1) agricultural failures leading to price spikes and inflation; (2) a heat wave driving spiraling hospital costs; and (3) a flooding event which results in infrastructure disruption. This task will translate quantitative information into narratives, while Task 4.1 will translate narratives back into quantitative scenarios for integration with the NiGEM model.
> Future work could explicitly represent cascading impacts through quantitative modelling and engage a larger body of stakeholders in the co-design process.
> 
> WP2: Expanding bottom-up economic risks
> WP2 will improve upon the process developed for Rising et al. (2022)2, where results from detailed models are (a) translated into emulators using each model’s underlying climate assumptions, (b) producing damage functions for UK regions according to the underlying models, and then (c) downscaled to high-resolution administrative units across the UK. The key innovations here consist of (1) incorporating adaptation benefits and costs, drawn from multiple sources and (2) incorporating interannual variability to describe near-term (2025-2035) risks.
> 
>  
>  
> Task 2.1: Collect channel-specific model results. Draw upon new literature and collaboration with experts across the UK to develop a robust set of detailed model results. Drawing upon the work of the ACCREU project4 and the Climate Impact Lab  (CIL), we will also collect results on the costs and benefits of (1) autonomous adaptation and income-driven reductions in vulnerability and (2) policy-driven adaptation investment.

Modelable features of adaptation are labeled as autonomous from empirical work (A), physical changes from engineering estimates (P), optimisation results from cost-benefit analysis (O), or parametrically set (S). Future work will incorporate the channels in italics.
> 
> Task 2.2: Calibrate regional damage functions: Using the approach in Rising et al. (2022), we will fit emulators to the results from Task 2.1. In addition, the relationships between adaptation costs and reductions in vulnerability will be represented as elasticities, allowing us to project damages under any level of social adaptation costs. The reliability of our elasticity approach will be evaluated using bootstrapping, and errors introduced in extrapolating elasticities will be translated into adaptation uncertainty.
> Future work could separately model different types of investments, rather than considering a single aggregate adaptation cost relationship, and account for interdependencies that adaptation approaches have across multiple risks.
> 
> Task 2.3: Projection of domestic biophysical impacts and damages: Domestic impacts and GDP-equivalent damages will be projected under the scenarios from Task 1.1 at high resolution across the UK and annually. Annual impacts will account for uncertainty in individual years, to evaluate extreme risks. This would be prepared as a public data product with interactive maps.
> Future work could build upon the methods from OBR’s FRS24 to estimate fiscal risks, and expand the understanding of financial risks to include insurance and business-side risk.
> WP3: Incorporating adaptation into top-down risks
> Econometric studies have greatly increased our understanding of the impact temperatures and other weather variables have on GDP growth. NGFS currently uses one of these results, from Kotz et al. (2024) , to describe financial risks. However, the NGFS approach misses important evidence. (a) The number of studies that have explored this relationship is rapidly increasing with very different assumptions, and we will use a meta-analysis approach, developed by Rising & Tahmid (WP) , to develop a best-estimate of top-down risks. (b) A number of studies show that impacts to GDP growth are persistent beyond the lower-bound used in Kotz et al., and we will model the uncertainty around these explicitly. (c) Estimates in this literature do not include risks related to sea-level rise, which we will add on. (d) These estimates structurally exclude effects from international interactions, which we will incorporate using a trade model (possibly also NiGEM).
> 
> Task 3.1: Model macro-econometric growth losses: While Rising & Tahmid (WP)9 study the effects of macroeconomic losses from 9 models in this historical period, we will project these damages into the future using the scenarios from Task 1.1, across all countries.
> Future work could incorporate information from expert elicitation of damages, from Howard & Sterner (2017)  and Moore et al. (2024) , and globally-correlated losses from Bilal & Känzig (2024) .
> 
> Task 3.2: Meta-analysis of macro-econometric results: The meta-analysis will synthesise information from the models studied in Task 3.1 to produce a best-estimate of future GDP losses. This approach uses machine learning as developed in Rising & Tahmid (WP)9, and translates draws upon the different results from different study approaches to construct losses that are robustly likely to be estimated from a gold-standard approach.
> 
> Using the best estimate, we will project damages into the future accounting for uncertainty. These will then be input into the NiGEM model to understand how trade will result in risk spillovers for the UK.
> Future work could incorporate “error term” information to explore the variability around impacts, rather than just the expected loss level.
> 
> Task 3.3: Translating GDP loss to UK risk: The GDP losses produced by Task 3.2 require further work to translate into UK risks. While NiGEM produces these spillover effects, we construct a parallel set of UK risk estimates here, to provide the full data coverage needed for Task 5.1. This task follows the steps in Rising and Tahmid (WP)9 (1) translating GDP shocks into persistent GDP losses using a model of economic persistence; (2) incorporating market losses from sea-level rise and coastal storms using the high-resolution using pyCIAM and (3) translating reductions in GDP across the globe to reductions in UK GDP from trade spill-overs, using the Eora26 MRIO model.
> Future work could use a empirically-estimated dynamic vulnerability approach, developed for the PAGE integrated assessment model , to incorporate adaptation into GDP growth effects.
> 
> WP4: Macroeconomic framework integration
> WP4 will combine information from WP2 and WP3 and translate it into inputs appropriate for the NiGEM model, following the approach used in Ranger et al. (2024)3. This is conceived as an iteration with WP1 and a collaboration with NIESR.
> 
> Task 4.1: Elaborate case study scenarios: After case studies have been identified and described across the space of potential risks in Task 1.2, this task will translate those risks into quantitative impacts for the NiGEM macroeconomic model, engaging with NIESR to implement the sector-specific dynamics. This will again use the results from WP2 and WP3 (as in Task 1.2), but draw specifically from results that correspond to the narratives.
> Future work could perform an iterative modelling process, incorporating cascading risk information, whereby the narratives and quantitative representations are developed through repeated stakeholder engagement.
> 
> Task 4.2: Analyse NiGEM results: The results from NiGEM will further inform the narrative process in WP1, and highlight avenues for improvement. The key outcome of the NiGEM integration under this task is a clearer understanding of financial and macroeconomic risks resulting from the narratives.
> Future work could expand the range of scenarios input into the NiGEM model to improve the tool development process in Task 5.1.
> 
> WP5: Adaptation policy development
> WP5 will translate results from WPs 2, 3, and 4 into an easy-to-use, flexible tool, ready for use by groups like HMT. The main goals of this tool are (1) the ability to quickly explore new scenarios of domestic and trade-related risks; (2) the ability to propose and analyse adaptation investment plans; and (3) the production of sectoral and macroeconomic impacts that can be input into models like NiGEM for further analysis.
> 
> Task 5.1: Co-develop a flexible tool: The flexible tool will take the form of a sophisticated spreadsheet, incorporating @RISK Monte Carlo simulations. It would include (1) the projection scenarios produced in WP1, with the ability to adjust their assumptions; (2) the emulated relationships produced in WP2 for multiple bottom-up risks; (3) the trade spillover risks produced by incorporating top-down risks from WP2 into macroeconomic modelling under WP4. It would also include options to design sophisticated adaptation scenarios, consisting of channel-specific investments. The process for updating risk relationships and adding new ones will be simple and clearly documented. The flexible tool would produce tables and figures, as well as damage estimates designed to be used with mapping tools and price changes to be input into NiGEM. The tool would be co-designed with HMT to ensure that it meets its needs now and in the future.
> 
> The project will also produce public data and interactive online maps describing (1) the spatial biophysical impacts and their associated economic damages; (2) global country-level GDP loss and associated uncertainty; (3) case study based fiscal risks from NiGEM and other outputs from the NiGEM model.
> Future work could engage a larger community of experts and stakeholders across the NGFS network in workshops and facilitate the tool’s uptake in other countries (O6). We could also incorporate a custom-calibrated AI to translate narrative scenarios into quantitative inputs appropriate for exploration within the tool.
> 
> Task 5.2: Propose and analyse adaptation policies: This task would explore a range of policies, including both hard adaptation (e.g., infrastructure investment) and soft adaptation (e.g., disclosure, stress testing). Using the tool, some of these policies evaluated within a benefit-cost framework, to help the UK government maximise the returns from investments in adaptation policy and to understand where vulnerable groups can be best supported by existing adaptation options and where new adaptation options are needed.
> Future work could develop explicitly optimise across the adaptation options included in the flexible tool under multiple budget constraints, to provide clearer policy advice.
> 
> Grant Outputs and Key Performance Indicators:
> The main output products of this work are:
> ●	A flexible open-source tool to evaluate sectoral impacts and trade spillovers.
> ●	A public data product and interactive visualisation tool of high-resolution UK impacts, global macroeconomic impacts, and case-study fiscal impacts.
> ●	Two briefings for policymakers that synthesise (1) key UK insights and (2) globally-relevant contributions for NGFS and its members.
> Future work could generalise the tool and adapt improved data products for a larger stakeholder community, as informed by co-design workshops.

> # Introduction to the Economic and Fiscal Risks of Climate Damage and Benefits of Adaptation Action Project
> 
> ## Overview
> 
> Climate change poses pressing economic and fiscal challenges to the UK, impacting both short-term financial stability and long-term prosperity. Our project seeks to address these challenges by developing comprehensive UK-specific climate damage scenarios. These scenarios will aid in informing fiscal policies and adaptation strategies, supporting the UK's path towards sustainability and resilience.
> 
> Our endeavours build upon previous studies, such as those by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), while addressing their limitations in specificity and complexity. By integrating sector-specific impacts into a cohesive macroeconomic framework, we aim to enable evidence-based policy decisions and advance our understanding of adaptation benefits and costs.
> 
> ## Objectives
> 
> The project is structured around several core objectives:
> 1. **Enhance Understanding of UK Macroeconomic Impacts:** Provide insights into the macroeconomic effects of climate change, considering international spillovers and adaption costs.
> 2. **Advance Quantification of Fiscal Risks:** Ensure a robust understanding of fiscal impacts due to climate damages and adaptation expenditures.
> 3. **Inform Public Spending on Adaptation:** Guide funding decisions through evidence-based insights to maximise adaptation benefits.
> 4. **Facilitate Adaptive Decision-Making:** Develop a flexible framework that incorporates new data and insights as they become available.
> 5. **Foster a Community of Experts:** Convene a diverse group of experts to improve risk assessments and support policy-making.
> 
> ## Approach
> 
> We will adopt a hybrid modelling approach, leveraging state-of-the-art UK sector models and incorporating them into macro-models like NiGEM. Key activities include:
> - Developing climate and socioeconomic scenarios aligned with global warming levels (2°C, 3°C, and 4°C) and specific tail risks (such as AMOC collapse).
> - Conducting bottom-up and top-down economic risk assessments, incorporating adaptation components.
> - Synthesising findings into a flexible tool for real-time analysis and policy guidance.
> 
> ## Expected Outcomes
> 
> The project's critical deliverables include:
> - An open-source tool for evaluating sectoral impacts and trade spillovers.
> - Public data products and visualisation tools to depict high-resolution impacts across the UK and globally.
> - Policy briefings that provide key insights for UK-specific and international audiences.
> 
> ## Governance and Collaboration
> 
> Led by James Rising in collaboration with the Grantham Research Institute at LSE, this project will engage a multidisciplinary advisory group comprising representatives from HMT, OBR, Defra, and other key institutions. Through regular meetings and communications, the group will ensure alignment with strategic goals and ongoing policy relevancy.
> 
> ## How You Can Contribute
> 
> As a valued member of the advisory group, your expertise and insights are crucial to our success. We encourage active participation, open dialogue, and regular feedback to optimise our strategies and outputs. Your engagement will help shape effective climate-responsive policies that benefit the UK and set a precedent for similar international efforts.
