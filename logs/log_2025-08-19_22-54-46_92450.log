> In python, I have a list of strings. I want to return the 5 longest strings. How can I?
**assistant**:
> To find the 5 longest strings in a list, you can use Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which allows you to sort by the length of the strings. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```python
> # Sample list of strings
> strings = ['apple', 'banana', 'strawberry', 'kiwi', 'watermelon', 'grape', 'pineapple']
> 
> # Sort the list by the length of the strings, in descending order, and slice the first 5
> longest_five = sorted(strings, key=len, reverse=True)[:5]
> 
> print(longest_five)
> ```
> 
> This code sorts the strings in descending order based on their lengths and then selects the first 5 strings from this sorted list. The `key=len` argument tells `sorted()` to use the string length as the sorting criteria. The `reverse=True` argument sorts the strings from longest to shortest.
