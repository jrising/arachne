> Write a song for Camilo from Encanto, in the style of Lin Manuel Miranda. It should mainly be sung by Camilo, but with interactions with his family members (e.g., Mirabel), coming to a deeper understanding of himself. Start by stating when the song takes place, curing the movie.

> Song title: "Shifting Shapes, Steadfast Heart"
> Setting: This song takes place during the movie Encanto, after the scene where the magical candle starts to flicker and the family realizes the magic is in danger. Camilo and the family members come together to understand the importance of unity and individuality in preserving their magical heritage.
> 
> [Verse 1: Camilo]
> I've been changing forms, like a chameleon's dance,
> Trying to find myself in this enchanting trance,
> But as the magic weakens, I can feel it in my heart,
> A fear that grows inside me, as our world falls apart.
> 
> [Pre-Chorus: Camilo]
> I've been hiding behind faces, not knowing who I am,
> In this world of shifting colors, I search for where I stand.
> 
> [Chorus: Camilo]
> But as the shapes keep shifting, my heart stays the same,
> A steadfast light that flickers, with the magic in my veins.
> No matter the appearance, I'll find the strength to shine,
> In this family of magic, united we'll entwine.
> 
> [Verse 2: Mirabel]
> Camilo, don't you see, you've always had the key,
> You've brought laughter to our hearts, and light to our family.
> Your gift is more than magic; it's the power to be free,
> In a world that's ever-changing, you'll always be our tree.
> 
> [Bridge: Camilo & Mirabel]
> Camilo: I've always looked at others, trying to fit in,
> Mirabel: But don't forget your beauty lies in your own skin.
> Together: In this journey of discovery, we'll find our true light,
> A love that can't be shattered, with our family we'll unite.
> 
> [Verse 3: Family]
> Each of us unique, yet bound by magic's thread,
> Our power comes from unity, from bonds we've always had.
> With love, we'll stand together, as one we'll face the night,
> For in this world of wonder, we find our greatest light.
> 
> [Chorus: All]
> And as the shapes keep shifting, our hearts stay the same,
> A steadfast light that flickers, with the magic in our veins.
> No matter the appearance, we'll find the strength to shine,
> In this family of magic, united we'll entwine.
> 
> [Outro: Camilo]
> No more hiding behind faces, I'm ready to embrace,
> The true essence of who I am, in every form and place.
> With love, we'll keep the magic, in our hearts it shall remain,
> For in this family of wonders, together we'll sustain.
