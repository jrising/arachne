**assistant**:
> There are several creative solutions for funding work on building codes, especially those aimed at promoting sustainability and energy efficiency:
> 
> 1. **Green Bonds:** Green bonds are fixed-income securities designed to raise funds for sustainable projects. These could include creating or renovating buildings to be environmentally friendly, such as with energy efficiency improvements or renewable energy installations.
> 
> 2. **Carbon Credits:** Projects that result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions can generate carbon credits. These credits can be sold on the international market, providing an additional source of funding.
> 
> 3. **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):** Governments and private businesses can work together to fund sustainable building code projects. The government can provide tax incentives or subsidies, while businesses provide the remaining funding.
> 
> 4. **Crowdfunding and Community Shares:** These are platforms where individuals or groups can contribute financially to a project in their community. It's a democratic way of fundraising where the people who care about a project the most, fund it.
> 
> 5. **Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs):** Under an EPC, an energy service company designs and implements energy savings projects, and uses the savings achieved to pay for the project. This is a cost-effective way for organizations who can't afford upfront costs to upgrade their buildings.
> 
> 6. **Revolve Funds:** These are "evergreen" funds where initial investments are recycled into new projects as soon as they are repaid, allowing for continuous investment in sustainability projects.
> 
> 7. **Development Impact Bonds (DIBs):** With DIBs, private investors provide upfront financing for development projects, and donors or governments repay the investors based on the achievement of agreed-upon outcomes.
> 
> 8. **Social Impact Bonds (SIBs):** Similar to DIBs, SIBs are contracts with public sector authorities, where it commits to pay for improved social outcomes that result in public sector savings.
> 
> 9. **Lottery and Grants:** Lotteries and Grants specifically designated to support sustainability initiatives can be a source of funding for building codes too.
> 
> 10. **Volunteer services or time-banking:** In community projects, services could be offered by volunteers and repaid by time credits. This reduces costs and strengthens community bonds.
> 
> Different models might work better in different contexts, so it would be valuable to consider a mixed funding approach that optimizes the advantages of each.

> Continuous improvement in the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), working towards the goal of net-zero new construction.
> Alignment of commercial energy codes with Building Performance Standards. 
> Adoption of the latest version of the codes, achieved by equipping state and local governments and their communities with the necessary resources to advocate for and implement stronger building energy codes.
> Federal agencies who oversee and support the design, construction, and/or financing of new homes and buildings have the information and tools necessary to support the requirement of more efficient new construction.
> Examples of Recent and Ongoing Work
> 
> Adoption Toolkit, Part I and Part II: Energy codes and the process by which they are developed and adopted are notoriously confusing and subject to gatekeeping. The Toolkit makes energy codes more accessible by breaking down what the energy code does, how it is developed, and how to get involved in adoption processes.
> Community Codes (in progress): Energy codes and BPS coincide with many of the issues at the center of community-based organization’s missions, including housing affordability and energy burden, but the connections are not always clear or well understood by those impacted. This resource seeks to help individuals and local agencies understand how the energy code affects daily life, and enable community actors to leverage their unique experience to impact code development and adoption processes. 
> BPS-Codes Primer (in progress): A brief, easy to understand resource that gets government agencies thinking about the overlap between codes and BPS - including inter-departmental communication needs, policy goal alignment, compliance, and enforcement. 
> Providing energy code expertise to the Campaign for Lower Home Energy Costs, an initiative that calls on FHFA to require that mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac meet the latest energy codes, in line with requirements recently adopted by HUD.
> We must act NOW to build a better future

> In order to continue to work towards better buildings for everyone, we need your help. Planned areas of intervention and associated funding needs are as follows:
> 
> Committee seat on the IECC Residential Consensus Committee. IMT, like many of our peers, is frustrated by the ICC Board’s decision to remove significant measures from the 2024 IECC, going against the recommendations of the IECC Committees and ICC staff. While we explore alternative options, we recognize that it is critical to remain at the table, and not cede the future of the code to those who wish to limit it. IMT plans to apply for a committee seat, as well as petition ICC to expand the participant categories to be more inclusive and reach out to potential members who are also interested in seeing a more progressive code. As part of this process, IMT will continue to coordinate with peers on the creation and introduction of new code language. 
> Co-lead Codes-BPS TAG for National Energy Codes Collaborative. The National Energy Codes Collaborative is a nationwide network working with states and jurisdictions to support the equitable implementation of updated building energy codes. The Collaborative facilitates technical advisory groups (TAG) to provide leadership and strategic direction, connect stakeholders, provide technical assistance and peer review new resources. IMT co-leads the Codes-BPS TAG, leveraging the organizations' nationally-recognized BPS thought leadership and long history of building energy code advocacy to provide expert guidance in support of energy code/BPS alignment and long term success.
> Contribute to the scoping and development of the next version of ASHRAE 100. ASHRAE 100, a code-ready BPS providing criteria to reduce energy consumption and GHG emission in existing buildings, has the potential to be a powerful tool to align energy codes and BPS. The recent 2024 edition expanded the standard to include building decarbonization and more building types, but further collaboration can strengthen the applicability of this standard to more locations and compliance circumstances.
> Track and intervene in local and state activity. While many jurisdictions, motivated by federal funding and climate goals, are passing policies to ratchet up building energy requirements, that is not true everywhere. Building decarbonization will continue to be a contentious topic for the foreseeable future; monitoring legislation related to energy codes and BPS allows IMT to influence these activities by sharing supportive resources where needed and engaging corporations and industry groups that can take direct action."

The importance of strong energy codes will only grow as climate change increases the rate of severe weather events and the cost of energy. However, continued resistance to adopting stronger codes as well as the challenges obstacles faced in the code development process put these gains at risk.
> Stronger energy codes are a foundational component of decarbonization strategies but alone are insufficient to meet aggressive climate action goals. New buildings make up a small proportion of the built environment; efforts to achieve an efficient, affordable, decarbonized, and resilient building stock must be inclusive of existing buildings as well, necessitating a holistic approach. Building Performance Standards (BPS) are a powerful tool that can help meet this need by requiring existing buildings to meet energy or greenhouse gas emissions-based performance targets, but more work needs to be done to harmonize traditional energy codes with this new outcome-based approach to achieve a seamless holistic solution to improving building performance
