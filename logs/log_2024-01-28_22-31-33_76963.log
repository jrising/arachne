**user**:
> I have N distributions, characterized by their several quantile values (only their quantiles-- I do not have other information about them). I would like to construct a mixture distribution from these. If each distribution is equally weighted in the mixture, can I calculate the resulting quantiles?
**assistant**:
> Since each of the N distributions only have quantile information available, constructing the mixture distribution by simply combining these quantiles won't produce accurate results. There's no straightforward way to mathematically merge quantiles from different distributions and get the quantiles for the mixture distribution. This is mainly because a mixture distribution is not defined by a simple sum or average of the distributions it is made up from.
