> 1. **Market Demand and Speculative Activity**: The rising demand for coffee, especially in emerging markets, led to increased prices. Furthermore, increased speculative activity in commodities also played a considerable role in driving up prices.

In particular, Colombia suffered from excessive rains due to the La NiÃ±a weather phenomenon, which significantly reduced its coffee output. Additionally, in 2011, Brazil faced a drought, negatively affecting its crop yield.
> 
> 3. **Costs of Inputs**: The rising costs of key inputs, such as fuel and fertilizers, increased production costs, leading to hikes in coffee prices.
> 
> 4. **Political Circumstances**: Instability and conflict in many coffee-producing regions, such as certain parts of Africa, impacted the consistent supply of coffee, contributing to the rise in prices.
