**user**:
> In flask, how do I make a template where I would optionally send in an argument. If the argument is there, it should be rendered, and otherwise not?
**assistant**:
> Here is a way you can use optional arguments in Flask templates. We'll be utilizing Jinja2, the template engine of Flask, which features control flows, including conditionals that allow handling optional arguments.
> 
> Let's say, for example, you want to optionally display a welcome message. Below is an illustration of how to do this:
> 
> 1. **In your Flask route, have an optional argument:**
> 
> ```python
> @app.route('/')
> def home():
>     # Maybe we calculate welcome_msg here, but maybe we have None
>     welcome_msg = "Hello, world!"
>     return render_template('home.html', welcome_msg=welcome_msg)
> ```
> 
> You can create this variable conditionally.
> 
> 2. **In your Jinja2 template, check if the argument exists before using it:**
> 
> ```jinja2
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
> <head>
>     <title>Home Page</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     {% if welcome_msg %}
>     <p>{{ welcome_msg }}</p>
>     {% endif %}
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> 
> The code checks if `welcome_msg` is not None. If `welcome_msg` exists, its value will be displayed in the `<p>` tag. 
> 
> Remember to pass the argument to the `render_template` function even if it is `None`. If you don't pass anything to the `render_template`, you would get an error because the variable wouldn't be defined in the context of the template.
> 
> Also remember not to use `is not None` in the Jinja2 template. For Jinja2, an undefined variable is truly undefined, not `None`.
**user**:
> Is there a way to allow welcome_msg to be either given (by some routes) and not given (not even as none) by others?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can allow the `welcome_msg` argument to be optionally given by some routes and not given at all by others. Here's how you can achieve that:
> 
> 1. **When calling `render_template`, only include `welcome_msg` if it is provided**:
> 
> ```python
> @app.route('/')
> def home():
>     # Some logic to determine whether to include welcome_msg or not
>     welcome_msg = "Hello, world!"  # Optional welcome_msg
>     return render_template('home.html', welcome_msg=welcome_msg)
> 
> 
> @app.route('/about')
> def about():
>     # Don't provide welcome_msg
>     return render_template('about.html')
> ```
> 
> In the `home` route, you include the `welcome_msg` argument if you have one. In the `about` route, you simply don't include the `welcome_msg` argument.
> 
> 2. **In your Jinja2 template, handle the absence of `welcome_msg`**:
> 
> ```jinja2
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
> <head>
>     <title>Home Page</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     {% if welcome_msg is defined %}
>     <p>{{ welcome_msg }}</p>
>     {% else %}
>     <p>Welcome!</p>
>     {% endif %}
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> 
> The Jinja2 template code first checks if `welcome_msg` is defined. If it's defined, its value will be displayed in the `<p>` tag. If it's not defined, a default welcome message or any other content can be displayed instead.
> 
> Using this approach, you can have routes where the `welcome_msg` argument is included, and routes where it's not included at all, providing the flexibility you need.
