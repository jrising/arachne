**assistant**:
> This error occurs when there is a version compatibility issue between the `statsmodels` and `pandas` packages. The version of `statsmodels` you are using seems to be expecting a different version of `pandas`. 
> 
> Here are a few steps you could try to resolve the issue:
> 
> 1. **Update both packages:**
>    Often, this type of import error comes from an outdated version of one of the libraries. It's possible that updating both statsmodels and pandas will resolve the problem. You can update Python libraries with the following commands:
>    ```python
>    pip install --upgrade pandas
>    pip install --upgrade statsmodels  
>    ```
> 2. **Install a Specific Version of Pandas:**
>    If updating the libraries doesn't fix the issue, you can also try downgrading the pandas version to an older one that might be compatible with the current statsmodels version you have installed.
>    ```python
>    pip
