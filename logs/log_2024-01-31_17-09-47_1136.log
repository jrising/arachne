> How do you control the order of facets in a facet_wrap in ggplot?
**assistant**:
> In ggplot, the order of facets generated by `facet_wrap()` is typically based on the factor level of the faceting variable. If you want to control the order of the facets, you need to adjust the factor levels of the faceting variable.
> 
> Assuming your faceting variable is `variable_name`, here are the basic steps to do it in R:
> 
> 1. Within your dataframe, relevel the factor levels of your faceting variable.
> ```R
> df$variable_name <- factor(df$variable_name, levels = c("level1", "level2", "level3"))
> ```
> You would replace `"level1"`, `"level2"`, `"level3"` with the specific level names you want in the order you want the facets to appear.
> 
> 2. After changing the factor levels, plot the graph using `facet_wrap()`. The order of levels you set for the faceting variable will now dictate the order of the facets in ggplot.
> 
> Here is a full example, supposing your faceting variable is `var` and you want levels to appear in order of `"C"`, `"B"`, `"A"`.
> ```R
> df$var <- factor(df$var, levels = c("C", "B", "A"))
> ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x_name, y = y_name)) + 
>   geom_point() +
>   facet_wrap(~var)
> ```
> This would display your facets in the order of `"C"`, `"B"`, `"A"`.
