> I want to release a dataset that contains third-party data that is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license. What constraints does that place on the licenses that I can release my dataset under?
**assistant**:

> 
> If you are incorporating third-party data that is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license, you must release your dataset under a compatible license. This means that you must release your dataset under a license that has the same or a more permissive license as the original data.
> 
> In particular, you must make sure that your license allows others to share, remix, and use your dataset for non-commercial purposes, as specified by the original license. This means that you cannot release your dataset under a license that permits commercial use, or that has more restrictive terms than the original license.
> 
> One example of a compatible license is the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license, which allows others to share and remix your work for non-commercial purposes, as long as they give you credit. Another option is the Open Data Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license, which has similar terms but is specifically designed for datasets.
> 
> It's important to carefully review the terms of both the original license and any license you are considering for your dataset to ensure compatibility. Additionally, it's a good practice to clearly label your dataset with information about the original data source and the license terms to ensure proper attribution and compliance with the license.

> Could I release my dataset under a GNU GPL license?
**assistant**:
> Releasing a dataset under a GNU GPL license when it contains third-party data licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license may not be compatible with the original license terms. 
> 
> The GNU GPL license allows for commercial use, which is not allowed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license. Therefore, releasing your dataset under a GNU GPL license would be more restrictive than the original license terms and could potentially create conflicts with the license requirements of the original data.
> 
> A more compatible option would be to release your dataset under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license or another license that is compatible with the original license terms. This would ensure that others can use and share your dataset for non-commercial purposes while also complying with the terms of the original license.

> It's important to carefully review the terms of the original license and any license you are considering for your dataset to ensure compatibility and compliance. Additionally, providing clear information about the original data source and the license terms can help ensure proper attribution and compliance with the license.
**user**:
> My product contains data under both the Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported and Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International licenses. Which of these licenses could I use for my product?
**assistant**:
> If your product contains data under both the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported and Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International licenses, you can choose to release your product under either one of these licenses, as long as you comply with the terms of both licenses.
> 
> However, it's important to note that these two licenses have some differences in their terms, so you will need to carefully review and understand the specific terms of each license before making your decision.
> 
> For example, the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license has more explicit language around the definition of "NonCommercial use" than the Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported license. Additionally, the 4.0 version allows for adaptations of the licensed material to be shared under the same license, whereas the 3.0 version allows adaptations to be shared under a different license.
> 
> To ensure compliance with both licenses, you will need to clearly identify which parts of your product are licensed under which version of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license and provide appropriate attribution to the original data sources.
> 
> It's important to carefully consider the specific needs of your product and the needs of your users when choosing a license. You may want to consult with legal counsel or a licensing expert to ensure that your use of the licensed data is in compliance with both licenses and any other relevant legal requirements.
