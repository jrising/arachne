> In a document, I had previously written that "Significant disagreements existing between these disciplines [climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics]" because these groups have very different ideas of what we should do about climate change. But disagreement sounds too non-academic. I currently have "Significant divergences in perspectives existing between these disciplines, requiring concerted interdisciplinary consensus-building to move forward." But I'm not sure of the grammar. Can you advise?

> Your grammar is largely correct, but the sentence could be slightly more concise and clear. Here is a suggested revision:
> 
> "Significant divergences exist in the perspectives of these disciplines, necessitating concerted interdisciplinary consensus-building for progress."

> In this revision, the verb "exist" directly follows the subject "divergences", making the sentence clearer. Also, replacing "to move forward" with "for progress" simplifies the expression without changing your original meaning.
