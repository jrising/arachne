> Can I add a "counter" to a google docs document? I have a bunch of figures in the doc and I want it to automatically fill in the figure number (1, 2, 3, ...) based on the order in the file.
**assistant**:
> Google Docs doesn't have a built-in feature for automatic counters or sequential numbering of items like figures. However, there are a few approaches you can consider:
> 
> 1. **Use an Add-on**: There are Google Docs add-ons designed for more advanced document automation that might offer this capability. One popular add-on is *Doc Variables*, which can sometimes be adapted to implement counters. Check the add-on store to see if there's an option tailored for auto-numbering figures.
> 
> 2. **Use Google Apps Script**: If you're comfortable with a bit of scripting, you can write a Google Apps Script to automate this task. Here's a basic script outline that increments a counter for each figure:
> 
>    ```javascript
>    function numberFigures() {
>      var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();
>      var body = doc.getBody();
>      var paragraphs = body.getParagraphs();
>      var counter = 1;
>      
>      for (var i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++) {
>        var text = paragraphs[i].getText();
>        if (text.startsWith("Figure: ")) {
>          var newText = "Figure " + counter + ": " + text.substring(8);
>          paragraphs[i].setText(newText);
>          counter++;
>        }
>      }
>    }
>    ```
> 
>    This script looks for paragraphs that start with "Figure: " and replaces them with "Figure 1: ", "Figure 2: ", etc., incrementing the number as it goes. To use it, go to Extensions > Apps Script, paste the script, and run it.
> 
> 3. **Manual Bookmarking**: If scripting and add-ons are not an option, you can use bookmarks manually. Insert a bookmark at each figure and manually number them as you go. While not automated, this can help keep track of changes more reliably than manually editing each number.
> 
> If none of these options work due to organizational restrictions, consider maintaining a separate, numbered list of figures in the document for reference. This keeps the document organized and allows for easy updating when figures are added or removed.
