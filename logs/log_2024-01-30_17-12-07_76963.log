**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Commercial fishing effort - Vessel Trip Report (VTR)” as a data gap. Here is the discussion in Dewberry Engineers 2018:

> Data Description:

> VTRs are used to record and document catch landed by licensed fishermen. Data that are released are in a summary or aggregate form, so as to not reveal the identity of the fisherman. VTR data collected from fishermen include vessel name, date, trip type, number in party, gear used, area fished, average depth, species caught, amount kept, amount discarded, date sold, state and port landed, and date landed.

> The Mid-Atlantic region contracted with Rutgers University to do an analysis of VTR data to show what ports fishermen came from, not just the locations of fishing areas. The analysis required considerable stakeholder vetting, but if NOAA could perform such an analysis it would be helpful for other states’ Federal Consistency Reviews. However, because of the differences in regions, the same methodology may not be applicable elsewhere without additional stakeholder engagement. The Mid-Atlantic methodology may be applicable in the Southeast, but not likely on the West Coast.
> 					
> The currently available VTR data in the South Atlantic are out of date. Heat maps are available but newer data are needed. Alaska relies on fish surveys, which are costly and are not being done as frequently (every 2 – 3 years now), yet conditions are changing more rapidly.
> 					
> VTR data only include commercial fishing in the Pacific Islands, fish types are not accurate for Hawaii, and the VTR data are spotty for American Samoa and Guam.
> 					
> As with VMS data, recreational fishing data are needed in particular, including locations and type of fish, as well as shore based access locations for recreational fishing at a national scale.

> Can you summarize this material, citing these sources, with a view toward data gaps relevant to Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process?
**assistant**:
> Sure, the existing information points to data gaps in several key areas that may impact the spatial planning process for Delaware's ocean and bay areas, particularly regarding the use of Vessel Trip Report (VTR) data for understanding commercial fishing efforts. Here's a summary.
> 
> Reflecting on Dewberry Engineers (2018), VTRs serve a crucial role in documenting catches landed by licensed fishermen. The data collected, which respect the confidentiality of fishermen by being released in summary or aggregate form, include diverse aspects ranging from vessel names, trip types, gear used, areas fished, species caught, dates and ports of landing, among others. However, several key issues could be better addressed with improved data. 
> 
> For instance, data improvements could better facilitate:
> 
> - Offshore aquaculture siting
> - Fisheries management (managing fishing quotas, assessing fishery stock, managing protected species, economic analysis, developing fisheries management strategies, managing impacts to the fishing industry, conflict reduction between different uses, determining fishing activity and value, and identifying landing locations)
> - Community resilience and climate adaptation
> - Offshore renewable energy siting and leasing (minimizing impacts to fishing activities and species & habitat management)
> - Maritime and navigation safety
> - Permitting and siting for other offshore infrastructure (such as energy and telecommunications cables)
> 
> The Mid-Atlantic region has undertaken analyses of VTR data to evaluate which ports fishermen hail from, rather than merely the locations of fishing areas. Although invaluable, these analyses require considerable stakeholder vetting and may not be applicable to other regions without further stakeholder engagement. Unfortunately, the VTR data currently available in the South Atlantic are out of date, and the data for the Pacific Islands only include commercial fishing. Recreational fishing data, particularly locations and types of fish, along with shore-based access locations for recreational fishing at a national scale, are notably lacking.
> 
> Echoing Trice et al. (2021), processing and publishing data derived from VTRs is carried out by regional partners at significant cost and effort. To address this, annual agency-sponsored products are needed in more regions. To define appropriate planning products, consultations with the Fisheries Management Council (FMC), regional experts, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are necessary. Improvements are also needed in the consistency and completeness of original codes, documentation, and products interpolated at a spatial resolution that would support energy and aquaculture leasing. Furthermore, data on recreational fishing, including the location, type of fish caught, and shore-based access location, are needed.
> 
> The above illustrates the identified data gaps - in both the collection, processing, and utilization of the VTR data - and how they can impact maritime spatial planning decisions, including Delaware's ocean and bay areas. Closing these data gaps could support improved decision making in these crucial areas (Dewberry Engineers, 2018; Trice et al., 2021).
