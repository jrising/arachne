> I am looking for a movie that I remember from childhood. It was a movie about ancient egypt, and the main plot was about a scheming woman who wants to be pharaoh (possibly ruling through her consort), and she orchestrates the existing pharaoh's death. But the movie ends with her trapped in the dead pharaoh's tomb, as his whole government is buried with him. What was it?

> The movie you're thinking of is "Land of the Pharaohs" from 1955. This Howard Hawks film, set in Ancient Egypt, features Joan Collins as the manipulative Princess Nellifer, who marries the Pharaoh Khufu (played by Jack Hawkins) with plans to rule Egypt. The iconic ending sees her trapped in the Pharaoh's pyramid tomb. The film is well known for its grand depiction of pyramid construction.
