**user**:
> In terms of the most imports into the US, what kinds of transport are used?
**assistant**:
> In terms of imports into the US, various modes of transportation are used depending on the nature of the goods and the distance involved. The primary modes of transportation for imports include:
> 
> 1. Ocean Freight: Ocean shipping is the most common method for importing goods into the United States. Large cargo ships transport goods in containers, commonly known as container shipping. This transport mode is suitable for bulky, non-perishable, and non-urgent goods that can withstand longer transit times.
> 
> 2. Air Freight: Air transport is preferred for high-value and time-sensitive imports. It offers faster transit times compared to ocean shipping but is generally more expensive. Air freight is commonly used for perishable goods, time-critical products, or items requiring special handling.
> 
> 3. Trucking: Once goods arrive at US ports or airports, trucking plays a crucial role in transporting them to their final destinations. Trucks are used for both short-distance and long-distance inland transportation, providing flexibility and accessibility to various regions.
> 
> 4. Rail Freight: Rail transportation is commonly utilized for long-distance haulage of goods. It is efficient for moving large volumes of goods between the coast and inland locations. Rail is often used to transport commodities such as coal, minerals, and raw materials.
> 
> It's worth noting that the choice of transportation mode depends on factors such as speed, cost, distance, nature of goods, and logistical considerations. Many import supply chains involve a combination of these modes to optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
**user**:
> What is their relative share of imports?
**assistant**:
> In terms of the relative share of imports, the majority of goods imported into the United States are transported by sea (ocean freight). According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, around 71% of total U.S. import value in 2020 was transported by ocean vessels.
> 
> Air freight accounts for a smaller but significant share of imports, accounting for approximately 16% of the total import value. Air transportation is generally used for higher-value, time-sensitive, and perishable goods.
> 
> Trucking plays a vital role in the distribution of imported goods within the United States. While specific data on the share of trucking in imports is not readily available, it is a key mode of transportation for moving goods from ports and airports to distribution centers and retailers across the country. Trucking is often used for shorter distances but can cover long-haul journeys as well.
> 
> Rail freight transportation, while important for certain types of imports such as bulk commodities, does not have as significant a share as ocean freight, air freight, or trucking in terms of the overall volume of goods imported into the United States.
> 
> It's essential to note that the relative shares of these modes can vary depending on factors such as the type of goods being imported, geographical location, and global trade dynamics.
