> 
> Dear Board members,
> 
> This brief guideline is meant to assist you with your holiday card and impact report distribution packets. Your packet contains the following items and instructions on how to use them effectively:
> 
> 1. **Holiday Cards**: Personalized holiday cards have been prepared for each recipient in your network. We encourage you to hand-write a personal message thatâ€™s intimate and unique to the recipient. This delicate touch will help foster more profound connections.
> 
> 2. **Pre-printed Address Labels**: These labels have the names and addresses of the intended recipients. Please affix the correct label to each envelope carefully, ensuring that the card's receiver is marked on the respective envelope.
> 
> 3. **Impact Report**: Attached to each card is our annual Impact Report. This report outlines our major achievements and future endeavors in the context of our mission. We hope that by sharing these successes, the receiver will realize the power of their continued support.
> 
> 4. **Return Envelopes**: For your ease, return envelopes are included in the packet too. If you would like to encourage any of your contacts to make a donation or to respond, kindly add the return envelope to your outgoing mail. 
> 
> Here's a step-by-step guide to assembling your packets:
> 
> 1. Cross-verify the addressee mentioned on the pre-printed address label with the holiday card to make sure you're matching the correct card with the intended receiver.
> 2. Place the annual Impact Report in the holiday card.
> 3. Handwrite a personal message on the holiday card.
