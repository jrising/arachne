> The following is a description of key parameters in a model:
> ===
> Model
> component
> Description Key parameter Description
> Opinion The opinion component models the dynamics of public
> opinion on climate policy through changes in the fraction of
> the population falling into one of three groups: supportive,
> neutral or opposed to climate policy. Movement between
> groups depends on social conformity (people tend towards
> opinions common in their social group) and can, depending
> on parameter values, also be affected by
> (1) observation of climate change (through the climate
> change perception feedback);
> (2) policy changes (through the expressive force of law
> feedback); and (3) adoption behaviour (through the
> credibility-enhancing display feedback).
> Network homophily The tendency of the population to preferentially affiliate with
> groups with similar opinions87–89. High network homophily
> means that groups with different opinions are less likely
> to come into contact with each other, causing divergence
> between policy opinions across the population and within
> a typical individual’s social network.This parameter also
> defines the social network structure within the adoption
> component.
> Persuasive force The strength of the social-conformity effect.
> Evidence effect How strongly perceived climate change affects climate
> policy opinion.
> Policy–opinion effect The strength of the expressive force of law feedback.
> Credibility-enhancing
> display effect
> The strength of credibility-enhancing display feedback,
> which modifies the persuasive force for climate policy
> supporters that adopt individual pro-climate behaviour.
> Adoption The adoption component models the fraction of each
> opinion group adopting a single, representative pro-climate
> behaviour. Adoption depends on adoption cost and a desire
> to conform to typical behaviour within the social network
> (that is, a social-conformity feedback). Adoption cost can
> be lowered by policy and can also include an endogenous
> cost-reduction feedback (that is, more adopters decreases
> adoption cost). Adoption can also be influenced by opinion
> on climate policy.
> Social-norm effect The strength of the influence of social norms on
> adoption decisions. The social network depends on the
> network-homophily parameter in the same way as in the
> opinion component.
> Opinion-adoption
> effect
> A parameter that describes how climate policy opinion
> affects adoption. Greater values make climate policy
> supporters more likely, and policy opposers less likely, to
> adopt for a given adoption cost.
> Endogenous technical
> change effect
> The endogenous technical change effect controls how
> adoption costs fall with increased adoption.
> Policy-adoption effect How changes in climate policy affect adoption costs.
> Policy The policy component models collective climate change
> action through a single stock variable representing an
> effective carbon price (or subsidy for negative values). The
> change in policy each period depends on the distribution of
> climate policy opinion in the population.
> Status quo bias The tendency of political institutions to maintain the status
> quo90. Higher values require larger majorities in favour of a
> policy change before policy responds and slows the rate of
> change. The effect is symmetric for increases and decreases
> in the carbon price.
> Political interest
> feedback
> The strength of the political interest feedback, in which past
> policy change modifies the status quo bias parameter to
> make future change easier or harder. Can be a balancing
> feedback (that is, past changes in one direction make future
> change in that direction harder) or a reinforcing feedback.
> Emissions The emissions component models reductions in emissions
> from an RCP7 no-policy baseline as a function of climate
> policy and individual adoption. Emissions under RCP7
> are higher than expected given current climate policies,
> but are a more central estimate of no-policy emissions
> trajectories than the ‘worst-case’ RCP8.5 scenario91. Policy
> is allowed to produce persistent (that is, cumulative)
> emissions reductions consistent with changes to
> long-lived capital, while individual adoption produces
> non-cumulative emissions reductions. The component
> allows for an endogenous technical change feedback for the
> policy-induced mitigation. The policy component is assumed
> to represent the OECD and the rest of the world follows the
> same emissions-reduction path with some time lag (that
> is, consistent with principles of common but differentiated
> responsibility in international climate agreements).
> Emissions are further affected by warming levels through the
> temperature-emissions feedback.
> Maximum mitigation
> rate and time
> Cumulative, policy-induced mitigation is modelled
> as a contemporaneous drop in emissions that decays
> exponentially over time. Both the initial drop and the rate of
> decay increase with more stringent climate policy. These
> parameters cap the maximum value that they can take as
> policy increases, in the absence of the learning-by-doing
> feedback.
> Learning-by-doing
> effect
> The learning-by-doing effect controls the strength of the
> endogenous cost-reduction feedback for policy-induced
> mitigation.
> Lag time This parameter controls the number of years lag between
> OECD policy change and the rest of the world. A value of 0
> enables the model to function as a single-region model.
> Adoption

> Effectiveness of individual pro-climate behaviour change in

> Feedback from warming to greenhouse gas emissions,

> Climate The climate model converts global greenhouse gas emissions into a change in global mean temperature. It is a simple three-box carbon cycle model
> (atmosphere, upper ocean and lower ocean) and two-box temperature model (atmosphere and ocean). The structure of the model is similar to that
> used in the DICE integrated assessment model92, but using annual time steps following Cai and Lontzek93. The climate model functions in the analysis
> only to input temperature change to the cognition component. As it is not of direct interest to the socio-politico-technical feedback processes
> analysed in this Article, climate model parameters are not varied in the analysis.
> Cognition The cognition component converts changes in temperature
> into perceived evidence for or against climate change.
> Weather anomalies in each time period depend on the
> climate and a random component based on the Earth’s
> natural climate variability. The component allows for two

> Biased-assimilation

> The strength of the effect that determines how perceived

**assistant**:
> Certainly! Let's categorize the key parameters from the model description into the specified "potential barriers" to implementing mitigation policy.
> 
> ### Technological
> These parameters relate to the ability to implement low-carbon technologies:
> - **Endogenous technical change effect:** Controls how adoption costs fall with increased adoption, reflecting technology improvement.
> - **Policy-adoption effect:** How changes in climate policy affect adoption costs, influencing technology deployment.
> - **Learning-by-doing effect:** Strengthens the endogenous cost-reduction feedback for policy-induced mitigation, promoting technological advancements.
> 
> ### Economic
> These parameters relate to the economic considerations and costs associated with low-carbon technologies:
> - **Adoption cost (within the Adoption component):** Directly affects willingness to adopt and reflects economic barriers.
> - **Policy-adoption effect:** Impacts how climate policies influence economic costs of adoption.
> - **Maximum mitigation rate and time:** Represents the economic feasibility of achieving certain levels of emissions reduction.
> 
> ### Social
> These parameters relate to public acceptance and social dynamics influencing policy adoption:
> - **Network homophily:** Describes tendencies in social networking that affect opinion divergence, influencing social acceptance.
> - **Persuasive force:** Reflects social conformity effects, impacting support for climate policies.
> - **Social-norm effect:** Represents the influence of social norms on behavior, crucial for public acceptance.
> - **Opinion-adoption effect:** Describes how climate policy opinions affect individual adoption choices.
> - **Biased-assimilation effect:** Relates to cognitive biases in understanding climate change, affecting social perception.
> 
> ### Institutional/Policy
> These parameters relate to the challenges in implementing policies:
> - **Status quo bias:** Reflects institutional resistance to change, a key policy barrier.
> - **Political interest feedback:** Influences institutional momentum for policy changes.
> - **Lag time:** Represents delays in international policy adoption, affecting policy effectiveness.
> - **Policy–opinion effect:** Demonstrates how policies themselves can elicit changes in public opinion, influencing policy sustainability.
> 
> This categorization helps in identifying focal points for addressing barriers in the implementation of effective climate mitigation policies.
