**user**:
> I am upgrading an old version MediaWiki. After the upgrade, I can still see my content in the `wiki_content` table, but all of the pages show up as "There is currently no text in this page." This is even the case with my single orphaned page-- it's name shows up on the orphaned pages list, but none of the content shows. How can I fix this?
**assistant**:
> This issue could be due to several reasons. Here are some suggestions on how to fix it:
> 
> 1. **Check for the correct $wgDBprefix in LocalSettings.php:** If your database setup includes a prefix, it should be set correctly in the `$wgDBprefix` in your `LocalSettings.php`.
> 
>     ```php
>     $wgDBprefix = "<your_prefix>";
>     ```
> 
> 2. **Run the update script:** Your database may be lacking some of the newer tables that were added in the upgrade. Run `php maintenance/update.php` from your MediaWiki root directory.
> 
> 3. **Check the 'revision' and 'text' tables:** The `page_latest` field in the `page` table should have the ID of the latest page revision which is housed in the `revision` table. The `rev_text_id` from this latest revision should match an entry in the `text` table. That entry should have the correct `old_text` in wiki markup language which is the content of your page. Make sure that the `old_flags` field in this same entry includes `utf-8`.
> 
> 4. **Check MySQL permissions:** Ensure that the user specified in `LocalSettings.php` has sufficient permissions. The user should be granted the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER permissions.
> 
> 5. **Check $wgReadOnly setting:** If this is set in LocalSettings.php, it could cause the "no text" error. Be sure to comment this out if present.
> 
>     ```php
>     #$wgReadOnly = 'Some maintenance going on'; //Commented out
>     ```
> 
> 6. **Purge the cache:** MediaWiki can cache pages, and purging can sometimes help bring back missing content: 
> 
>     - In your browser: You can append `?action=purge` to the end of the URL. 
>     - Via the command line: Use `php maintenance/refreshLinks.php`.
> 
> 7. **Check $wgLegacyEncoding setting:** If your wiki was using a different character set before UTF-8, make sure `$wgLegacyEncoding` is set correctly.
> 
>     ```php
>     $wgLegacyEncoding = "<your_previous_charset>";
>     ```
>     
> I would suggest taking a backup of your database before attempting these steps.
**user**:
> Okay, I see the right connection from the page table to the revision table to the text table. One oddity is that I see that the text table has its id column named "old_id". Could that be related?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the column name in the `text` table being labeled as "old_id" instead of the expected "id" could be the root of the issue. In MediaWiki, the `text` table should have a column named "old_id" to store the unique identifier for each text entry.
> 
> To address this issue, you'll need to update the column name in the `text` table to "id" so that it matches the expected structure of MediaWiki. Here's how you can do this:
> 
> 1. **Backup your database:** Before making any changes, it's crucial to take a backup of your database to ensure that you can revert to a working state if needed.
> 
> 2. **Access your database:** Use a MySQL client or tool such as phpMyAdmin to access your MediaWiki database.
> 
> 3. **Rename the column:** Execute the following SQL query to rename the "old_id" column in the `text` table to "id":
> 
>     ```sql
>     ALTER TABLE text
>     CHANGE COLUMN old_id id INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL auto_increment,
>     ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
>     ```
> 
>    This query renames the column from "old_id" to "id" and sets it as the primary key.
> 
> 4. **Verify the changes:** After executing the query, verify that the column name has been successfully changed by checking the structure of the `text` table.
> 
>    You can use the following SQL query to display the table structure:
> 
>     ```sql
>     DESCRIBE text;
>     ```
> 
>    Confirm that the column name has been updated to "id" and that it is set as the primary key.
> 
>    Once the column name has been corrected, the pages should display the associated content correctly.
> 
> Remember to test the changes thoroughly to ensure the functionality of your MediaWiki installation. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know.
