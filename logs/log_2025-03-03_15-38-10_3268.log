> I have a sparse matrix in dgCMatrix format in R. I want to find out which columns have non-zero values in a given row, without translating the row into a dense vector. I see I can get out the values from this row by saying `transmat@p[transmat@i == ii - 1]`.

> To find out which columns have non-zero values in a specific row of a sparse matrix in `dgCMatrix` format, you can use the `j` slot of the sparse matrix to identify the column indices. Here's a concise way to achieve what you want:
> 
> ```r
> # Assume `transmat` is your sparse matrix and `ii` is the index of the row you're interested in
> # Remember that R uses 1-based indexing
> 
> # Get the range of indices in the `x` and `j` slots for the row of interest
> row_start <- transmat@p[ii]
> row_end <- transmat@p[ii + 1] - 1
> 
> # Extract the corresponding column indices from the `j` slot
> non_zero_columns <- transmat@j[(row_start + 1):row_end] + 1
> 
> # Output the column indices
> non_zero_columns
> ```
> 
> Make sure to adjust `ii` to be within the bounds of your matrix, and keep in mind that the `dgCMatrix` stores indices in 0-based format, which is why we adjust with `+1` for human-friendly output. This method will efficiently report the column indices with non-zero values in the specified row without converting anything to a dense format.

**assistant**:
> You're correct, and I apologize for the mistake. The `dgCMatrix` class has a different structure. To find out which columns have non-zero values in a specified row without converting the row to a dense vector, you can use the `p` and `i` slots effectively. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```r
> # Assume `transmat` is your sparse matrix and `ii` is the index of the row you're interested in
> 
> # Get the start and end indices for the row 'ii'
> start_index <- transmat@p[ii]    # Start index for the row
> end_index <- transmat@p[ii + 1]  # End index for the row
> 
> # Extract the column indices of non-zero entries in the given row
> non_zero_columns <- transmat@j[start_index:(end_index - 1)] + 1  # Adjust for 1-based index in R
> 
> # Output the column indices
> non_zero_columns
> ```

> This code will give you the column indices where there are non-zero values in the specified row of the sparse matrix without converting it into a dense vector. Thank you for your patience!
