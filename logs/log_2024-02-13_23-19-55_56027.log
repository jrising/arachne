**user**:
> What variables in a CGE model would I modify to represent a loss of productivity in agriculture under climate change?
**assistant**:
> To represent a loss of productivity in agriculture due to climate change in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, you would need to modify variables related to agricultural productivity, such as:
> 
> 1. **Total Factor Productivity (TFP):** Changes in climate could directly affect TFP in the agricultural sector, decreasing output even when all inputs remain constant. By lowering TFP, you decrease the overall efficiency of farming operations.
> 
> 2. **Labor productivity:** Higher temperatures or intensified weather events due to climate change can affect worker productivity in the fields. Implementing a climate effect on the labor productivity parameter could capture this.
> 
> 3. **Capital depreciation:** Extreme weather conditions like floods or droughts can damage farming equipment or infrastructure. An increased rate of capital depreciation would reflect this loss.
> 
> 4. **Land suitability or yield factors:** Alter the land suitability factor (or yield factor) to reflect changing crop yields due to alterations in rainfall patterns, temperature, radiation, and atmospheric CO2 concentration.
> 
> 5. **Input costs:** Costs of inputs may change due to availability, which can be affected by climatic conditions. Energy costs could increase due to higher temperatures, or water costs could increase due to shortages.
> 
> 6. **Adaptation costs:** The costs associated with adapting agriculture to new climate realities (like drought-resistant crop strains or more efficient irrigation systems) should also be factored into the model.
> 
> 7. **Trade parameters:** Climate change effects are not uniform over the globe. Some regions may experience agricultural gains while others suffer losses, leading to shifts in comparative advantage and trade patterns.
> 
> Remember that determining specific values for these variables under future climate scenarios would require integration with climate and crop growth models. The changes in these variables would depend on specific climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways - RCPs) and shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs).
**user**:
> GTAP has a variable "afeall". What is that?
**assistant**:
> In the GTAP model, the variable "afeall" refers to the "All-Factor Energy Productivity" measure. It represents the energy efficiency of production across all factors of production in the model.
> 
> More specifically, "afeall" is a measure of how much output can be produced from a given amount of energy input, taking into account all the factors of production together (labor, capital, land, and energy). It captures the overall energy efficiency of the economy represented in the GTAP model.
> 
> By modifying the "afeall" variable in the GTAP model, you can adjust the energy productivity of the economy, representing changes in energy efficiency or technological advancements that affect the amount of output that can be produced for a given level of energy consumption. This can be useful for assessing the impacts of energy-related policies or changes in energy technologies within the GTAP framework.
