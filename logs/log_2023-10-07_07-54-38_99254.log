**user**:
> When did the ship set sail in Moby Dick. I'm looking for a likely date.
**assistant**:
> "Moby-Dick; or, The Whale" by Herman Melville doesn't specify an exact date for the Pequod's departure, but some inferences can be made from the text and historical context.
> 
> Ishmael states in Chapter 1 that he always goes to sea as a sailor when he begins to grow "hazy about the eyes and begin to see things double". He appears to be experiencing the early symptoms of a New England winter, suggesting late fall. Secondly, he describes the inns being full of "labourers." Nantucket was a hub for the whaling industry, so it's plausible these could be whalers preparing for the winter season.
> 
> The whaling season usually began in October or November as whales migrate to warmer waters. Since the book was written in the early 1850s, and it's not stated otherwise, it could be inferred that the Pequod might have left Nantucket in late fall or early winter.
> 
> However, since an exact date is not given, this remains speculation based on the contextual clues from the book and historical facts.
**user**:
> When did Ishmael set out from his home (in New York)?
**assistant**:
> In "Moby-Dick," Ishmael mentions leaving his home in New York to journey to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he plans to join a whaling voyage. The book doesn't specify an exact date for Ishmael's departure from New York. However, in Chapter 2, Ishmael mentions walking to New Bedford and arriving on a Saturday evening. The following day, Sunday, he attends church and then seeks lodging. These details suggest that Ishmael likely left New York a day or two before arriving in New Bedford, placing his departure from New York in the few days prior to that Saturday evening. Unfortunately, the novel does not provide a more precise date for Ishmael's departure from his home in New York.
**user**:
> Is there any hint from the weather in the book about his time in New Bedford or Nantucket?
**assistant**:
> In "Moby-Dick," the book doesn't provide explicit details about the weather during Ishmael's time in New Bedford or Nantucket. However, there are some general descriptions and hints throughout the novel that can be interpreted.
> 
> When Ishmael arrives in New Bedford, he mentions a "gray-headed old sexton" tolling the bells in a "hard, freezing cold," suggesting that the weather was chilly during that time.
> 
> As for Nantucket, once Ishmael arrives there, he states, "It was a Nantucket ship, the ‘Town-Ho,’ that years afterward took my good friend, Robert Stanard, on his whaling voyage." This suggests that Nantucket is known for its whaling ships and indicates that whaling activity occurs there regularly.
> 
> While the novel doesn't provide specific weather details for Ishmael's time in New Bedford or Nantucket, the overall tone and context suggest a cold climate consistent with the regions' weather patterns during the fall and winter seasons.
> 
> It's worth noting that weather details in "Moby-Dick" are often used to set the mood and atmosphere rather than provide precise meteorological information.
