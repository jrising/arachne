> For data on the total produced (non-natural) capital by country, you can explore the following sources:
> 
> 1. **World Bank's Wealth Accounting**: The World Bank provides comprehensive data on produced capital as part of their "Wealth Accounting" efforts. You can explore their reports and databases, particularly the "Changing Wealth of Nations" series, which includes data on natural, human, and produced capital.
> 
> 2. **OECD's Wealth Statistics**: If you are interested in OECD member countries, the OECD provides data on national wealth, including produced capital. Their "National Accounts" section might be particularly useful.
> 
> 3. **UN System of National Accounts**: The United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) provides guidelines and data on national accounting, including produced capital. Though they don't provide country-level data directly, they offer methodologies and frameworks used by countries in their reporting.
> 
> 4. **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**: Occasionally, the IMF provides working papers and reports that address issues of capital accumulation by country, which may include produced capital.
> 
> 5. **National Statistical Offices**: Many countries' national statistical offices publish data on produced capital or fixed assets. Depending on your countries of interest, you might need to explore individual websites.
> 
> These sources can provide a good starting point, but it's worth noting that data granularity and definitions might vary, so careful attention to the metadata and methodology is essential. If you need help with accessing or understanding specific datasets, feel free to ask!
