**assistant**:
> Page contains an analysis of mitigation benefits, focusing on adaptation projects, particularly highlighting the sustainable agriculture, forestry, energy, and transportation sub-sectors. Sustainable or climate-smart agriculture projects reduce emissions mainly through soil and water conservation and more efficient technologies and management practices. Forestry projects enhance carbon sinks.
> 
> Energy projects contribute to emissions reduction by increasing the use of renewable energy sources. Both energy and transportation projects reduce emissions through efficiency gains. Figure eighteen illustrates the share of projects expected to reduce GHG emissions. Highlighting these significant emission reduction benefits and synergies makes adaptation more attractive for all parties involved in climate change adaptation planning and finance.
> 
> These projects align well with the IPCC’s two thousand twenty-two call for greater utilization of climate-resilient development pathways. Recognizing the potential mitigation co-benefits of adaptation can make adaptation investments more appealing to governments and donors pursuing both adaptation and mitigation goals as outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation Plans.
> 
> The eligibility of emissions reduction projects for carbon finance can also increase their appeal to the private sector looking for carbon finance opportunities.
> 
> Accompanying the text is a horizontal bar chart titled "Share of Projects that Reduce GHG Emissions." It shows the percentage of projects in different sectors contributing to GHG reduction. 
> 
> In Disaster Risk Management, the contribution is sixteen point seven percent. In Energy, eighty-five point seven percent of projects are GHG-reducing. In Forestry and Nature, it is eighty percent. Health projects contribute at four point eight percent. Resilient Cities have fifty-six point eight percent. Sustainable Agriculture contributes fifty-three point four percent. In Transport, sixty percent are GHG-reducing projects. Water Resources and Flood Management account for thirty-two point one percent, while Water Supply and Sanitation contribute thirty-three point three percent. Overall, forty-five point four percent of projects reduce GHG emissions.

> The Energy sector leads in GHG-reducing projects, and the Health sector ranks lowest.
