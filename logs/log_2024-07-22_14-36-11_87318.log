> Now I want to use that to select these rows from another matrix: `daygrow[valid, :]`, where daygrow is a 22841×20 Matrix. I expect a 910x20 matrix (there are 910 valid rows), but I get a 910x1 result. I think this is because the BixVector isn't being treated as a vector of booleans. How can I fix this?

> It looks like the issue is that `valid` is being interpreted as a `BitMatrix`, not a `BitVector`. To select rows from `daygrow` correctly, we need `valid` to be a `BitVector`.
