> The results of this study provide a baseline for comparison with others sectors in the state economy or with other coastal economies. If replicated on a regular basis it could also be used to monitor the development of the coastal economy over time. In that regard the whole study could be viewed as a “barometer” for the economic health of the coast. It might be desirable to have a simpler, more easily-executed barometer of coastal economy health. This study helps to identify the specific types of economic activity and the kinds of data that need to be collected to construct such a barometer. However, the fact remains that no single sector or activity can, by itself, capture the complexity and magnitude of the impacts of coast activity.
> 
> In addition, the study can be used to assist in economic development. For example, by clearly demonstrating the ways in which coastal economic activities contribute to the state economy, coastal community officials can more effectively make the case that such activities deserve resources to support infrastructure development.  Understanding the magnitudes of the contributions of coast-related activity can also be used to make better informed land-use decisions. The multiplier analysis also can assist planners in forecasting the ultimate magnitudes of the effects of new developments so that infrastructure can be appropriately sized.

> Please write up a section of a report which proposes such a tool, including the following points which flesh out my vision for it:
>  - The coastal economy is dynamic and can change rapidly, as a result of both internal forces and external changes.
>  - There are economic risks on coastal infrastructure and assets from flooding and sea level rise, on tourism from shifting behaviors, and on the natural environment from climate change.
>  - At the same time, there are economic opportunities, as demand increases for beautiful environments, and as businesses respond to the changing needs of an aging population.
>  - A healthy economy is one that is resilient to risk and prepared to take advantage of opportunities.
>  - Although the full range of risks and opportunities is difficult to enumerate, many of them are, and methods from sustainable development and inclusive accounting provide a firm basis for capturing the economic basis for future prosperity.
>  - Delaware’s coasts can benefit from a “Coastal Barometer”, providing a regularly updated dashboard of indices on the health of the coastal economy and its connections to the broader state and national economy.

> While the text should amount to a proposal, it should not say things like "we propose". Instead, it should lay out the principles and benefits of such a tool.

> Understanding the dynamism of the coastal economy is a prerequisite for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing economic potential. Inherent in its character are rapid changes propelled by both internal and external forces. To fully grasp this economic complexity, it is imperative to encapsulate these forces into a single measure. Hence, the conception of a "Coastal Barometer" is an important step towards gaining a holistic understanding of the coastal economy's health.
> 
> The coastal economy is subject to a spectrum of economic risks and opportunities. Infrastructure and assets are continually vulnerable to flooding and sea-level rise. Tourism, a vital sector, is subject to fluctuations due to shifting behaviors. Additionally, the natural environment faces mounting threats from climate change. However, within these challenges lie significant economic opportunities. As appreciation for beautiful environments escalates, and businesses adapt to the changing needs of an aging population, new avenues for growth become apparent.
> 
> Therefore, it is essential to realize that a healthy economy is not merely prosperous but resilient, armed to mitigate risks, and ready to seize the ensuing opportunities. The complexity of the coastal economy, laden with diverse risks and opportunities, makes it challenging to capture its entirety within a single metric. Yet, it is not an insurmountable task. The methodologies born from sustainable development and inclusive accounting offer a robust foundation for encapsulating the economic underpinnings of future prosperity.
> 
> A "Coastal Barometer" could serve as an invaluable tool for Delaware's coasts, offering a regularly updated dashboard of indices on the coastal economy's health. This tool wouldn't simply reflect the immediate condition of the coastal economy but would also elucidate its connections to the broader state and national economies. In essence, the Barometer would offer an integrated, up-to-date snapshot of the economy's overall health, spanning from the local to the national level.
> 
> The proposed Coastal Barometer is more than a mere statistical index; it is a pathway towards comprehensive economic understanding. By making these data readily available, coastal community officials will be better equipped to support infrastructure development and make more informed land-use decisions. Understanding the scale of the contributions from coastal-related activities also helps planners forecast the effects of new developments more accurately, ensuring that infrastructure is appropriately sized.
> 
> Thus, the Coastal Barometer serves as a critical instrument, not only monitoring the pulse of the coastal economy but also guiding its future, making it a potential cornerstone of sustainable and inclusive development for Delaware.
