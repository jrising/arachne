> In ggplot, can I do a plotting command like geom_line, but then have it not draw anything (just adjust the axes as needed)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use `geom_blank` in ggplot2. The `geom_blank` function is essentially a 'do nothing' geometric object. Its primary use is for adjusting the scale or limits of a plot, as it computes the range of your data without creating any graphic elements.

> Here is an example:
> 
> ```r
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Example data
> df <- data.frame(x = c(1:10), y = c(1:10))
> 
> # Plotting
> ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
>   geom_blank() + 
>   theme_minimal()
> ```
> 
> In this plot, nothing is drawn, but the axes have been adjusted to the range of the x and y data provided. By using `geom_blank()`, the x-axis resolves from 1 to 10, and so does the y-axis.
**user**:
> How can I also remove the associated legend item? I have an aes(colour="label") for that particular geom_line/geom_blank.
**assistant**:
> To remove the legend associated with a specific aesthetic mapping in ggplot2, you can use the `guide` argument within the corresponding `geom_` function. You can set `guide = FALSE` to suppress the legend for that specific aesthetic mapping.

> Here's an example using `geom_line` with a color legend that you want to remove:

> ```r
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Example data
> df <- data.frame(x = c(1:10), y = c(1:10), label = "line_label")
> 
> # Plotting with geom_line and color legend
> p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = label)) +
>   geom_line() +
>   theme_minimal()
> 
> # Suppressing the legend for the 'label' aesthetic mapping
> p + guides(colour = FALSE)
> ```
> 
> In this example, we first create a basic plot with a color legend for the 'label' aesthetic mapping. Then, using the `guides()` function with `colour = FALSE`, we remove the color legend associated with the 'label' aesthetic mapping.
