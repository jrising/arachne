> I think I saw this in a style guide at some point, but I can't find it now, and I'm being told to always put the punctuation inside no matter what. Does my practice have any basis?
**assistant**:
> Yes, your practice does have a basis, and it's all about geographic style differences. In American English, the conventional style is to place periods and commas inside the quotation marks, while the question marks and exclamation points follow the logical order (i.e., they go inside the quotation marks if they're part of the quote, and outside if they're not).
> 
> However, in British English, your practice is indeed the normâ€”known as "logical punctuation" or "British style". In this style, all punctuation marks follow the logic of being inside the quotation marks if they're part of the quoted material and outside if they're not. For example, the British style would have:
> 
> 1. He said, "Don't go into the river."
> 2. These are called "rivertides".
> 
> The American style, on the other hand, would always place the period within the quotation marks:
> 
> 1. He said, "Don't go into the river."
> 2. These are called "rivertides."
> 
> Your style is especially preferred in technical and scientific writing, where precision is critical, and the placement of punctuation could alter the interpreted meaning of the quoted material. 
> 
> While consistency is key, take into account where your work is being published and what style guide they use. In America, for example, the Chicago Manual of Style and the American Psychological Association (APA) guide follow the American convention, while the Modern Language Association (MLA) leans toward the British style.
