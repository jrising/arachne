> I just got a new property assessment from the city (not based on an actual visit). The new value is up almost 10% from last year, which will increase my property taxes accordingly. Although my area is gentrifying, this seems pretty extreme. When is it appropriate to object? Should I just accept this?
**assistant**:
> It's definitely worth evaluating the new property assessment carefully, especially with such a significant increase. Here are some steps you might consider:
> 
> 1. **Review the Assessment**: Look over the details provided in the assessment report. Make sure all the information like property size, type, number of rooms, and any improvements or damages are accurately represented.
> 
> 2. **Research Comparables**: Look at the assessment values of similar properties in your area to see if yours aligns with them. This will help determine if the new value seems reasonable within the market context.
> 
> 3. **Check for Errors**: Ensure there are no clerical or factual errors in your assessment. Mistakes do happen, and correcting those could immediately adjust your valuation.
> 
> 4. **Understand Local Real Estate Trends**: Since your area is gentrifying, there may be justifiable reasons for the increase. However, it can still be worthwhile to talk to a local real estate agent or professional to understand if the increase is typical or excessive.
> 
> 5. **Review Local Rules**: Every city has a different procedure for disputes. Check your local tax assessor's office for guidelines on how to appeal the assessment and the deadline to do so.
> 
> 6. **File an Appeal**: If, after reviewing, you believe the new value is unjustified, you can file an appeal. You'll typically need to provide evidence, like the comparables and corrections, to support your case.
> 
> While it might seem convenient just to accept the increase, challenging it could save you a substantial amount of money in property taxes if the assessment is indeed inaccurate. It's definitely worth considering an appeal if you have evidence that suggests the assessment was too aggressive or based on incorrect information.
