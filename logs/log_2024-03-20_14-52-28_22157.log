> I see a table of Kaya identity growth terms in the IPCC, but while there are all the ones I know (Carbon intensity, Energy intensity, GDP/pop., and Pop.), there is also "Energy cons.", which I don't know and doesn't seem necessary for understanding the total. What is this?
**assistant**:
> The "Energy cons." term in the Kaya identity stands for "Energy consumption." It refers to the total energy consumed by a society or nation, usually represented in units such as terawatt hours (TWh) or petajoules (PJ).
> 
> The Kaya identity itself is an equation that expresses carbon dioxide emissions as a product of four factors:
> 
> Carbon dioxide emissions = Population * (GDP / Population) * (Energy / GDP) * (Carbon dioxide / Energy)
> 
> However, it seems the table you're looking at has chosen to add this extra term for "Energy Consumption." This could be for several reasons, such as:
> 
> 1. They wanted to emphasize the raw amount of energy being consumed, regardless of its carbon intensity.
> 2. The table might include this term as a reference or ratio denominator for the other factors.
> 
> In practical terms, it doesn't change the fundamental aspect of the Kaya identity, but provides additional context to the variables involved.
> 
> Please note that exact definitions can vary between reports, so it might be useful to check the report's glossary or methodology section to see exactly how "Energy cons." is defined.
