> I agreed to babysit for a gold fish for a few weeks, and while I had it I got it a proper tank. Now I'm trying to give it back and I got the answer, "This is your fish now!" I don't want it, but it's okay. I want to respond with something half-heartedly appreciative-- not to make them feel bad, but not to suggest that they're doing me any favor. What would you suggest? This is just over text, by the way, so it should be super short.

> How about: "Haha, guess I'm a fish owner now! 🐟"How about replying with: "Well, it's hard to argue with fate! 🐟 Thanks for luring me into the fishy life!" This keeps it light and humorous, without making it sound like you're overly thrilled or blaming them.
