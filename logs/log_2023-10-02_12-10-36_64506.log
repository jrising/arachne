> income and environmental quality will be determined by how many parties react to economic growth and its side effects—including citizens, businesses, policymakers, regulators, nongovernmental organizations, and other market participants. A body of recent research has investigated these connections. The theme that emerges from this research is that it is quite plausible for developing societies to have improvements in environmental quality. It also seems likely that because of growing public concern and research knowledge about environmental quality and regula- tion, countries may be able to experience an environmental Kuznets curve that is lower and flatter than the conventional measures would suggest. That is, they may be able to develop from low levels of per capita income with little or no degradation in environmental quality, and then at some point to experience improvements in both income and environmental quality.
> The Primary Role of Environmental Regulation
> In principle, observed changes in pollution as per capita income rises could come from several different sources: shifts in the scale and sectoral composition of output, changes in technology within sectors, or the impact of regulation on pollution abatement (Grossman and Krueger, 1993). The absence of appropriate microdata across countries has precluded a systematic empirical approach to this decomposition. However, the available evidence suggests that regulation is the dominant factor in explaining the decline in pollution as countries grow beyond middle-income status.
> For instance, Panayotou (1997) estimates a decomposition equation for a sample of 30 developed and developing countries for the period 1982–1994. He incorporates policy considerations into the income-environment relationship while decomposing it into scale, sectoral composition and pollution intensity (or pollu- tion per unit of output) effects. His main finding, at least for ambient sulfur dioxide levels, is that effective policies and institutions can significantly reduce environ- mental degradation at low income levels and speed up improvements at higher income levels, thereby lowering the environmental Kuznets curve and reducing the environmental cost of growth. However, the estimated equation is not derived from any formal structural equation. In addition, in the absence of actual measures of environmental regulation, Panayotou uses indices of contract enforcement and bureaucratic efficiency as proxies. De Bruyn (1997) decomposes the growth- environment relationship in a sample of OECD and former socialist economies, using a divisia index methodology. Analyzing changes in sulfur dioxide pollution, he finds a significant role for environmental policy, but not for structural change in the economy. In a cross-country study of water pollution abatement, Mani, Hettige and Wheeler (2000) find that while some of the improvement in water quality with increases in per capita income is attributable to sectoral composition and technology effects, the main factor is stricter environmental regulation.
> There appear to be three main reasons that richer countries regulate pollution more strictly. First, pollution damage gets higher priority after society has com- pleted basic investments in health and education. Second, higher-income societies have more plentiful technical personnel and budgets for monitoring and enforce-

> ment activities. Third, higher income and education empower local communities to enforce higher environmental standards, whatever stance is taken by the national government (Dasgupta and Wheeler, 1997; Pargal and Wheeler, 1996; Dean, 1999). The result of these mutually reinforcing factors, as shown in Figure 2, is a very close relationship between national pollution regulation and income per capita (Das- gupta, Mody, Roy and Wheeler, 2001).
> Economic Liberalization
> During the past two decades, many countries have liberalized their economies by reducing government subsidies, dismantling price controls, privatizing state enterprises and removing barriers to trade and investment. Easterly (2001) pro- vides strong evidence that measures of financial depth and price distortion have improved significantly for developing countries since 1980. The result has been an adjustment toward economic activities that reflect comparative advantage at undis- torted factor and product prices, which in turn can affect the level of pollution in an economy by shifting the sectoral composition.
> One result has been growth of labor-intensive assembly activities such as garment production. These activities are seldom pollution-intensive, although there are some notable exceptions such as electronics assembly that employs toxic cleaning solvents and fabric production that generates organic water pollution and toxic pollution from chemical dyes (Hettige, Martin, Singh and Wheeler, 1995). Another likely area of comparative advantage is information services with relatively low skill requirements, such as records maintenance for internationally distributed information-processing services. Such activities are typically not very polluting. More environmentally sensitive areas of comparative advantage include large-scale agriculture and production that exploits local natural resources such as forest

> products, basic metals and chemicals (Lee and Roland-Holst, 1997). These indus- tries are often heavy polluters, because they produce large volumes of waste residuals and frequently employ toxic chemicals.
> Elimination of government subsidies often has an environmentally beneficial effect in this context. The heaviest polluters often receive subsidies, because they operate in sectors such as steel and petrochemicals where state intervention has been common. Privatization and reduction of subsidies tend to reduce the scale of such activities, while expanding production in the assembly and service sectors that emit fewer pollutants (Dasgupta, Wang and Wheeler, 1997; Lucas, Hettige and Wheeler, 1992; Jha, Markandya and Vossenaar, 1999; Birdsall and Wheeler, 1993). Elimination of energy subsidies increases energy efficiency, shifts industry away from energy-intensive sectors, and reduces demand for pollution-intensive power (Vukina, Beghin and Solakoglu, 1999; World Bank, 1999). However, higher energy prices also induce shifts from capital- and energy-intensive production techniques to labor- and materials-intensive techniques, which are often more pollution- intensive in other ways (Mani, Hettige and Wheeler, 2000).
> Economic liberalization also has a common effect, at least in pollution- intensive sectors, of enlarging the market share of larger plants that operate at more efficient scale (Wheeler, 2000; Hettige, Dasgupta and Wheeler, 2000). This change often involves a shift toward publicly held firms at the expense of family firms. The improvement in efficiency means less pollution per unit of production, although larger plants may also concentrate pollution in a certain locality (Lucas, Dasgupta and Wheeler, 2001). In China, state-owned enterprises have much higher costs for reducing air pollution because they are operated less efficiently. Figure 3 displays recent econometric estimates of control costs for sulfur dioxide air pollu- tion in large Chinese factories (Dasgupta, Wang and Wheeler, 1997).1
> The level of polluting emissions also reflects managers’ technology decisions. In the OECD countries, innovations have generated significantly cleaner technol- ogies that are available at incremental cost to producers in developing countries. Even in weakly regulated economies, many firms have adopted these cleaner technologies because they are more profitable. Increased openness to trade also tends to lower the price of cleaner imported technologies, while increasing the competitive pressure to adopt them if they are also more efficient (Reppelin-Hill, 1999; Huq, Martin and Wheeler, 1993; Martin and Wheeler, 1992). Thus, firms in relatively open developing economies adopt cleaner technologies more quickly (Birdsall and Wheeler, 1993; Huq, Martin and Wheeler, 1993).
> While liberalization can certainly improve environmental conditions, it is no panacea. The evidence suggests that in a rapidly growing economy, the effect of lower pollution per unit of output as a result of greater efficiency is generally
> 1 Xu, Gau, Dockery and Chen (1994) have shown that atmospheric sulfur dioxide concentrations are highly correlated with damage from respiratory disease in China. Sulfur dioxide and other oxides of sulfur combine with oxygen to form sulfates and with water vapor to form aerosols of sulfurous and sulfuric acid. Much of the health damage from sulfur dioxide seems to come from fine particulates in the form of sulfates.

> overwhelmed by the rise in overall pollution as a result of rising output (Beghin, Roland-Holst and van der Mensbrugghe, 1997; Dessus and Bussolo, 1998; Lee and Roland-Holst, 1997). Thus, total pollution will grow unless environmental regula- tion is strengthened (Mani, Hettige and Wheeler, 2000).
> Pervasive Informal Regulation
> Low-income communities frequently penalize dangerous polluters, even when formal regulation is weak or absent. Abundant evidence from Asia and Latin America shows that neighboring communities can strongly influence factories’ environmental performance (Pargal and Wheeler, 1996; Hettige, Huq, Pargal and Wheeler, 1996; Huq and Wheeler, 1992; Hartman, Huq and Wheeler, 1997). Where formal regulators are present, communities use the political process to influence the strictness of enforcement. Where regulators are absent or ineffective, nongovernmental organizations and community groups—including religious insti- tutions, social organizations, citizens’ movements, and politicians—pursue infor- mal regulation. Although these pressures vary from region to region, the pattern everywhere is similar: Factories negotiate directly with local actors in response to threats of social, political or physical sanctions if they fail to compensate the community or to reduce emissions.
> The response of factories can take many forms. Cribb (1990) cites the case of a cement factory in Jakarta that—without admitting liability for the dust it generates—“compensates local people with an ex gratia payment of Rp. 5000 and a tin of evaporated milk every month.” Agarwal, Chopra and Sharma (1982) describe a situation where, confronted by community complaints, a paper mill in India installed pollution abatement equipment—and to compensate residents for remaining damage, the mill also constructed a Hindu temple. If all else fails, community action can also trigger physical removal of the problem. In Rio de Janeiro, a neighborhood association protest against a polluting tannery led man- agers to relocate it to the city’s outskirts (Stotz, 1991). Mark Clifford (1990) has
> 
> 156 Journal of Economic Perspectives
> reported in the Far Eastern Economic Review that community action prevented the opening of a chemical complex in Korea until appropriate pollution control equipment was installed. Indeed, communities sometimes resort to extreme mea- sures. Cribb (1990) has recounted an Indonesian incident “reported from Banjaran near Jakarta in 1980 when local farmers burned a government-owned chemical factory that had been polluting their irrigation channels.”
> Such examples are not limited to developing countries, of course. They also play an important role in the work of Coase (1960), who called traditional regula- tion into question by noting that pollution victims, as well as regulators, can take action if they perceive that the benefits outweigh the costs. Of course, the victims need information about pollution risks to take appropriate action. In most cases, such information can only be gathered by public authorities that have a legal mandate to collect it. We will return to this issue in our discussion of public disclosure as a new regulatory instrument in developing countries.
> Pressure from Market Agents
> Market agents can also play an important role in creating pressures for environmental protection. Bankers may refuse to extend credit because they are worried about environmental liability; consumers may avoid the products of firms that are known to be heavy polluters.
> The evidence suggests that multinational firms are important players in this context. These firms operate under close scrutiny from consumers and environ- mental organizations in the high-income economies. Investors also appear to play an important role in encouraging clean production. Heavy emissions may signal to investors that a firm’s production techniques are inefficient. Investors also weigh potential financial losses from regulatory penalties and liability settlements. The U.S. and Canadian stock markets react significantly to environmental news, gener- ating gains from good news and losses from bad news in the range of 1–2 percent (Muoghalu, Robison and Glascock, 1990; Lanoie and Laplante, 1994; Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; Hamilton, 1995; Lanoie, Laplante and Roy, 1998). One recent study found that firms whose bad environmental press has the greatest impact on stock prices subsequently reduce emissions the most (Konar and Cohen, 1997). Similar effects of environmental news on stock prices have been identified in Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Philippines (Dasgupta, Laplante and Mamingi, 2001). In fact, the market responses in these countries are much larger than those reported for U.S. and Canadian firms: Stock price gains average 20 percent in response to good news and losses range from 4 –15 percent in the wake of bad news.
> Multinationals have responded to such factors. A recent study of 89 U.S.-based manufacturing and mining multinationals with branches in developing countries found that nearly 60 percent adhere to a stringent internal standard that reflects OECD norms, while the others enforce local standards (Dowell, Hart and Yeung, 2000). Controlling for other factors such as physical assets and capital structure, the study found that firms with uniform internal standards had an average market value $10.4 billion higher than their counterparts. Indeed, multinational firms operating in low-income economies are often environmentally friendlier than domestically

> owned firms. For example, a careful audit of Indonesian factories undertaken in 1995 found that almost 70 percent of domestic plants failed to comply with Indonesian water pollution regulations, while around 80 percent of the multina- tional plants were fully compliant (Afsah and Vincent, 1997).
> Better Methods of Environmental Regulation
> Poor countries with weak regulatory institutions can reduce pollution signifi- cantly by following a few basic principles. The first is focus. In many areas, relatively few sources are responsible for most of the pollution (Hettige, Martin, Singh and Wheeler, 1995; World Bank, 1999). Therefore, emissions can be significantly reduced by targeting regulatory monitoring and enforcement on those dominant sources.
> Notable inroads against pollution have also been made where environmental agencies in developing countries have begun moving away from traditional command-and-control policies toward market-oriented forms of regulation. Pollu- tion charges have proven feasible in developing countries, with successful imple- mentation in China (Wang and Wheeler, 1996), Colombia, Malaysia and Philip- pines (World Bank, 1999). In Colombia, for example, the recent implementation of water pollution charges in the Rio Negro Basin reduced organic discharges from factories by 52 percent during the program’s first year of operation. No participat- ing factory seems to have experienced financial difficulties in the process (World Bank, 1999). A pollution charge program in the Laguna Bay region of Philippines reduced organic pollution by 88 percent during its first two years of operation (World Bank, 1999). Similar conclusions have emerged from studies of regulation and control costs in Malaysia ( Jha, Markandya and Vossenaar, 1999; Khalid and Braden, 1993).
> Better Information
> Until recently, relatively little was known about the economic damage associ- ated with pollution in developing countries. During the past few years, however, economic analyses have repeatedly shown that large cities in developing countries suffer very high costs from pollution, even when damage is evaluated at conserva- tive estimates of local opportunity costs (Dasgupta, Wang and Wheeler, 1997; Von Amsberg, 1997; Calkins, 1994). Such evidence has induced rapid strengthening of pollution control in the large cities of China, Brazil, Mexico and other developing countries.
> This improved information combines with pressures from citizens, govern- ment, nongovernmental organizations and market agents to create pressures for rapid enactment of stricter environmental regulations. Strong results have also been obtained by programs that provide accessible public information about polluters, pollution damages, local environmental quality and the cost of pollution abatement. Such programs significantly improve the ability of local communities to protect themselves, the ability of national regulators to enforce decent environmental standards, and the ability of market agents to reward clean firms and punish heavy polluters.

> International institutions such as the World Bank have begun supporting this idea in collaborative programs with environmental agencies in Indonesia, Philip- pines, China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and elsewhere.2 In Indonesia and Philippines, pilot public disclosure programs have reduced emissions from hundreds of large water polluters by 40–50 percent during a two-year period (Afsah and Vincent, 1997; World Bank, 1999). After the success of a pilot public disclosure program in two Chinese cities, the approach is now being extended to an entire province, Jiangsu, with a population of approximately 100 million.

> In this excerpt from "Confronting the Environmental Kuznets Curve" by Dasgupta et al. (2002), the authors discuss how the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality is not fixed and can be influenced by various factors. They highlight the role of different parties such as citizens, businesses, policymakers, regulators, and NGOs in shaping this relationship. The authors also emphasize the importance of environmental regulation in driving improvements in pollution levels, particularly in middle- and high-income countries. They provide examples of empirical studies that show the significant impact of regulation on reducing pollution and lowering the environmental cost of growth.

Market agents such as bankers, consumers, and multinational firms can also exert pressure for environmental protection.

It emphasizes the role of information in driving stronger environmental regulations and protecting communities. The authors provide examples of successful programs that provide accessible public information about polluters, pollution damages, and the cost of pollution abatement, leading to significant emissions reductions and improved environmental standards.

> Overall, the paper argues that the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality is not predetermined but can be influenced by various factors, including environmental regulation, economic liberalization, informal regulation by communities, and pressures from market agents. It underscores the potential for developing societies to achieve improvements in environmental quality and experience an environmental Kuznets curve that is lower and flatter than conventional measures suggest, but emphasizes the need for robust environmental governance and regulation to achieve this.
