> Can you provide a code example of how to build up a dataframe row by row in a loop? There will be both numeric and string values across the columns.
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can show you how to do that in Python, using the `pandas` library. Here's an example:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # Initialize an empty DataFrame
> df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Column1', 'Column2', 'Column3'])
> 
> # Loop for creating rows and adding to DataFrame
> for i in range(5):
>     # Create a new row
>     new_row = {'Column1': i, 'Column2': 'value'+str(i), 'Column3': i**2}
>     # Append the row to the DataFrame
>     df = df.append(new_row, ignore_index=True)
> 
> print(df)
> ```
> 
> In this code:
> 
> - An empty DataFrame `df` with columns 'Column1', 'Column2', and 'Column3' is initialized.
> - A loop is then run 5 times. In each iteration, a new row (`new_row`) is created as a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are the desired values for each column.
> - The `append()` function is used to add `new_row` to `df`. The argument `ignore_index=True` allows the index to reassign automatically after each row is added.
> 
> Please keep in mind that appending to a DataFrame row-by-row using a for loop can be highly inefficient for large data sets, as `pandas` needs to recreate a new DataFrame with the old and new data at each iteration. It's usually more efficient to create a list of dictionaries and then create a DataFrame in a single step.

> AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'append'
**assistant**:
> It seems that you are using a newer version of pandas where the `append` method for DataFrames has been deprecated. You can achieve the same result by using the `concat` function instead. Here's the modified code snippet:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # Initialize an empty DataFrame
> df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Column1', 'Column2', 'Column3'])
> 
> # Loop for creating rows and adding to DataFrame
> for i in range(5):
>     # Create a new row
>     new_row = {'Column1': i, 'Column2': 'value'+str(i), 'Column3': i**2}
>     # Append the row to the DataFrame
>     df = pd.concat([df, pd.DataFrame(new_row, index=[0])], ignore_index=True)
> 
> print(df)
> ```
> 
> In this updated code:
> - We use `pd.concat` to concatenate the existing DataFrame `df` with a new DataFrame created from the `new_row` dictionary. 
> - The `index=[0]` argument in `pd.DataFrame` ensures that the new row DataFrame is created with index 0, so that it aligns with the index of the existing DataFrame during concatenation.
> - The `ignore_index=True` argument is used to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame after concatenation.
> 
> This should work without the `'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'append'` error.
