**user**:
> Is there a tidyverse approach to reading CSV files? I usually just use read.csv.
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is a tidyverse approach to reading CSV files. It's done using the `readr` package, which is part of the tidyverse collection of packages.
> 
> The corresponding function to `read.csv` in `readr` is `read_csv`. Here's an example of how you use it:
> 
> ```R
> library(readr)
> 
> data <- read_csv("path/to/your/file.csv")
> ```
> 
> The `read_csv` function in `readr` is generally faster and more user-friendly than the basic `read.csv`. For instance, `read_csv` will automatically parse dates and factors, and you don't need to worry about stringsAsFactors. It also displays a progress bar for larger files.
