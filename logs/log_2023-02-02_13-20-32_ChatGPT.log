> When computing Conley standard errors for a time series model, it is important to choose appropriate spatial and temporal cut-offs to ensure the accuracy and validity of the results. Some best practices for choosing these cut-offs include:
> 
> 1. Spatial cut-off: Choosing an appropriate spatial cut-off is important to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. A common method is to use a Moran's I test to determine the optimal spatial cut-off distance.
> 
> 2. Temporal cut-off: Temporal cut-off should be chosen based on the temporal autocorrelation in the data. A common method is to use an autocorrelation function (ACF) plot to determine the optimal temporal lag.
> 
> 3. Balancing spatial and temporal cut-offs: The spatial and temporal cut-offs should be chosen in a way that balances the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability. A too small cut-off can result in overfitting, while a too large cut-off can lead to a loss of detail in the model.

> It is important to consider the specific context and the goals of the analysis when choosing these cut-offs, as the optimal values may vary between different studies and datasets.
