> I am preparing my external dossier for tenure review, and I would like edits to improve the text as well as the identification of any gaps. I will provide the sections of this one-at-a-time. This is a section of my Service Statement.
> 
> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."
> 
> Second, here is a peer's statement for comparison:
> ---
> To the University:  I have served on the Executive Committee of the EPM masters program since I began at UC Davis, which oversees issues of curriculum, finances, and program development. EPM is a new program that began admitting students in 2017. It has grown substantially over the last 5 years, from an initial cohort of just 6 in 2017 to an incoming cohort of over 35 in 2021. In 2016-2017 I led the process for submitting new classes for the core curriculum for approval from the University. I have served on the Admissions Committee of the EPM program once and chaired the Admissions Committee once. 
> I have twice served on faculty search committees and am currently serving on the university fellowship committee, reviewing applications from graduate students for university fellowships.
> To the Profession: Since fall 2016 I have performed 51 peer reviews of 40 different papers. I have reviewed for general science journals (Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), environment and climate journals (Nature Climate Change, Environmental Research Letters, Climatic Change, Geophysical Research Letters), and economic journals (Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, American Journal of Agriculture and Resource Economics). In 2018 I was awarded an Editor’s Citation for Excellence in Refereeing from Geophysical Research Letters. I have served as an ad-hoc reviewer for NSF once and once as a panel reviewer for a graduate fellowship program. 
> I contribute to organizing conferences within both environmental economics and climate science. In 2017 Charles Kolstad and I organized a 2 day meeting that focused on econometric approaches to estimating climate change impacts. It featured 15 paper presenters and 35 attendees in total and ideas from the workshop were developed into a review article (2). I have twice served as an abstract reviewer for the summer meeting of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists and in 2020 jointly organized a session on agricultural impacts and adaptation at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting. I have also contributed guest lectures outside of UC Davis, including at Harvard University (twice), Stanford University (eight times), and University of Colorado (once). 
> To the Public: Parts of my research agenda have implications for policy, particularly the cost-benefit analysis of climate policy, and I participate in processes to better inform these decisions. In 2016, Delavane Diaz and I authored a review of the climate change damages literature as background for a National Academies report on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). I have consulted several times with a team from Resources for the Future (RFF)  working on improving the SCC on how to improve representation of climate change impacts, once with a team from the National Center for Environmental Economics at EPA working on the Biden Administration’s revision of the federal SCC value, and with the General Audit Office. My work to improve the science supporting damage functions for the agricultural sector (5) has been influential in these processes: this work is being incorporated into the RFF modeling and was referenced in the Biden Administration’s interim update to the SCC. I am currently part of a cross-campus working group developing recommendations for use of an internal carbon price for infrastructure decisions within the University of California system.
> I have been active in public communication. I have given 8 public talks since 2016 and have authored two op-eds and one blog post. I regularly talk to journalists about my research and climate policy and economics issues more generally. My research has been covered by international (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), national (New York Times, The Atlantic, The Weather Channel), and regional (Miami Herald) outlets and I have provided commentary on climate issues to radio (American Public Media, National Public Radio), print (New York Times, LA Times), and online (Vox) journalists.

> Throughout my career, I have regularly coordinated workshops, conference sessions, and speaker series.
> I co-organized my department's speaker series at both LSE and UD and the public event series at LSE. In one year each, I led the organization of a global PhD workshop (the Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop in Sustainable Development) and small conference (the Sustainable Development Research Conference), and I helped create the Alliance Science and Policy Summer School. I have chaired multiple conference sessions in climate change, hydrology, and just transitions.

> Nicholas Stern. It then formed the basis for a 50-person, facilitated international expert workshop funded by the UK Department
> for Business, Energy \& Industrial Strategy, which I spearheaded\footnote{July 2020, ``Strengthening Understanding of the Economic Impacts of Climate Change''}. The event won the new Action 2030 Award from Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) and resulted in a review paper \cite{rising2022challenges}.  I recently continued this work by helping organize a meeting convened by the Royal Society in London\footnote{March 2023, ``New horizons for understanding of the economic consequences of climate change'',} and speaking on a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences\footnote{June 2023, ``Workshop on Macroeconomics and Climate-related Risks and Opportunities''}.
> 
> These workshops have also led to my engagement in other international  policy discussions.
> I have participated in the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) as a U.S. nominated expert. A collaboration initiated at the IPBES workshop on modelling Nature Futures scenarios resulted in a recent paper\cite{kramer2023new}. I am part of a new Climate Change Committee Advisory Group on the economics of climate adaptation and resilience.
> 
> I have also played an active role in the organization of my institutions. I headed an initiative to make the GRI carbon neutral, working with LSE's sustainability office and coordinating across multiple working groups on air travel, offsetting,
> behavior change, and other aspects of the transition process. I also helped organize an international research network around just transitions.
> At UD, I helped develop new Masters programs in Environmental Economics (within my department) and Environmental Science \& Management (across my college), and a new PhD program in Environmental Economics.
> 
> I am an active reviewer, reviewing 48 manuscripts, including articles at {\it Nature}, {\it Nature Climate Change}, {\it Science}, {\it Environmental Resource Letters}, the {\it Journal of Environmental Economics and Management}, and {\it Journal of Econometrics}. I have also been involved in reviews of major reports, IPCC chapter drafts, and grant proposal review processes, including a multi-stage process for EU HORIZON grants.
> 
> My research has been used in several public-facing outlets. As part of the Climate Impact Lab, I have contributed to interactive stories for the New York Times (e.g., \href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/climate/how-much-hotter-is-your-hometown.html}{How Much Hotter Is Your Hometown Than When You Were Born?}) and the UN Development Programme (\href{https://horizons.hdr.undp.org/}{Human Climate Horizons}). Individually, I have supported, through advice and analysis the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), US EPA's Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis (CIRA), and the EPA's work on Social Cost of Carbon.

> My career has been filled with opportunities to coordinate workshops, conference sessions, and speaker series. I have seized these moments, co-organizing speaker series at both the London School of Economics (LSE) and University of Delaware (UD), as well as the public event series at the LSE. Additionally, I led the organization of the Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop in Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Research Conference in a single year, and played a substantial role in the creation of the Alliance Science and Policy Summer School. My chairing duties have extended to multiple conference sessions on a range of issues such as climate change, hydrology, and just transitions.
> 
> In 2017, I initiated collaboration with Sir Nicholas Stern and the policy team at the Grantham Research Institute (GRI) to bridge the understanding gap between economists, climate scientists, and policymakers about the risks of climate change. To further this goal, I organized a multidisciplinary workshop for UK researchers and helped coordinate parallel sessions at Columbia and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). This endeavor resulted in a policy report and a New York Times article penned by Naomi Oreskes and Nicholas Stern. Our collaborative efforts were recognized with the Action 2030 Award by the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) and lead to a follow-up workshop, funded by the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.
> 
> I have continued contributing to these efforts, recently convening a meeting with the Royal Society in London and serving on a National Academy of Sciences panel discussing macroeconomics and climate-related risks. Moreover, these workshops paved the way for my involvement in international policy discourse through the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), where I participated as a U.S. nominated expert.
> 
> My institutional service extends to the environmental stewardship of my institutions. At the GRI, I spearheaded an initiative striving for carbon neutrality, involving multi-team coordination. At the UD, I helped develop new Masters programs in Environmental Economics and Environmental Science & Management, along with a new PhD program in Environmental Economics.
> 
> I have reviewed forty-eight manuscripts for several prestigious journals, including 'Nature,' 'Nature Climate Change,' 'Science,' 'Environmental Research Letters', the 'Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,' and the 'Journal of Econometrics.' Additionally, I have participated in reviews of significant reports, IPCC chapter drafts, and various grant proposal processes, incubluding a multi-stage process for the EU HORIZON grants.
> 
> Along with rigorous academic pursuits, I recognize the importance of public engagement in sustainability matters. As part of the Climate Impact Lab, I have aided in producing interactive stories for the New York Times and the UN Development Programme. Independently, I have used my expertise to support the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment, US EPA's Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis, and EPA's work on the Social Cost of Carbon.
