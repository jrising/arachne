> Dear Sir,  
> 
> I am writing to express my keen interest in joining the Marine Studies – Oceanography program at the University of Delaware’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment. As an African graduate with a second-class upper background in Fisheries and Aquaculture, I am deeply committed to advancing sustainable fisheries management and marine conservation, particularly in the context of inland and coastal ecosystems.  
> 
> My academic journey and research experience have provided me with a strong foundation in fisheries science and a passion for addressing critical environmental challenges. My final-year project, "Fishing Gear Types and Characteristics in Inland Fisheries in Ekiti State, Nigeria," allowed me to explore the ecological impacts of fishing practices and propose regulatory frameworks to mitigate overfishing. This work has inspired me to pursue advanced research on ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), with a focus on integrating scientific, technological, and policy-driven approaches to enhance sustainability.  
> 
> The University of Delaware’s renowned expertise in marine conservation, fisheries science, and oceanographic modelling aligns perfectly with my research goals. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to collaborate with distinguished faculty and utilize state-of-the-art facilities such as the Delaware Sea Grant Program and the Centre for Remote Sensing. These resources will be invaluable as I investigate the ecological impacts of fishing gear, evaluate the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) and seasonal closures, and develop dynamic models for sustainable fisheries management.  
> 
> I kindly request that you download the attached document, which provides a detailed outline of my research interests and proposed study, "Integrating Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management and Gear Selectivity to Enhance Sustainable Fisheries in Inland and Coastal Waters." This research aims to contribute innovative solutions to global challenges such as overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate variability. By integrating ecological, oceanographic, and socio-economic data, I hope to provide science-based recommendations for fisheries policies and empower local communities to adopt sustainable practices.  
> 
> I am confident that the University of Delaware’s interdisciplinary approach and collaborative environment will provide the ideal platform for me to achieve my academic and professional aspirations. I am eager to contribute to the university’s groundbreaking research in marine science while advancing my expertise in fisheries management and oceanographic modelling.  
> 
> Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, research interests, and goals align with the mission of the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment.

**assistant**:
> Thank you for providing the email. Based on Adedapo Adeleye's message, here are the specific questions and core points of confusion:
> 
> 1. **Program Selection:** Adedapo mentions a keen interest in joining the Marine Studies – Oceanography program. However, it might be more suitable to direct them towards alternative programs due to the transition of some programs or their specific research focus.
> 
> 2. **Research Interests and Alignment:** Adedapo is interested in advancing research on ecosystem-based fisheries management and integrating scientific, technological, and policy-driven approaches.
> 
> 3. **Details on the Marine Studies Program:** Adedapo is under the impression that there might be a particular focus on marine conservation, fisheries science, and oceanographic modeling, which aligns with his research goals.
> 
> I didn't spot any local connection to Delaware or the mentioned schools.

> 
> Dear Adedapo,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in marine sciences at the University of Delaware. Your background in Fisheries and Aquaculture, along with your focus on sustainable fisheries management, is highly relevant to our areas of study.
> 
> We have several programs that might align with your interests, especially considering the transition of the Marine Policy program to the new Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program, which offers a Marine track that could be a great fit for your goals.
> 
> Recognizing your interest in integrating ecological data and policy, the Environmental Science & Management Master's or Ph.D. in Environmental Economics might also suit your aspirations, particularly if you are looking to incorporate quantitative modeling.
> 
> To better guide you to the most suitable program, I encourage you to fill out the following form, which will help us assist you in finding the right fit and understanding key issues regarding the application and program specifics:
> 
> [Program Identification Form](https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7)
> 
> Please note, while limited funding is available for Ph.D. programs, the Masters programs are typically self-funded.
> 
> Should you have strong quantitative skills aligned with my research interests—such as climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling—I encourage you to mention my name in your statement of purpose. Be aware that the application deadline for full PhD consideration is December 1.
> 
> Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
