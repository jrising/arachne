> I have used the line `xr.open_rasterio` to open a BIL file in xarray, and all this requires is that I have the `rasterio` package installed. But elsewhere, I see statements that one needs to use `rioxarray.open_rasterio` using the `rioxarray` package. Is this necessary?
**assistant**:
> Both `xr.open_rasterio` from `xarray` and `rioxarray.open_rasterio` from `rioxarray` packages can open BIL files, as you have seen. The choice to use one over the other really depends on your specific needs in processing geospatial rasters.

> The key difference is that `rioxarray` is a specialized package built specifically to extend `xarray`'s functionality with raster data. Here are some things `rioxarray` can do that `xarray` can't, which might influence your decision:
> 
> 1. **Writing raster files**: `rioxarray` lets you write (and read) raster data including from/to geotiff, one of the most common formats for raster data. `xarray` does not support this out of the box.
> 
> 2. **Handling raster metadata**: `rioxarray` is designed to handle and preserve raster metadata better than `xarray` alone. For example, you can read and preserve the spatial reference (i.e. the raster's projection/coordinate reference system) and also other metadata that would otherwise be discarded with `xr.open_rasterio`.
> 
> 3. **Raster operations**: `rioxarray` provides more features and functions for handling raster datasets, such as clipping, reprojecting, and resampling.
> 
> In summary, if you are performing less complex operations, and you don't need to handle projections or metadata, you can stick with `xr.open_rasterio` from `xarray`. If you will be performing more complex geospatial operations, particularly those involving raster datasets, `rioxarray.open_rasterio` from `rioxarray` would be the better option.
