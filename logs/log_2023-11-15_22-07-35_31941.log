**user**:
> What would you call "climate" data that is for features of the ocean, such as SST?
**assistant**:
> Oceanic climate data, also sometimes referred to as marine climate data, is an appropriate term for "climate" data that pertains to features of the ocean such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST). This data could include a variety of parameters related to both the physical and biological conditions of the ocean, including temperature, salinity, pH, nutrient concentration, primary productivity, and others.
