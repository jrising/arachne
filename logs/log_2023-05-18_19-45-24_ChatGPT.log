**assistant**:
> Ice cream trucks typically play different tunes depending on the region and specific company. However, one of the most commonly heard tunes coming from an ice cream truck in the United States is "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin. It's a classic ragtime tune that has become almost synonymous with ice cream trucks.

> Another common tune is "Turkey in the Straw," an old folk song that has been used for well over a century. "Pop Goes the Weasel," "Camptown Races," and "Home, Sweet Home" are also commonly used.

> It's worth noting that some ice cream trucks today play more modern or varied tunes, and the specific tune can depend on the company, the region, and the specific truck.
