> I am overlaying multiple polygons on a plot_ly graph in Shiny. I want one of those to have a solid color and the rest to be just outlines. Here's what I currently do:
> ```
> plot_ly(height=500) %>%
>     add_polygons(x=xx2, y=yy2, split=group2, line=list(width=1, color='toself'))
>     add_polygons(x=xx, y=yy, split="Current", fillcolor="blue", line=list(width=1, color='blue')) %>%
>             layout(title="Distribution of Social Cost of Carbon",
>                    xaxis=list(title="SCC ($/t)"),
>                    yaxis=list(title="Probability Density"))
> ```

> Where xx2, yy2, and group2 are the ones that should just be outlines and xx, yy should be the solid one. It almost works: the outlined ones are in half-transparency fills, and the legend on the main one is confusingly "Current blue" when it should just be "Current". How can I fix this?

> Great question, James! To achieve a solid fill for one polygon while maintaining only outlines for the others, you need to make a few adjustments. Specifically, you need to set the `fillcolor` parameter to 'rgba(0,0,0,0)' for the polygons you want outlined, and ensure the `showlegend` parameter is set correctly to display the legend as you intend. Hereâ€™s the updated code:
> 
> ```r
> plot_ly(height=500) %>% 
>     add_polygons(x=xx2, y=yy2, split=group2, line=list(width=1, color='blue'), fillcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)', showlegend=FALSE) %>%
>     add_polygons(x=xx, y=yy, fillcolor="blue", line=list(width=1, color='blue'), name='Current') %>%
>     layout(title="Distribution of Social Cost of Carbon",
>            xaxis=list(title="SCC ($/t)"),
>            yaxis=list(title="Probability Density"))
> ```
> 
> Here's a breakdown of the changes:
> 1. **Adding `fillcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)'`** to the `add_polygons` for `xx2`, `yy2`, and `group2` ensures these polygons are only outlined without any fill color.
> 2. **Setting `showlegend=FALSE`** for the same `add_polygons` ensures that these outlined polygons do not appear in the legend.
> 3. **Explicitly setting `name='Current'`** in the `add_polygons` for the solid polygon (with `xx`, `yy`) updates its legend correctly.
> 
> This should ensure that you get a solid fill for the "Current" polygon and outlined polygons without fills, along with the correct legend display. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
