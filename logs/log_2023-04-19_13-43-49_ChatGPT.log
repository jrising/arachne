**assistant**:
> Yes, I can suggest a few papers that discuss the problem of self-reinforcing mental models in science. These papers explore how certain ideas and assumptions can become entrenched in scientific thinking, potentially hindering the development of new theories or approaches. Some of the papers listed below are directly related to the topic, while others provide valuable context or address similar issues in scientific research.
> 
> 1. Kuhn, T. S. (1962). The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. University of Chicago Press.
>    This groundbreaking book examines the nature of scientific progress and the role of "paradigms" in shaping scientific thought. It argues that the scientific community can become locked into a particular way of thinking, only to undergo a radical shift during a scientific revolution.
> 
> 2. Feyerabend, P. (1975). Against Method. Verso Books.
>    This controversial book challenges the idea that there is a single, fixed method for conducting scientific research. Feyerabend argues that scientists should be free to use any approach that seems promising, even if it contradicts established theories or methods.
> 
> 3. Lakatos, I. (1970). Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes. In Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, Lakatos, I., & Musgrave, A. (eds.). Cambridge University Press.
>    This influential paper introduces the idea of "scientific research programmes," which consist of a hard core of theoretical assumptions and a protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses. Lakatos argues that the persistence of a research programme depends on its ability to generate new empirical predictions, rather than its ability to withstand falsification.
> 
> 4. Latour, B., & Woolgar, S. (1979). Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts. Princeton University Press.
>    This ethnographic study of a scientific laboratory explores how scientific facts are constructed through social processes and negotiations among scientists. The authors argue that scientific knowledge is shaped by self-reinforcing mental models, as well as the social dynamics within research communities.
> 
> 5. Oreskes, N., & Conway, E. M. (2010). Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming. Bloomsbury Press.
>    This book examines how a small group of scientists with strong ideological commitments have been able to influence public opinion and policy on a range of scientific issues. It offers valuable insights into how self-reinforcing mental models can shape both scientific research and public understanding.
> 
> 6. Ioannidis, J. P. A. (2005). Why Most Published Research Findings Are False. PLoS Medicine, 2(8), e124.
>    This influential paper discusses how various biases and methodological flaws can lead to the publication of false or misleading research findings. It highlights the importance of questioning established mental models and remaining open to alternative explanations.
> 
> 7. Nosek, B. A., et al. (2015). Promoting an Open Research Culture. Science, 348(6242), 1422-1425.
>    This paper discusses the importance of transparency, reproducibility, and openness in scientific research. The authors argue that adopting these practices can help to counteract the self-reinforcing nature of mental models and facilitate the growth of knowledge.
**user**:
> Do you have suggestions of academic papers that discuss ethics in day-to-day research (as distinct from IRB approval)?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! There are numerous academic papers that discuss ethics in day-to-day research beyond the scope of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. These papers often address issues such as data management, authorship, peer review, conflicts of interest, and research integrity. Here are a few notable papers that you might find useful:
> 
> 1. Shamoo, A. E., & Resnik, D. B. (2009). Responsible Conduct of Research (2nd ed.). Oxford University Press.
>    This comprehensive book covers a wide range of ethical issues in day-to-day research, providing guidance for researchers, students, and administrators.
> 
> 2. Macrina, F. L. (2014). Scientific Integrity: Text and Cases in Responsible Conduct of Research (4th ed.). ASM Press.
>    This book covers various aspects of research ethics, with a focus on case studies that illustrate real-world dilemmas researchers may face in their day-to-day work.
> 
> 3. Fanelli, D. (2009). How Many Scientists Fabricate and Falsify Research? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Survey Data. PLoS ONE, 4(5), e5738.
>    This paper reviews survey data to estimate the prevalence of fabrication, falsification, and other forms of misconduct in scientific research, offering insights into the importance of ethical conduct in everyday research.
> 
> 4. Resnik, D. B., & Master, Z. (2013). Policies to Promote Research Integrity: A Systematic Review. Accountability in Research, 20(3), 175-196.
>    This paper systematically reviews policies designed to promote research integrity and discusses their effectiveness in maintaining ethical conduct in day-to-day research.

>    This paper discusses the role of peer review in promoting ethical conduct in research and explores potential innovations that could improve the process, such as open peer review and post-publication review.
> 
> These papers should provide a solid starting point for understanding the various ethical issues that can arise in day-to-day research and the importance of addressing them.
