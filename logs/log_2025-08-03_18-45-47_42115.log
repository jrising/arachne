> Do you have a recommendation for a good version of the stories of Thor as a movie for kids?
**assistant**:
> For a kid-friendly introduction to the stories of Thor, I recommend the movie "Thor: Tales of Asgard" (2011). Itâ€™s an animated film produced by Marvel Animation that focuses on a young Thor and his journey into adulthood. The film dives into Norse mythology in a way that's accessible to children, offering adventure and valuable lessons.
> 
> If your boys are a bit older, "Thor" (2011), the live-action Marvel Studios film, could work as well. It's action-packed and has some comedic elements, yet it remains largely family-friendly. However, the animated version is likely more tailored to younger audiences.
> 
> Both options provide a fun gateway into the wider universe of Norse mythology and Marvel's interpretation of Thor.
