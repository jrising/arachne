> My name is Nasrin Badrzadeh, I am a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering from Tarbiat Modares University. (one of the best Iranian universities). The project of my thesis was “Modeling and Assessment of Management Practices on Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Discharges into River Systems”. I am sending this email to inquire if you have any available funded Ph.D. positions.
> 
> I believe that my greatest contribution to water systems management will be achieved by obtaining a Ph.D. While recognizing that I am at an early stage of my education, I have already achieved the following accomplishments:
> 
> ·         Published a paper in Science of The Total Environment.
> 
> ·         Worked in Various Fields of Water Science Engineering as a junior water resource management expert at a consulting firm.
> 
> ·         Ranked  1st in the B.Sc. and 15th in the M.Sc. nationwide university entrance exam.
> 
> Furthermore, another research paper related to Optimizing Environmental Flow Regime and Water Quality in Rivers has been published to Environmental Monitoring and Assessment and water supply journal.
> 
> I was seeking a professor whose area of interest matches those of mine and, therefore, I found your recent research focus and projects appealing and of high suitability which enticed me to email you. I am confident that if you give me the opportunity, I will be a helpful addition to your lab. Attached is my CV which may help you find more about me. Please let me know if you need more information.

**assistant**:
> Dear Nasrin,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your strong background in water systems management and successful publication record clearly demonstrate your potential in this field.

> Upon reviewing your previous work and achievements, it sounds like you might be interested in the Ph.D. in Marine Policy. This program is geared towards non-traditional students or those with lighter quantitative backgrounds. It would offer you extensive opportunities to apply interdisciplinary approaches to explore complex marine issues. Limited funding is indeed available, and your research focus on water systems could align well with the department’s interests, which include climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
> 
> To increase your chances for available funds, I suggest you mention my name in your statement of purpose when you apply, emphasizing our shared interest in the management of water systems.
> 
> Please submit your application by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funds. If your interest aligns more with natural science, you may want to reach out to Xinfeng Liang (xfliang@udel.edu) who oversees our natural science programs.
> 
> I look forward to your application.
