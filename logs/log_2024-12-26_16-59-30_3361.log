> Is there a one-to-one relationship between life expectancy and mortality rates? If average mortality rate is 1 / 100, doesn't that mean that people live 100 years on average?
**assistant**:
> The relationship between life expectancy and mortality rates is not as straightforward as a simple inverse. While it's tempting to think that if the average mortality rate is \(1/100\), that would imply an average life expectancy of 100 years, this isn't really how it works.
> 
> Life expectancy is calculated from life tables which account for varying mortality rates at different ages. If the mortality rate were constant at \(1/100\) across all ages, then hypothetically, one might reason toward a life expectancy of 100 years. However, in real-world populations, mortality rates vary significantly over a person's lifetime—typically very low in childhood, increasing with age, and peaking in old age.
> 
> Moreover, high infant and child mortality can reduce the average life expectancy, even if those who survive childhood have a relatively low mortality rate as adults. As people age, other factors such as health conditions, effectiveness of healthcare, and lifestyle choices also affect mortality rates and life expectancy.
> 
> In sum, while mortality rates are a critical factor in determining life expectancy, the two are not linked by a simple inverse relationship; instead, they reflect a complex interplay of age-specific data and factors.
**user**:
> Sure, but if total mortality rate (total deaths divided by total population) goes up, life expectancy must go down, right?
**assistant**:
> Yes, that's correct! If the total mortality rate increases (which means more deaths occur relative to the population), it generally leads to a decrease in life expectancy. Here's why:
> 
> 1. **Overall Impact**: An increase in the total mortality rate indicates that a greater proportion of individuals are dying, whether due to increased deaths at younger ages, a spike in mortality from certain causes, or both. This reduction in survival rates directly lowers average life expectancy.
> 
> 2. **Life Table Dynamics**: Life expectancy calculations are derived from life tables that factor in mortality rates across various age groups. If mortality increases at any age—especially at younger ages or prime working years—it will shift the average downward.
> 
> 3. **Population Structure**: In populations where mortality rates rise, the demographic structure can also change (e.g., fewer young people surviving), which further affects life expectancy figures.
> 
> So, while life expectancy often responds to changes in total mortality rates, keep in mind that specific age distributions, causes of death, and health trends also play critical roles.
