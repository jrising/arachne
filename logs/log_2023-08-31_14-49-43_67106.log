> Commercial fishing activity in Delaware marine waters relies on technology such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS), Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and Vessel Trip Reports (VTR) to measure catch and fishing activity. However, VTR data has its limitations, due to confidentiality restrictions and inaccuracies in representing fishing locations. Observed between 2011 and 2020, the total average landing was about 4.9 million lbs., with a minimum of 3.5 million lbs., and a maximum of 6 million lbs. This resulted in an average total revenue of $9.1 million, fluctuating between $6.8 and $11.8 million. Finfish accounted for an average of 398,000 lbs. ($676,000 of revenue), while shellfish and other categories accounted for a much larger average of 4.5 million lbs. ($8.4 million of revenue). Key species included in this activity are the blue crab, with an average landing of 3.5 million lbs. ($6.5 million in revenue), and the eastern oyster, black sea bass, and knobbed whelk amongst others. Vessel activity also features regular traffic from fishing boats, with around 18% of the pass-thru length (about 23 meters) being occupied by fishing vessels, resulting in an estimated count of 1,960 fishing boats.
