> What is considered a "rainy day", when doing analysis of precipitation data. Is it any day with >0 precip, or is there a lower threshold?
**assistant**:
> A "rainy day" in the context of precipitation analysis can vary depending on the threshold set by researchers or meteorologists. However, there are a few commonly used standards.
> 
> 1. **WMO Standard**: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines a "rainy day" as a day during which at least 0.1mm (or 1mm, depending on the source) of precipitation falls.
> 
> 2. **TRMM Standard**: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission defines a "rainy day" as a day with at least 1mm of rainfall.
> 
> 3. **Local or Regional Standards**: These are often defined based on the local climate and can vary widely. For example, in a desert region, a "rainy day" threshold could be much lower than in a tropical region.
> 
> Regardless of the chosen threshold, it's important to communicate that standard when reporting the analysis, to ensure clear understanding and to maintain transparency in the methodology.
> 
> In your own analysis, you could set the threshold based on the goal of your research. If you're studying heavy rainfall events, for instance, you might set a higher threshold. But if you're interested in any amount of precipitation, even light drizzle or trace amounts, you could choose a lower threshold.
