> Does the EU ETS cover emissions from cement and flaring?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) does cover emissions from the cement industry, as it is considered one of the energy-intensive industrial sectors. Emissions from the sector are controlled through a cap and trade system where companies must hold allowances equivalent to their emissions. There is an ongoing debate about how well this covers the indirect emissions of cement, through its use, but its direct emissions are included.
> 
> However, flaring comes under somewhat more varied jurisdiction. While the EU ETS does cover emissions from most off-gas flaring (e.g., during oil refining), some flaring is not covered if it falls outside specific sectors included in the EU ETS. Generally, if the flaring occurs as part of a process within a sector covered by the EU ETS, then it is included. If not (often in the case of emergency flaring or in exploration/extraction), it may be overlooked.

> As always in these matters, specifics can vary, so it's crucial to check the details of databases or legislative documents in question.
