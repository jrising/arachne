**user**:
> In Julia, how can I collapse a DataFrame to the mean of all values grouped by a given column?
**assistant**:
> You can accomplish this using the `DataFrames` package in Julia by using functions `groupby` and `combine`.
> 
> Here is a general example:
> 
> ```julia
> using DataFrames
> 
> # Assume df is your DataFrame and `:group_column` is the column you want to group by
> df = DataFrame(group_column = ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'], 
>                value1 = [1,2,3,4,5], 
>                value2 = [5,4,3,2,1])
> 
> grouped_df = groupby(df, :group_column)
> 
> # This will take the mean of all other columns, grouped by `:group_column`
> mean_df = combine(grouped_df, [:value1, :value2] .=> mean)
> 
> println(mean_df)
> ```
>  
> This code will return a new DataFrame with the group column and the mean of all other columns. It is recommended to replace `value1` and `value2` with the names of your columns.
> 
> Note: The dot before the `=>` operator is used for "broadcasting" the function `mean` to each column named in the array, performing elementwise operations.
**user**:
> How do I get the list of all column names excluding group_column?
**assistant**:
> To obtain a list of all column names excluding the `group_column` in Julia, you can use the `names` function in combination with the `Not` function from the `DataStructures` package.
> 
> Here's an example:
> 
> ```julia
> using DataFrames, DataStructures
> 
> # Assume df is your DataFrame
> df = DataFrame(group_column = ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'], 
>                value1 = [1,2,3,4,5], 
>                value2 = [5,4,3,2,1])
> 
> column_names = names(df)[names(df) .!= :group_column]
> 
> println(column_names)
> ```
> 
> This code will output an array of column names excluding the `group_column`. In this example, the `names(df)` function returns an array of all column names in the DataFrame, and then we use the `Not` function to exclude the `group_column` from the array.
