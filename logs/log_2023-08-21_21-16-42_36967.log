> In QGIS's layout designer, can I make a legend describing the size of a marker (since my markers are sized according to a variable)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you certainly can create a size-based legend in QGIS's layout designer, but it's not as straightforward as creating a color-based one. You have to manually create a representative legend for size variables. Here's how you can do that:
> 
> 1. Start by creating a normal legend through the "*Add Legend*" button under the "*Items*" tab.
> 
> 2. If your layer isn't already in your legend, add it.
> 
> 3. Then, since QGIS canâ€™t automatically generate size legends, you'll create it manually. You can add "*Add Rectangle*" or "*Add Ellipse*" items for the marker shapes. Adjust their sizes to match the range of data your point markers represent.
> 
> 4. You must manually add the corresponding text through "*Add Label*" to those shapes, describing what each size represents.
> 
> 5. Move all these items around in your layout to achieve your desired result.
> 
> Bear in mind that this method requires manual updating if your data changes.
> 
> I hope this helps, James! Is there anything else about QGIS that you need assistance with?
