> There’s a risk that the clean energy transition will be like the food in a bad restaurant: the taste is horrible, and the portions are too small. The green transition will be disruptive, with whole sectors disrupted, jobs lost, and regions losing their economic engines. There will be losers and winners. And the groups that stand to lose out can become real barriers to the changes we need to make. Making sure that the green transition is socially just may also be necessary to it happening at all.

> The clean energy transition lies at the intersection of three global challenges or constraints:

> -	A technology challenge, as we scale up new innovations in the energy system.
> -	And an education challenge, training and retraining people to get jobs as part of the green transition, rather than losing out from all these changes.
> We need integrated plans that satisfy all of these in a socially just way, and that is only possible if we bring together researchers across a wide range of fields: climate change, economics, engineering, and public policy.

> We propose forming a Laboratory for the Just Green Transition. This would be a cross-departmental research lab, collaborating on concrete projects and producing integrated plans. Our first projects would focus on identifying the fossil fuel jobs lost and the new skills that are needed, and then translating this into the information that UD needs today to position its program offerings. The goal of the lab is to position UD as a leader in planning for this future.

> Here's a revised version of your pitch that aims to make it clearer, more engaging, and impactful:
> 
> "Picture a meal at a dismal restaurant – unpalatable and served in paltry portions. That's the risk we face with the transition to clean energy. Disruption on a massive scale - entire sectors shaken, jobs vanished, and regions losing their economic pillars. There will be winners, yes, but also losers. The groups standing to lose could form insurmountable barriers to the very change we need. Ensuring a socially just green transition is not just ethical, but perhaps a prerequisite for it to happen at all.

> The clean energy revolution sits squarely at the crossroads of three formidable global challenges: 
> - The climate challenge - keeping global warming under 2°C.
> - The technology challenge - amplifying the scale of novel energy innovations.
> - The education challenge - training and retraining individuals for new roles in the green transition, rather than leaving them in the dust. 
> Addressing these challenges in a socially just manner requires an interdisciplinary approach that pulls expertise from climate change, economics, engineering, and public policy.
> 
> That's why we propose the establishment of a Laboratory for the Just Green Transition. This would be a collaborative research hub across departments, working on tangible projects and generating comprehensive plans. Our inaugural projects will center on recognizing the jobs lost in the fossil fuel sector and understanding the new skills needed. We aim to transform this knowledge into actionable information to aid UD in tailoring its program offerings. Our objective? To position UD as a trailblazer in planning for a sustainable future. Join us in this bold step forward."
