> The clean energy transition will be disruptive, with individual workers, regional communities, and whole sectors forced to redefine themselves. Industries and individuals who do not see themselves as part of the low-carbon future can become barriers to enacting change. More broadly, a plan is needed that satisfies the exigencies of staying under 2° C warming and developing economies of scale for green technology, against the political and social justice necessity of ensuring that every member of society sees a low-carbon future for themselves. Such a planning process requires input from multiple scientific disciplines, engineers and innovators, and stakeholders at multiple levels. An unappreciated centerpiece of such a plan is education and training, as universities prepare the next generation to participate in the transition. The elaboration of this plan supports every pillar of UD’s strategy: Student Success Pillar: UD can prepare for a new, diverse body of non-traditional students in need of new education and skills. Social Justice Pillar: UD would contribute both to internal diversity and social justice for society at large. Interdisciplinary and Global Pillar: This project positions UD to address the multifaceted global challenge of a clean energy transition. Innovation and Entrepreneurship Pillar: It provides new opportunities for close collaboration with businesses and new entrepreneurship in support of a sustainable economy for Delaware and the US. Intellectual and Physical Capital Pillar: It identifies strategic needs for professional and continuing studies in a world with remote workforces, remote learning, and transformational change.

> The transition to clean energy will inevitably cause significant disruptions, compelling individuals, communities, and entire sectors to reinvent themselves. Industries and individuals who fail to align with the low-carbon future may inadvertently hinder progressive change. Therefore, a comprehensive plan that balances the necessity of limiting global warming to below 2° C and fostering green technology economies of scale with the political and social imperative to ensure everyone can envision a low-carbon future is crucial. This plan necessitates input from diverse scientific fields, engineers, innovators, and multi-level stakeholders. A frequently overlooked cornerstone of such a plan is education and training, with universities being tasked with preparing the forthcoming generation to facilitate this transition.

**user**:
> I would like to find another way to say "the political and social imperative to ensure everyone can envision a low-carbon future is crucial". My point here is that there are winners and losers in the transition, and that it is a matter of social justice as well as political necessity that the policy does not appear to throw people under the bus.
**assistant**:
> The necessity of orchestrating a policy that balances social justice concerns and political considerations, ensuring that all individuals feel included and valued in the transition to a low-carbon future, is paramount. This approach acknowledges that the transition will create both winners and losers, and it's vital that the policy doesn't seem to sacrifice certain groups for the greater good.

**assistant**:
> Industries and individuals who either cannot envision their role in a low-carbon future or feel disadvantaged by climate policies could potentially become obstacles to implementing transformative change.
**user**:
> Can you improve this setence: "Therefore, a comprehensive plan that balances the necessity of limiting warming to below 2° C and fostering green technology economies of scale with the political and social imperative of minimizing vulnerable groups is crucial."
**assistant**:
> Therefore, it is crucial to devise a comprehensive plan that harmonizes the critical objectives of confining global warming to below 2° C and promoting economies of scale in green technologies, with the political and social obligation to protect vulnerable groups from undue impact.

> 
> We will form a university-wide research laboratory, drawing together expertise in climate science, civil and energy engineering, environmental and labor economics, and climate policy and governance. The Lab complements existing institutions (the Climate Hub, CEEP, DEI, DENIN) through its emphasis on focused collaborations, integrative planning, and social justice. Initial Unidel support will be used to develop an assessment of sectoral shifts in the US consistent with a sustainable transition, and the associated direct and indirect job displacements and skill needs. In many cases, the societal disruptions and needs are not obvious since they emerge along supply chains and from regional transitions. As a result, many more groups are at risk of losing their livelihoods and needing policy and educational support. The work will bring together existing energy investment models and economic models with state-of-the-art research approaches for studying skills mappings. This will be shortly followed by a strategy for UD to keep ahead of oncoming trends, identifying the education programs needed for students today to support the transition tomorrow. Subsequent work, drawing upon partnerships with Resources for the Future and the Research Network for Energy Workforce Transitions, will close the current gap between energy planning and on-the-ground policy-making. To do this, we will develop a new data and models of past policies, current innovations, and future economic changes. The long history of failures in economic transition planning points to our need for better knowledge about the policies and mechanisms necessary to enact a comprehensive transition justly and efficiently, but properly used can provide the basis for better policy and industrial development. This research will position the Lab as a renouned source for policy-directed research and provide a strong foundation for pursuing future funding. At the same time, an integrated plan for a just transition, addressing environment, energy, and education, will simultaneously engender broader political support for rapid action, empower better decisions in UD’s educational offerings, and allow other groups to plan their own transitions.

> We propose to establish a comprehensive university-wide research laboratory, pooling expertise in climate science, civil and energy engineering, environmental and labor economics, and climate policy and governance. This laboratory stands out from existing institutions such as the Climate Hub, CEEP, DEI, and DENIN through its focus on dedicated collaborations, integrative planning, and social justice. Initial Unidel funding will be used to evaluate sectoral shifts in the US, in line with a sustainable transition, examining associated direct and indirect job displacements and skill requirements. Often, societal disruptions and needs aren't immediately evident as they arise within supply chains and from regional transitions, putting numerous groups at risk of job loss and in need of policy and educational support. 
> 
> Our approach involves combining existing energy investment and economic models with cutting-edge research methods for studying skills mappings. This will be promptly followed by a strategy for UD to stay abreast of forthcoming trends, pinpointing the educational programs necessary to equip today's students to facilitate tomorrow's transition. Later work, leveraging partnerships with Resources for the Future and the Research Network for Energy Workforce Transitions, will bridge the existing gap between energy planning and practical policy-making. To achieve this, we will create new data and models of past policies, current innovations, and future economic changes.

> Past failures in economic transition planning underline the need for enhanced understanding of the policies and mechanisms essential for implementing a comprehensive transition justly and efficiently. When properly utilized, this knowledge can form the basis for improved policy and industrial development. This research will position the Lab as a respected authority for policy-guided research, laying a strong foundation for securing future funding. Concurrently, an integrated plan for a just transition, addressing environment, energy, and education, will foster broader political support for swift action, enhance decision-making in UD’s educational offerings, and enable other groups to plan their transitions effectively.
