**user**:
> In python, how can I remove any #... stuff from the end of a url?
**assistant**:
> In Python, you can remove the fragment (the part of a URL that follows a `'#'` character) by using the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from the `urllib.parse` module. Here is an example code snippet:
> 
> ```python
> from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
> 
> def remove_fragment(url):
>     parsed_url = urlparse(url)
>     cleaned_url = parsed_url._replace(fragment="")
>     return urlunparse(cleaned_url)
> 
> url = "http://example.com/path#fragment"
> cleaned_url = remove_fragment(url)
> 
> print(cleaned_url)  # Prints: http://example.com/path
> ```
> 
> This code works by parsing the URL into its components, replacing the fragment with an empty string, and then reconstructing the URL without the fragment.
**user**:
> How about just using string manipulation to drop everything after a # in the url?
**assistant**:
> You can indeed use string manipulation to remove everything after a `'#'` character in a URL. Here's an example using basic string operations:
> 
> ```python
> def remove_fragment(url):
>     if '#' in url:
>         return url.split('#')[0]
>     return url
> 
> url = "http://example.com/path#fragment"
> cleaned_url = remove_fragment(url)
> 
> print(cleaned_url)  # Output: http://example.com/path
> ```
> 
> In this code snippet, the `remove_fragment` function splits the URL at the `'#'` character and returns only the part before the `'#'`. If there is no `'#'` in the URL, it returns the original URL.
