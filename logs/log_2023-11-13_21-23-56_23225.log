**user**:
> What global warming level is expected for a CO2 concentration of 550 ppm?
**assistant**:
> Increasing CO2 concentration to 550 parts per million (ppm) from the pre-industrial level of about 280 ppm is approximately doubling it. According to most climate models, doubling the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would ultimately result in a global warming of about 2.0 - 4.5 degrees Celsius, with a most likely value of about 3.0 degrees Celsius. This warming is often referred to as "climate sensitivity".
> 
> However, please note that this is a simplified estimate. The actual warming from an increase in CO2 may be more or less, due to various feedback mechanisms identified by climate science, including changes in water vapor, ice melting, and vegetation changes. Further, this only considers carbon dioxide and not other greenhouse gases. Additionally, it's important to mention that time is a major factor as there can be a lag between increased emissions and experienced warming. 
> 
> These uncertainties are part of the reason why efforts must continue to aggressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
