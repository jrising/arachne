> ===
> 
> Economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK, and benefits of adaptation action
> 
> Informal scoping document
> December 2024
> 
> 1. Overview and scope
> 
> We are looking to produce UK-level climate damage scenarios with a specific focus on the macro-economic impacts. We want to use these impacts as the basis for developing our understanding of the fiscal impacts, and as part of a longer-term piece around the benefits of adaptation actions.
> 
> We want to try and take a hybrid approach bringing together all the best UK sector modelling and then incorporating the results within a macro-modelling framework like Nigem. To note, this approach mirrors the one in Nicola’s Nature GFI study.
> 
> 2. Context
> 
> Over the past year, we’ve done a bit of work using Nigem/ NGFS and come up against the fact that they are not UK-specific and have limited coverage of risk channels (including nothing on international spillovers). Colleagues on the fiscal side built an internal tool to translate macro impacts into fiscal ones, but the work was paused due to the issues with NGFS at a UK level. 
> 
> The OBR covered climate damages as part of their Fiscal Risks and Sustainability report 2024, but have held off covering adaptation due to current data gaps. They plan to come back to this in the next phase of the work (most likely, post-CCRA4 publication in 2026).
> 
> Finally, we’ve been working with Paul Watkiss as part of his ACCREU (EC Horizon) work on adaptation investment needs, building on the CCC’s adaptation investment report. This has been useful in framing our thinking but has also shone a light on the variable quality of the evidence on the benefits of adaptation action. We would like to improve this as part of an ongoing programme of work, linking it back to the climate damage assessment, which we see as the key first step.
> 
> We’ve pulled together a community of interested parties across HMG and got support from our Executive Management Board here at HMT. The OBR are also really keen to be able to do more having taken stock of just how challenging it is in their recent FRS report.
> 
> There are other programmes of work which we can draw on:
> •	UKRI projects. This includes a climate-related food price shocks project led by Pete Smith and Anna Taylor and an ATTENUATE project which looks at the benefits of adaptation action, taking a case studies approach.
> •	CCRA4 – this includes sectoral deep dives. The intention is to publish a dataset in spreadsheet form which includes benefits of adaptation action.
> •	Project Delta (including BoE and Met Office) which is looking at improving the quality of granular UK data on physical risks.
> 
> 3. Research questions and objectives
> 
> There are three core questions which HMT (and the OBR) would like to be in a position to answer:
> a)	What are UK macroeconomic impacts of climate change, including international spillovers/imported risk (addressing the limitations of NGFS), and accounting for autonomous adaptation and its costs?
> b)	What are the fiscal impacts associated with these damage and adaptation costs (updating the OBR FRS24, which relied on NGFS for inputs)?
> c)	Across a suite of key adaptation options, what are fiscal and socioeconomic costs associated with various levels of risk reduction?
> d)	How can funding best distributed across adaptation options to achieve risk reduction goals?
> 
> We are looking for expertise in particular on a) and c), with an initial focus on a). If needed, we can scope b) out and cover that within HMT/OBR.
> 
> The objectives are then:
> 1.	Shape HMT’s understanding and response to climate risk, including our approach to managing economic and fiscal risk and our international and financial stability work (questions a-c, with a focus on a). 
> 1.1.	Develop outputs on macroeconomic impacts that we can use as part of our core narrative across HMT and for Ministers, as well as the basis for our ongoing work in this space.
> 1.2.	Set out an economic baseline which includes climate damage for use as a reference point for framing our work on economic growth, rather than the de facto ‘no climate’ baseline.
> 2.	Ensure our quantification of the fiscal risks is based on the best evidence that we have no major gaps on transmission channels.
> 3.	Ensure spending decisions on climate adaptation are based on the best possible evidence, and the benefits can be traced back to an assessment of UK climate damages.
> 4.	Support timely decision-making as part of an ongoing programme of work, by designing the approach to include new evidence as and when this is available, including 2026 CCRA4 outputs on adaptation, and developing open-source tools.
> 5.	Support other countries to undertake similar work, by developing open-source tools and sharing insights.
> 
> 4. Outputs
> 
> The critical piece for us is that the modelling tools and assumptions are fully transparent and well documented, including detailed outputs in spreadsheet format (interim sectoral results and macroeconomic outputs) which can be shared. 
> 
> Ideally, we would like to be able to run the macroeconomic model in-house, as would the OBR, and develop tools that can be updated with better evidence as and when (including CCRA4 outputs for example, or anything coming out of OECD and IMF modelling on the international side). Being able to run models in-house also increases the likelihood that these will have a more significant policy impact and become embedded in day-to-day thinking.
> 
> 5. Approach
>  
> We want to bring together some of the best sector modelling expertise across the UK, building on the 2021 Grantham study, including people like Paul Bates from Bristol on floods. On the international side, we would like to try and replicate some of the approach again in the GFI study which covered complex supply chain risks and food price impacts across multiple scenarios (e.g. El Nino, multiple breadbasket failures), bringing together relevant experts in each area and using historical analogues to fill data gaps). Brendan Bailey here at HMT would be a very good person to have involved in this as someone with a lot of expertise and relevant knowledge. 
>  
> In order to be able to aggregate fiscal impacts, we also need to be able to split out public and private sector benefits.
> 
> From our work to date, we are particularly aware of the poor quality of evidence on the benefits of adaptation action – it is therefore really important to be able to build in better information on this as the evidence continues to be developed.
>  
> We’d also like to try and build in a bit of a backcasting exercise to calibrate estimates with historical damage. There’s some existing work going on there at Manchester University and some more in the pipeline. Note that the Met Office are interested in building a database of damage costs in the future which could be used as a data source (replicating something that NOAA have which goes back to the 80s and has great visualisations - Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters | National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) (noaa.gov)).
> 
> Scenarios
> We would like to take a scenarios approach, which reflects different levels of warming. This could build on the OBR’s approach in FRS24 where they had two scenarios – a) under 2 degrees C and b) under 3 degrees C.
> 
> We suggest adding to that: c) under 4 degrees C, plus d) scenario(s) which look at tail risks such as AMOC collapse.
> 
> Outstanding questions
> Important questions to be worked up are:
> •	What are the information requirements from the sectoral models (including format) 
> •	What macro framework do we want to work with
> •	What are the boundaries for the work (i.e. do we scope out the fiscal impacts on the basis that HMT/OBR can cover these)
> •	What can be delivered under a first phase of the work (e.g. a [6] month timeline).
> 
> 
> 6. Tasks
> 
> We’ve discussed splitting the work in to two phases.
> 
> Phase 1
> An initial [6]-month phase which looks at rapidly bringing together evidence on the impacts of climate damage and incorporates these into a macroeconomic modelling framework, working with macro modellers to generate UK-wide impacts (i.e. question a).
> 
> Success criteria:
> •	New dataset set out in spreadsheet with time series of economic impacts broken down by sector, in a format in which it can be built into a macro model.
> •	New inputs on international risks / spillovers in a format which can be integrated.
> •	Plan in train for incorporating these into a macro modelling framework, ideally with initial results.
> 
> We think this is achievable because the existing LSE Grantham study already brings together a lot of the useful UK-specific data. Nicola’s Nature GFI study is a great example of what you can do on international supply chain impacts within a 6-12 month window (as well as a great test case for using a hybrid approach).
> 
> Phase 2
> Expanding the scope to cover question c in particular.
> 
> 7. Governance
> We would be happy to participate by way of steering group, alongside a number of other public bodies and experts, to maximise the policy relevance of the work and ensure it is built into our work (e.g. forecasting, framing of green growth, link to how we estimate indirect effects on the fiscal side, potentially also growth metrics).
> 
> As a core user group, I think you want:
> •	HMT (mix of teams, including EGU and Economic Risks)
> •	OBR (suggest Alison Todd)
> •	Defra (Ashley Diggins).
> 
> We could consider adding CCC, Met Office and BoE (we can suggest contacts again).
> 
> Jenny has some leave planned in Q1 of next year, but can add touchpoints for this work.

> **Theory of Change and Strategy**
> 
> **Theory of Change:**  
> The objective of accurately assessing and managing the economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK hinges on integrating sector-specific climate impact data into a comprehensive macroeconomic framework. By enhancing the precision and relevance of climate damage scenarios, we can illuminate the macroeconomic and fiscal ramifications more effectively. This understanding will empower policymakers to make informed decisions about adaptation strategies, ultimately leading to reduced economic volatility and fiscal risk associated with climate change.
> 
> The core theory is that by leveraging a hybrid modelling approach—synthesizing the best UK sector models with international spillover insights and embedding them into a macroeconomic framework—policymakers will gain a nuanced understanding of both direct and indirect climate risks. This knowledge will be instrumental for making evidence-based decisions that maximize the benefits of adaptation actions on a national scale.
> 
> Further, strengthening the evidence base on adaptation benefits will encourage timely investments, thus avoiding deferred costs and supporting sustainable growth pathways. By developing transparent and adaptable modelling tools and methodologies, we foster a robust platform for continuous improvements and international knowledge exchange.
> 
> **Strategy:**  
> We will execute our theory of change through the following strategic elements:
> 
> 1. **Consolidating Sectoral Expertise**: Collaborate with experts from UK-focused climate research projects and utilize established databases and sector models, such as those from the Grantham study. This ensures that we have reliable, representative, and detailed input data for the UK scenarios.
> 
> 2. **Developing Hybrid Macroeconomic Models**: Integrate the consolidated sectoral data into a dynamic macroeconomic modelling framework such as NiGEM, which will be refined to better capture UK-specific climate risks and international spillovers.
> 
> 3. **Fostering Stakeholder Engagement**: Establish an active steering group comprising key government bodies (HMT, OBR, Defra), academic institutions, and think tanks to guide the research, ensure policy relevance, and embed insights into standard decision-making processes.
> 
> 4. **Producing Adaptable Tools and Methodologies**: Develop open-source tools and methodologies that allow for regular updates when new evidence becomes available. This ensures the models remain relevant and useful for policymaking.
> 
> 5. **Implementing a Scenario-Based Approach**: Formulate multiple climate damage scenarios, aligning them with potential adaptation strategies, to evaluate the effectiveness and fiscal implications of differing pathways. This will include exploring high-risk scenarios like AMOC collapse to anticipate and plan for extreme outcomes.
> 
> 6. **Building Capacity for In-House Modelling**: Train government bodies, including the OBR, to run these models internally, enhancing their capacity to apply the research outcomes directly to policymaking.
> 
> 7. **Facilitating International Collaboration and Learning**: Engage with international bodies, sharing tools and insights to enable other countries to adopt similar frameworks for assessing their climate risks and designing appropriate adaptation strategies.
> 
> The strategy ensures our theory of change is robustly addressed, leading to actionable climate risk assessments and effective adaptation investment, fostering a resilient economic future for the UK in the face of climate challenges.
