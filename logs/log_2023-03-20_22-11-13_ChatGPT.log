> Process-based Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), such as IMAGE, typically simulate the interactions between human and natural systems, including the economy, energy, land use, and climate. These models are used to explore different scenarios of future development pathways and to evaluate the impacts of various policies and measures on the environment, society, and the economy.
> 
> Negative-cost mitigation options are those measures that have a net economic benefit, which means that they not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also generate savings or other economic benefits that exceed their costs. These measures can include, for example, energy efficiency improvements, which reduce energy use and costs, or the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, which reduce both emissions and fuel costs.
> 
> In process-based IAMs like IMAGE, negative-cost mitigation options are typically represented as endogenous or exogenous measures that affect the behavior of economic agents, such as firms, households, and governments. These measures can be modeled explicitly or implicitly, depending on the level of detail and complexity of the model.
> 
> Explicit modeling of negative-cost mitigation options involves the representation of specific measures or policies, such as energy efficiency standards, renewable energy subsidies, or carbon pricing. These measures are typically incorporated into the model's sectoral and regional modules, which simulate the behavior of different economic agents and their interactions in the energy, industry, transport, and residential sectors.
> 
> Implicit modeling of negative-cost mitigation options involves the representation of broader trends or drivers that lead to the adoption of these measures, such as technological progress, market competition, or social norms. These trends are typically captured by the model's assumptions about the evolution of technology, prices, and consumer preferences, which affect the demand and supply of different goods and services.
> 
> In both cases, the impact of negative-cost mitigation options on emissions and economic outcomes is typically evaluated using various indicators, such as the cost of carbon abatement, the net present value of emissions reductions, or the macroeconomic impacts of policy measures.
> 
> Overall, process-based IAMs like IMAGE provide a flexible and transparent framework for exploring the potential of negative-cost mitigation options in different sectors and regions and for informing policy decisions on climate change mitigation and sustainable development.

> In particular, will process-based IAMs take negative-cost mitigation options under a carbon price of 0, even though we do not see these taken up in the real world?
**assistant**:
> In process-based IAMs, negative-cost mitigation options are usually considered even when a carbon price is set to zero. This is because these models aim to explore the full range of possible mitigation options and their potential impacts, regardless of whether they are currently being taken up in the real world.
> 
> However, it is important to note that the actual implementation of negative-cost mitigation options in the real world can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as market barriers, policy and regulatory frameworks, and social and cultural norms. Therefore, the uptake of these measures may not always correspond to their theoretical potential as estimated by IAMs.
> 
> Moreover, process-based IAMs typically do not provide a deterministic or prescriptive view of the future, but rather simulate a range of scenarios and uncertainties that reflect the inherent complexity and variability of socio-economic and environmental systems. As such, the results of these models should be interpreted with caution and used as a basis for informed decision-making rather than as a definitive prediction of the future.
> 
> Overall, while process-based IAMs can provide valuable insights into the potential of negative-cost mitigation options, their implementation and effectiveness in the real world are subject to various contextual and institutional factors that are beyond the scope of the models.
