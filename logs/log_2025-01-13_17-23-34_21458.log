> Is there a standard library in python to load an "asc" file? Such files begin with lines like this:
> ```
> ncols         4320
> nrows         2160
> xllcorner     -180
> yllcorner     -90
> cellsize      0.083333333333333
> NODATA_value  -9

> I want to ultimately have the data in this as a layer in an xarray dataset.
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use the `rasterio` library to load "asc" files, which are also known as ASCII grid files. Once you've read the data with `rasterio`, you can convert it into an `xarray` dataset. Here's a general approach to accomplish that:
> 
> 1. **Install rasterio**: If you haven't already, install `rasterio` using pip:
> 
>    ```bash
>    pip install rasterio
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Read the ASC file**: Use `rasterio.open()` to read the .asc file.
> 
> 3. **Convert to xarray**: Use the `rioxarray` interface to convert the data to an `xarray` object.
> 
> Here is a sample code that demonstrates this process:
> 
> ```python
> import rasterio
> import rioxarray
> 
> # Open the ASC file with rasterio
> with rasterio.open('your_file.asc') as src:
>     # Read the data as an xarray DataArray
>     data_array = rioxarray.open_rasterio(src)
> 
> # Now you have an xarray DataArray object
> # You can manipulate or access it like any xarray object
> print(data_array)
> 
> # If you need to convert it to a Dataset
> data_set = data_array.to_dataset(name='variable_name')
> ```
> 
> This code assumes the .asc file format is compatible with rasterio. If you have special requirements (like specific nodata handling), you may need to adjust those during the reading process. The use of `rioxarray.open_rasterio` will automatically handle metadata conversion and enable easier integration into an `xarray` workflow.
