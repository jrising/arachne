**user**:
> What is the phrase for the time something is in a reservoir or bucket?
**assistant**:
> The phrase you're thinking of is likely "residence time." In the field of hydrology, geology, or physical geography, the term refers to the average time a molecule of water (or another substance) spends within a particular reservoir or system. It's often used to gain insights about the dynamics and behavior of different elements within that system.
