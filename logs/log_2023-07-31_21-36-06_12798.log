> I believe that Plato called death the "beautiful risk"-- something like kalos caldunos-- probably in the Phaedo. Can you confirm?

> I reviewed Plato's "Phaedo," but I am not able to find any direct referral ascribed to Plato of death being referred to as the "beautiful risk" (*kalos clydonos*, assuming your terms are Greek) in any known translation or interpretation. In "Phaedo," Plato discusses death and the imperishability of the soul from Socrates’ perspective, but there doesn't seem to be a phrase that directly matches your description.

> As you know, figurative interpretations of ancient texts can vary among scholars and translators, but I'm unable to find a recognized interpretation that fits your exact phrase. Perhaps you've conflated a couple of different sources or translations? It may also be the case that this phrase is derived from secondary commentary on Plato's works rather than from Plato himself.

> In Greek letters, "kalos caldunos" would be written as "καλὸς καλδοῦνος".
