> Models that exhibit such tipping points are characterized by abrupt changes once the threshold is crossed, and even

**assistant**:
> I can certainly summarize the information provided in the excerpt from the IPCC AR6 report concerning tipping points and the degree of confidence associated with each. Please remember that these are summaries and not exhaustive descriptions of the processes involved. 
> 
> 1. **Slowly-responding processes** like deep ocean overturning circulation and ice sheets are already underway to irreversible changes due to past and present emissions. There is very high confidence in this.
> 
> 2. Based on the paleoclimate record, there's potential for **sudden shifts** (or tipping points) in the climate system. There's very high confidence that some responses from deep ocean warming, acidification, sea level rise will keep changing for millennia after surface temperature stabilize and are irreversible on human timescales.
> 
> 3. **Abrupt changes at regional scales** and the existence of tipping points cannot be excluded with high confidence. Some of these changes could lead to extreme climate conditions and weather-like increased frequency of droughts and fires.
> 
> 4. For the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**, there is evidence suggesting that it often recovers after temperature stabilization with a time delay (low confidence). In contrast, there is high confidence for substantial irreversibilities in ocean acidification, ocean warming, sea level rise, and some cryosphere changes.
> 
> 5. In scenarios of stabilization of global warming at **1.5°C, 2.0°C, or 3.0°C**, the weakening and then recovery of the AMOC is anticipated (medium confidence). Under sustained warming between 2°C and 3°C, it is highly likely the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets would be almost completely and irreversibly lost over multiple millennia. Varying levels of confidence are given for losses at warmer levels.
> 
> 6. For **global warming up to 2°C** above 1850-1900 levels, paleoclimate records do not support abrupt changes in the carbon cycle (low confidence). High confidence exists in associated rise in global mean sea level and increase in global ocean heat content continuing for centuries to millennia.
> 
> 7. **Biogeochemical cycles** could undergo abrupt changes at regional scales, with likelihood increasing with climate change (high confidence). While the release of methane from permafrost and subsea clathrates is very unlikely during this century, potential abrupt changes in biogeochemical cycles contribute to uncertainties in GHG concentrations.
> 
> 8. Limited confidence exists (low) in the **Amazon rainforest** tipping into a dry state within the 21st century due to a combined pressure from deforestation and warming climate.
> 
> In summary, the certainty varies greatly by tipping point and typically falls into low, medium, or high confidence levels, which is computed based on the amount and quality of research available.
