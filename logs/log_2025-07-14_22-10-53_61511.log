> Market damages are those climate damages affecting economic activity mediated by money. Market damages do not include estimates of the welfare cost of climate change outside markets, for example loss of human life or damages to ecosystems that can be priced at people's willingness to pay (WTP) to preserve those ecosystems' existence. `Non-market' damages are more uncertain than their market counterparts, but in many IAMs they occupy a substantial share of total welfare damages from climate change \citep[e.g.][]{nordhaus2000warning, Rennert2022}.
> 
> The current estimate of non-market damages in PAGE have not been recently calibrated. As part of a separate project, we have implemented non-market damages using the structure described by the MERGE IAM \citep{manne2005merge}, with an updated calibration derived from \citet{howard2017few}. The MERGE model places particular emphasis on the representation of non-market damages, with a WTP measure that depends on both income and temperature. While the parameters of the MERGE non-market damage module are speculative, its use of an S-shaped elasticity of WTP with respect to income is theoretically coherent. 
> 
> Like the MERGE model, the damage function meta-analysis by \citet{howard2017few} assumes that damages grow quadratically with warming from a pre-industrial baseline. Under their preferred model, total damages as a percent of GDP (including market and non-market impacts) follow $\num{0.595} \Delta \overline{T_{AT}}(t)^2$. Considering only damage functions that exclude non-market damages, their key coefficient is reduced by \num{0.487}.\footnote{This coefficient comes from table 2, column 3 of \citet{howard2017few}. While their preferred model is column 4, that model has a market-only reduction of \num{0.622}, larger than the total damage coefficient. Columns 3 and 4 estimate identical values for the total damage coefficient, so we use the more conservative value.} We use this as evidence that non-market damages follow $\num{0.487} \Delta \overline{T_{AT}}(t)^2$. As in \citet{howard2017few}, we increase this coefficient by 25\%, to $\num{0.609}$, to account for potential omitted (non-catastrophic) damages. This gives a 90\% increase in WTP relative to \citet{manne2005merge}. At 2.5$^{\circ}$C warming, WTP is 3.8\% of GDP, compared to 2.0\% in the original MERGE calibration (see Figure \ref{fig:merge-dmgfunc}).

> This WTP applies at high incomes. MERGE provides a model to link WTP to income, which we maintain. At \$25k/capita, WTP to avoid 2.5$^{\circ}$C warming is held at 1\%. As income increases above that level, WTP asymptotically approaches the non-market damages from \citet{howard2017few}. WTP to avoid warming as a function of income is shown in Figure \ref{fig:merge-scurve}.

> We derive a new estimate of non-market damages using the meta-analysis by \citet{howard2017few}. This approach integrates the MERGE IAM model's structure and employs an updated calibration reflecting current data. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) metric, vital for estimating non-market damages, considers both income and temperature effects. The model assumes non-market damages grow quadratically with warming, and our updated calculations show that at 2.5$^{\circ}$C warming, WTP is 3.8% of GDP. We further relate WTP to national income levels using a hockey-stick function to reflect rapid increases in non-market damages at extreme temperatures. More details are available in SI \ref{sec:update-nonmarket}.

> The Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) has been built to study the impacts of sea level rise on coastlines worldwide, under different assumptions about adaptation that include the possibility of optimal (least-cost) adaptation planning. The model was introduced and is described in detail in \citet{diaz2016estimating}. The data and implementation that we rely upon here is drawn from \citet{depsky2023dscim}, updated as part of the Climate Impact Lab's Social Cost of Carbon work.
> 
> CIAM works at a high spatial resolution by building on the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) database \citep{hinkel2009integrating}. DIVA partitions the world’s coastlines into \num{12148} segments with homogeneous physical characteristics. The median length of a segment is 18km. South Korea's coastline, for example, is divided into \num{105} segments. Cost estimates at the segment level can be aggregated to coarser spatial scales, for example the country and global levels. CIAM runs in time steps of 10 years. It is initialised in the year 2000 and can run up to 2200, though we mainly focus on the period up to 2100. The base year currency is 2010 US dollars.
> 
> Each segment in CIAM is described by its physical attributes (coastline length, surface area by elevation, storm surge frequency, wetland extent), socio-economic attributes (income, population density, capital stock), as well as protection costs. Physical attributes are taken from DIVA, while socio-economic attributes and protection costs are derived from a range of sources described in \citet{diaz2016estimating}. While some segment attributes such as length are time-invariant, most are time-varying. Future segment population is based on the United Nations’ projections, while future segment income is based on IMF projections.
> 
> There are five categories of coastal impact in CIAM:
> \begin{itemize}
> \item Protection costs (construction of sea walls, dikes, etc.);
> \item Retreat costs (relocating people and mobile capital inland, and demolishing immobile capital);
> \item Inundation costs (the value of lost land, and immobile capital abandoned);
> \item Wetland costs (the value of lost wetland ecosystem services);
> \item Flood costs (expected damage to capital stocks and expected mortality from storm surges).
> \end{itemize}
> 
> The overall cost of sea level rise is the sum of each of these five cost categories, the first two of which can be regarded as adaptation costs, while the latter three can be regarded as residual damages.
> 
> Both overall costs and their composition depends on what is assumed about adaptation. In general, each segment possesses a social planner who solves the following optimisation problem for his/her own segment:
> \begin{align*}
> \text{OverallCost} =& \min_s \sum_{t \in \Delta t} \left[\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}\left(\text{ProtectionCost}_{st} + \text{RetreatCost}_{st} + \right.\right.\\
> & \left.\left.\text{InundationCost}_{st} +\text{WetlandCost}_{st} + \text{FloodCost}_{st} \right)\right]
> \end{align*}
> where $s$ is the adaptation strategy, $\Delta t$ is the adaptation planning period comprising decadal time-steps $t$, and $r$ is the discount rate.
> 
> When the adaptation strategy $s$ corresponds to no adaptation, $\text{ProtectionCost}_t = 0$ for all $t$ and $\text{RetreatCost}_t$ is optimally chosen to react to sea level rise at the same time step. Alternatively, when $s$ corresponds to optimal adaptation, both $\text{ProtectionCost}$ and $\text{RetreatCost}$ are chosen once during each adaptation planning period in order to minimise the discounted $\text{OverallCost}$ of sea level rise in the current and next adaptation planning periods.
> 
> This problem is solved independently for each of CIAM’s \num{12148} segments and sequentially for each adaptation planning period. Thus, when adapting optimally the planner looks forward one period in each planning period. Perfect foresight is assumed, which is unrealistic but necessary for computational tractability given so many optimisation problems are being solved simultaneously. The default adaptation planning periods are 40 years, with shorter initial and final periods, i.e.: 2000; 2010-2040; 2050-2090; 2100-2140; 2150-2180; 2190-2200.

> 
> The Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) evaluates the impacts of sea level rise on global coastlines, incorporating various adaptation strategies, including optimal (least-cost) planning. CIAM is built on the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) database, segmenting coastlines into over 12,000 segments with homogeneous physical characteristics. Each segment's attributes include physical and socio-economic factors, with costs associated with protection, retreat, inundation, wetland loss, and flooding.
> 
> The model estimates overall costs based on an optimization problem for each segment's social planner, balancing adaptation costs against residual damages. CIAM assumes perfect foresight within adaptation planning periods, typically spanning 40 years. Results from both unadapted and optimally adapted scenarios illustrate the projected global damages from sea-level rise and storm surges. More details can be found in \citet{depsky2023dscim} and related references.
