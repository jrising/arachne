> Dear Professor Rising,
> I hope you are doing well. My name is Javad Teymoori, and I am a master's student at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Connecticut. I am writing to inform you that I am interested in applying for a Ph.D. position in your department at the University of Delaware for Fall 2025.
> With my background and research experience in hydrological modeling, surface and groundwater interactions, climate modeling, flood modeling, water quality, and water resource management, I am very excited about the possibility of working under your guidance.
> Currently, I am studying for a master's degree and working on the interaction between land and atmosphere using land surface models, focusing on the effects of vegetation feedback on future droughts in the United States with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). I am processing high-resolution atmospheric forcing data( 3-Hourly Daymet4 data with 1km resolution) and using them to run CTSM( Community Terrestrial System Model) to capture the flash drought and other climatic variables before, during, and after the extreme events in the U.S.   My previous master's degree in Hydraulic and Water Resources Engineering from the University of Tehran further strengthened my expertise in hydrology and water resource management. For my master's thesis, I developed a framework for Artificial Groundwater Recharge (AGR) site selection using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Additionally, I assessed its effects on groundwater levels using the SWAT model, which is coupled with a 2-D numerical model in MATLAB (developed by myself), investigating the interaction between surface water and groundwater and their implications for water sustainability.
> I am particularly interested in integrating machine learning, data science, remote sensing techniques, and satellite products into Hydrological and Land atmosphere modeling. My research experiences include evaluating precipitation, Extreme events, Flood modeling, soil moisture, and groundwater and studying land use and land cover changes; as highlighted in my publications, I have applied these methods to hydrological models for extreme events such as floods, stormwater, and droughts. My commitment to advancing knowledge in hydrological sciences is demonstrated by my publishing six papers, especially about precipitation, extreme events, and drought, in high-quality journals.
> I have attached my CV and a link to my Google Scholar profile. I am available daily and would be delighted to meet with you to discuss my background, research interests, and potential contributions to your work in more detail. 
>  It is worth mentioning that I am currently in the United States and do not face any issues obtaining a visa to enter the country. I can prepare myself and be available to start the program at your university in Fall 2025.  
> Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to talking with you more about my application.
>  Best regards,

> Dear Javad,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in pursuing a PhD in our department. I thoroughly appreciate the detailed insight into your impressive background and research experiences.
> 
> However, I must inform you that, unfortunately, we no longer have available PhD slots for Fall 2025. Our funding opportunities for incoming PhD students are limited this year.
> 
> I encourage you to explore other potential opportunities and continue your pursuit of integrating machine learning, data science, and remote sensing into hydrological and land atmosphere modeling. Your skills and research achievements will surely be a great asset in this field.
> 
> If you would like to discuss further or have any other questions, feel free to schedule a time to chat with me by using this link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).
