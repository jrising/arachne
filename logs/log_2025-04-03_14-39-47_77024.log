> I'm working with some people who do a lot with the UN and with finance ministers, and the keep talking about "the spring meetings". I think these might take place in DC and NYC? I'm not sure what they're talking about.

> It sounds like they are referring to the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group. These meetings typically take place in April every year, primarily in Washington, D.C. They gather central bankers, finance ministers, private sector executives, and academics to discuss global economic issues, development, and finance.

> The Spring Meetings are an important event on the international financial calendar, where key policy discussions and decisions often take shape, which might explain why they're frequently mentioned in conversations involving the UN and finance ministers. If your work intersects with global economic policy, attending these meetings or staying informed about their discussions could be quite beneficial.
