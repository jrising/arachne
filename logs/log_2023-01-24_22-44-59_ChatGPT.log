> When a groundwater reservoir is closed to natural replenishment, it is called an "artificially confined aquifer" or "artificially confined groundwater."
**user**:
> What is a confined aquifer?
**assistant**:
> A confined aquifer is an aquifer that is located beneath an impermeable layer, such as clay or rock, and is under pressure. Because it is confined, the water in a confined aquifer cannot rise to the surface and instead is forced to flow through the permeable rock or sand that makes up the aquifer. Confined aquifers are also called "artesian aquifers" because the water in them is under pressure and can flow to the surface without pumping if the confining layer is penetrated.

> What is the opposite of a confined aquifer?
**assistant**:
> The opposite of a confined aquifer is an unconfined or "water table" aquifer. An unconfined aquifer is an aquifer that is not located beneath an impermeable layer and is not under pressure. Because it is unconfined, the water in an unconfined aquifer can rise to the surface and is not forced to flow through the permeable rock or sand that makes up the aquifer. The upper surface of the saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer is called the water table.

> How quickly can rainfall reach an unconfined aquifer?
**assistant**:
> The rate at which rainfall can reach an unconfined aquifer depends on a variety of factors, including the permeability of the soil and rock above the aquifer, the slope of the land, and the amount of vegetation cover. In general, the rate of infiltration (the process by which water enters the soil) is faster in sandy or gravelly soils than in clay soils, and faster on sloped land than on flat land. Vegetation can also help to increase infiltration by breaking up the soil and providing channels for water to flow through.
> 
> In an unconfined aquifer, the water table will rise as water infiltrates into the ground, and the water table will fall as water is pumped out or as it evaporates. The rate of recharge, or how quickly the aquifer is replenished, can vary considerably depending on the location and climate, but it is generally slower than the rate of discharge, or how quickly water is withdrawn.
> 
> In some cases, the water table can rise quickly, such as during heavy rainfall or rapid snowmelt, but it can also take a long time for the water table to recharge if there is low precipitation or high water usage.

> How are water rights determined in the Western US?
**assistant**:
> Water rights in the Western United States are primarily determined by a system of prior appropriation, also known as "first in time, first in right." This system holds that the first person to use water for a beneficial purpose, such as irrigation or hydroelectric power, has the right to continue using that water, as long as they continue to use it beneficially and do not waste it. 
> 
> In this system, water rights are divided into two main categories: surface water and groundwater. Surface water rights are determined by the state, and are often allocated based on the amount of water that can be reasonably and beneficially used. Groundwater rights, on the other hand, are generally considered to be property rights, and are subject to state laws and regulations. 
> 
> Water rights are also subject to the doctrine of "beneficial use," which holds that water can only be claimed for uses that are beneficial to society, such as irrigation, domestic use, or industrial use. Additionally, the doctrine of "prior appropriation" holds that the right to use water is based on the first use of water, and not on land ownership. This means that a landowner may not have the right to use water on their land if they did not use it first. 
> 
> It is worth noting that water rights laws and regulations can be complex and vary from state to state, and it's best to consult with a water rights expert or attorney for more information about the specifics in your area.
