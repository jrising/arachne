> This disconnect is, amongst other causes, responsible for

> impacts of climate change and the underlying science.

> The findings of physical climate science over recent

> very serious risks to human societies and ecosystems
> from current and future climate change. This has
> underpinned calls for strong mitigation and adaptation
> action. For example, the Sixth Assessment Report of
> the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
> states that “Climate change is a threat to human well-being
> and planetary health (very high confidence). There is a
> rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable
> and sustainable future for all (very high confidence).”
> It also states: “Deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and
> accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this
> decade would reduce projected losses and damages
> for humans and ecosystems (very high confidence),
> and deliver many co-benefits, especially for air quality
> and health (high confidence)”1. The findings of physical

> In the piece, I want to briefly describe the prevailing perspectives in these communities, as a way to communicate the "long-term disconnect" described in the Introduction above. Here is my current attempt. Can you provide thoughts on edits or other points to include?
> 
> The natural science perspective: There exists an imminent risk of pervasive, long-term disruption of the environment due to continued GHG emissions. Impacts are non-linear, so that warming beyond 1.5°C will result in significant, systemic, and unforeseen disruptions in the systems that people rely upon. This will have potentially dire consequences for vulnerable communities worldwide. As a result, the scientific consensus advocates for rapid decarbonization.
> 
> The economic perspective: Economists largely agree that benefits of substantial decarbonization outweigh its costs, and a suite of policies should be enacted to reduce further warming. However, poverty reduction is also a priority, with large, immediate effects including a greater resilience to climate impacts. The observed capacity of humans to adapt suggests that no likely climate impacts will undermine sustained economic growth, so any transition to a green economy should similarly avoid doing so.
> 
> Immediately after this, I will say:
> Rather than suggesting that these are two extremes on an alarmism spectrum, we find compelling points in each.

> Your summary of the prevailing perspectives in the natural science and economics communities effectively convey the "long-term disconnect." Here are a few suggestions to enhance clarity, alignment, and inclusiveness:
> 
> The natural science perspective: This community highlights the urgent threat of pervasive and lasting environmental disruption owing to protracted greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They argue that the impacts are non-linear, suggesting the escalation beyond 1.5°C may trigger significant, systemic, and unforeseen disruptions to the essential systems humans depend on. Such changes could bring dire consequences, especially to vulnerable communities worldwide. Consequently, this community has reached the consensus that the call for immediate and drastic decarbonization is paramount.
> 
> The economic perspective: Economists broadly concur that the advantages of substantial decarbonization outweigh its costs and assert that a variety of policies should be implemented to mitigate further warming. They also underscore the importance of poverty alleviation due to its immediate and profound impacts, including enhancing resilience to climate consequences. Economists recognize the human capability to adapt, interpreting this as evidence that no foreseeable climate impacts will obstruct sustained economic growth. Therefore, they propose that just as robust economic growth should be preserved, the transition to a green economy should uphold the same principle.
> 
> Following this contrasting stance, I venture to say: Instead of positing these perspectives as mere ends of an alarmism spectrum, we discern value in each one. These viewpoints provide insight into distinct but equally consequential considerations for our global future, underscoring the need for increased collaboration and integration in our pursuit of sustainability.
