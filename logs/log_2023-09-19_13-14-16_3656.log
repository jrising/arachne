**user**:
> In ggplot, it seems like alpha only applies to the fill of a feature and not to its border color. How can I apply alpha to a border color?
**assistant**:
> In ggplot, the `alpha` aesthetic parameter applies transparency only to the fill color of a feature, not to its border color. If you want to apply transparency to the border color as well, you can achieve this by using a combination of the `color` and `alpha` aesthetics.
> 
> To apply alpha to the border color, you can set the `color` aesthetic to the desired color and adjust its transparency using the `alpha` aesthetic. Here's an example of how you can do this:
> 
> ```R
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Create a scatterplot with a border color using alpha
> ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
>   geom_point(size = 3, aes(color = Species, fill = Species), shape = 21, stroke = 1) +
>   scale_color_manual(values = c("setosa" = "red", "versicolor" = "blue", "virginica" = "green"),
>                      guide = guide_legend(title = "Species", override.aes = list(alpha = 0.5))) +
>   scale_fill_manual(values = c("setosa" = "red", "versicolor" = "blue", "virginica" = "green"),
>                     guide = guide_none()) +
>   theme_classic()
> ```
> 
> In this example, the `color` aesthetic is used to define the border color of the points, while the `fill` aesthetic sets the fill color. By adjusting the `alpha` parameter within the `scale_color_manual()` function, you control the transparency of the border color.
> 
> Feel free to modify the example to suit your specific plot and color preferences.
**user**:
> What if I want my alpha to be determined by one of the aesthetics?
**assistant**:
> If you want the transparency (`alpha`) of the border color to be determined by one of the aesthetics in your plot, you can achieve that by mapping the `alpha` aesthetic to that specific variable.
> 
> Here's an example using the `mtcars` dataset where the `alpha` of the border color is determined by the `cyl` variable:
> 
> ```R
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) +
>   geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl), fill = factor(cyl)),
>              shape = 21, size = 4, stroke = 1, alpha = 0.8) +
>   scale_color_manual(values = c("4" = "red", "6" = "green", "8" = "blue"),
>                      guide = guide_legend(title = "Cylinders")) +
>   scale_fill_manual(values = c("4" = "red", "6" = "green", "8" = "blue"),
>                     guide = guide_none()) +
>   theme_classic()
> ```
> 
> In this example, the `color` aesthetic is mapped to the `factor(cyl)` variable, indicating that each level of `cyl` will have a different border color. By setting `alpha = 0.8`, all the border colors will have a constant transparency level.
> 
> If you want the transparency level to be determined by the `cyl` variable, you can map the `alpha` aesthetic to `factor(cyl)` as well:

>                     guide = guide_none()) +
>   theme_classic()
> ```
> 
> In this updated example, the `alpha` aesthetic is mapped to `factor(cyl)`, which results in different transparency levels based on the `cyl` variable.
> 
> Feel free to adapt these examples to your specific needs
**user**:
> I think that in the new example, I will again have alpha only apply to the fill. In my case, I actually have fill=NA, so it is just the colour that I want to apply an alpha to, according to aesthetics.
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the confusion. If you want the `alpha` to apply only to the color (border), while keeping the fill as `NA`, you can achieve that by mapping the `alpha` aesthetic to your desired variable and setting the `fill` to a constant `NA` value.
> 
> Here's an example using the `mtcars` dataset, where the `alpha` of the border color is determined by the `cyl` variable while keeping the fill as `NA`:

> 
> In this example, the `fill` aesthetic is set to `NA`, which means no fill color will be applied to the points. The `color` aesthetic is mapped to the `factor(cyl)` variable, providing different border colors based on the `cyl` values. The `alpha` aesthetic is also mapped to `factor(cyl)`, resulting in different transparency levels for the border color based on the `cyl` variable.
