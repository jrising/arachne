> How have you been doing?
> I saw your text "Weather and Climate Data Basics" on the following site: https://climateestimate.net/content/netcdfs-and-basic-coding.html.
> My name is Camilla Kassar. I've been working on climate data for a few months. but I'm having difficulty extracting CMIP6 data (HadGEM air temperature model - Tas) from a shapefile using code in Python.
> I used this shapefile to extract ERA data and it worked. But with the CMP6 data, this did not happen. The code seems working without errors appearing. But, the saved file does not contain the data, just the header. Please, could you help me? If yes, can I send you the files (code and sample data) for better understanding?

> Hi Camilla,
> 
> You only sent the .shp file, not the full shapefile, so I can't open this. But I have two theories for why things aren't working, and you can test them.
> 
> 1. The longitude values in your HadGEM datafile are only positive (so, São Paulo would correspond to a longitude greater than 180), while the longitudes in your shapefile might be negative. I don't see any logic in your python code that would correct for this.
> 
> 2. Even if this isn't a problem, it's possible that there are no cells centers contained within the São Paulo polygon. The HadGEM grid cells are 1.9° wide, so it's fairly easy for small regions to get missed, if you only account for the grid centers (which is what I see in the code).

> Hi Camilla,
> 
> GCM data is described according to a latitude-longitude grid. You would only need a coordinate project system like WGS 84 if you wanted to plot the results on a 2-D map or know exactly how far different points in lat/lon are from each other.

> Dear Camilla,
> 
> It's been a pleasure assisting you in working through some of the challenges related to extracting CMIP6 data. It seems that these are quite fundamental issues in working with such datasets. 
> 
> I'm more than happy to provide some guidance. However, it may be beneficial for you in the long term to find a local group or mentor who could provide you with regular assistance. There are numerous meteorological and climate data analysis groups out there who could provide advice and support. 
> 
> Additionally, online forums and platforms such as StackOverflow and the Earth Science Stack Exchange community are also invaluable resources for troubleshooting and learning. The contributors there often provide a variety of perspectives and solutions that may be beneficial for your work.
> 
> If you'd like a more in-depth discussion about these issues, I'm available for a Zoom chat too. You can schedule a time at the following link: https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0.
> 
> I hope these suggestions are helpful, and I encourage you to keep progressing with your work on climate data. It's vital research.
