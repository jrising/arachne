> I have a chunk of LaTeX that I would like to make available as a navigable webpage. It has several subsections, figures, and equations. The documentation describes a model that is written in Julia, and I have seen elsewhere people use Documenter.jl to produce documentation sites that look good, but (1) the documentation isn't built into the model code, so I don't need/want that kind of feature, and (2) an Documenter.jl site I see has the material in markdown, rather than LaTeX, and I want to keep it in LaTeX. What do you suggest as a way to set this up?
**assistant**:
> Given your requirements, here are a couple of approaches you might consider to convert your LaTeX document into a navigable webpage:
> 
> ### 1. **Pandoc**
> Pandoc is a versatile document converter that can handle LaTeX and convert it into HTML, which you can then style with CSS for better navigation and appearance.
> 
> **Steps:**
> 1. **Install Pandoc:** If you haven't already, you can install Pandoc from [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
> 2. **Convert LaTeX to HTML:**
>    ```bash
>    pandoc your_document.tex -o your_document.html
>    ```
> 3. **Add Navigation and Styling:**
>    - Customize the HTML output with a navigation menu for sections and subsections.
>    - Add CSS for styling.
> 
> ### 2. **Sphinx with reStructuredText**
> Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator originally created for Python documentation but can be used with various languages. It supports LaTeX through reStructuredText (reST).
> 
> **Steps:**
> 1. **Install Sphinx:** You can install Sphinx using pip.
>    ```bash
>    pip install sphinx
>    ```
> 2. **Create a Sphinx Project:**
>    ```bash
>    sphinx-quickstart
>    ```
>    Follow the prompts to set up the documentation structure.
> 3. **Write reStructuredText:**
>    - Convert your LaTeX document to reST using a converter (e.g., `latex2rst`).
>    - Include your LaTeX equations and figures within the reST files.
> 4. **Build the HTML Documentation:**
>    ```bash
>    make html
>    ```
> 
> ### 3. **Jupyter Book**
> Jupyter Book is an excellent tool for creating online books with Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown, and it supports LaTeX.
> 
> **Steps:**
> 1. **Install Jupyter Book:**
>    ```bash
>    pip install -U jupyter-book
>    ```
> 2. **Create a Jupyter Book:**
>    ```bash
>    jupyter-book create mybook/
>    ```
> 3. **Add Content:**
>    - Convert LaTeX to Markdown (through Pandoc) or directly include LaTeX in Markdown cells.
>    - Place your content in the `mybook` directory.
> 4. **Build the Book:**
>    ```bash
>    jupyter-book build mybook/
>    ```
> 
> ### Recommendation
> If your primary goal is to keep the content in LaTeX while making it navigable and visually appealing as a website, **Pandoc** is likely the most straightforward solution. It directly converts LaTeX files into HTML, preserving your equations and figures. You can then enhance the HTML with CSS and JavaScript for better navigation.
> 
> ### Additional Tips
> - **Navigation:** Add internal links and a sidebar for sections and subsections to improve navigation.
> - **Styling:** Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap for a responsive design.
> - **Hosting:** Host your HTML site on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static site hosting service for easy access.
> 
> Feel free to ask for more detailed steps on any specific approach!
