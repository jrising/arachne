> How can I define a function within a conditional in Julia. I have this:
> ```
>         if isa(results[:other][1], DataFrame)
>             getii(ii) = results[:other][ii]
>         elseif isa(results[:other][1][name], DataFrame)
>             getii(ii) = results[:other][ii][name]
>         else
>             return
>         end
>         println(getii(1))

> But I get that getii isn't defined.
**assistant**:
> In Julia, functions are first-class citizens, and you can define them inside conditional blocks. The issue you're encountering generally arises because the scope of the function definition is limited to the block where it's defined.

> The provided snippet should mostly work as intended. However, if you're getting a "not defined" error, there might be a problem with the broader context or other parts of the code that you're not showing. Below is an example that ensures `getii` is correctly scoped and defined:
> 
> ```julia
> getii = nothing  # Declare `getii` in the outer scope
> 
> if isa(results[:other][1], DataFrame)
>     getii = ii -> results[:other][ii]
> elseif isa(results[:other][1][name], DataFrame)
>     getii = ii -> results[:other][ii][name]
> else
>     return
> end
> 
> println(getii(1))
> ```
> 
> By initializing `getii` before the conditional statement, you ensure that it's available to be called after the conditional block. Then, you assign a lambda (anonymous function) to `getii` within the conditional blocks. This approach keeps the scope correct and addresses common scoping issues in conditional function definition in Julia.
