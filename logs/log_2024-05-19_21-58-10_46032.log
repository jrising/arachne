> What's a good way to delay import of a bunch of packages in python, since I'm not sure if they're going to be needed based on user requests?
**assistant**:
> You may want to consider delaying imports in Python by using "Lazy imports", which is the practice of only importing modules when they are actually needed. This can be accomplished by moving your `import` statements from the global scope to local scopes, such as inside functions or methods. 
> 
> Here is an example:
> 
> ```python
> def some_function():
>     import heavy_module
> 
>     heavy_module.some_method()
> ```
> 
> In this example, the module `heavy_module` is not imported when the script starts, but only when `some_function` is called.
> 
> If you need to use this approach for multiple packages and functions, you can make use of Python's `importlib` library which has an `import_module` method.
> 
> Here is an example:
> 
> ```python
> from importlib import import_module
> 
> def user_request_handler(user_request):
>     if user_request == 'do_something':
>         some_module = import_module('module_name')
>         some_module.do_something()
>     elif user_request == 'do_something_else':
>         another_module = import_module('another_module_name')
>         another_module.do_something_else()
>     # so on
> ```
> 
> In this example, when the `user_request_handler` function is called, it only imports and uses the module that is needed based on the user request.
> 
> Note: Use lazy importing sparingly. It will improve start-up time of your Python program, but it might make the program harder to read and debug because the dependencies of a module won't be clear to the reader unless they thoroughly read the entire module.
