> If I have a regression log(y) = a + b x, and then I want to predict new values for y (rather than log(y)) then I need to add in a correction of the form var(error)/2 or something like that. Does that apply to predictions where I have log(y) = a + b log(x)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, a correction similar to the one you mentioned can be applied for predictions where the dependent and independent variables have both been log-transformed, i.e., you're working with a log-log regression, also known as a double-log form such as log(y) = a + b log(x).
> 
> In the usual log-linear regression form of log(y) = a + bX + error, when a prediction for y is desired rather than log(y), without any correction, you would use the formula y = exp(predicted log(y)). When the form of error has a symmetric pattern, especially if it follows the normal distribution, the standard correction is often multiplying by exp(variance(error)/2), as you mentioned.
> 
> Now, extending this correction to the double logarithm model: if you estimate log(y) = a + b log(x), and you predict new y values for a given x, you'd still use the correction. When you transform back from the log scale after predicting in the double-log scale, you'd need to take into account the retransformation bias.

In complex cases, it may be worth considering more sophisticated methods for variance stabilizing transformations or consulting the relevant statistical literature on this topic.

> Also remember, retransformation techniques and their applicable corrections depend heavily on the validity of the model specification and error structure. It's always important to validate these before making any predictions.
