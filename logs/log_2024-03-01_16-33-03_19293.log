**user**:
> I'm trying to commit some data to a subversion repo that I haven't touched in a while, and I'm getting an error:
> ```
> % svn commit -m "sealifebase data"
> svn: E000013: Commit failed (details follow):
> svn: E000013: Can't open file '/home/jrising/svn/sdresearch/db/txn-current-lock': Permission denied
> ```
> I've checked and `/home/jrising/svn` just doesn't exist. What should I do?
**assistant**:
> There are a few potential causes of this issue that you're facing, but it most likely appears to be a repository location problem or a permission issue. 
> 
> Here's what you could do to diagnose and solve it:
> 
> 1. Check the repository location: 
> 
>    The error message indicates that SVN is trying to commit to a repository at `/home/jrising/svn/sdresearch/` which appears to no longer exist. Run `svn info` in your working directory to check the URL of the repository you're connected to. If the URL is incorrect, you'll need to relocate your working copy to the correct URL using `svn relocate`.
> 
> 2. Check the repository permission:
> 
>    If the repository does exist and it's on your machine, but perhaps at a different location, you might have permission issues. Use `ls -la` to check the permissions and owner of the repository. If they're not correct, you'll have to change the ownership to your user account using the `chown` command or change the permissions using the `chmod` command. You'll need root access to do this.
> 
> 3. Repair the repository:
> 
>    If the repository does exist at the specified location and the permissions are correct, your repository might be in an inconsistent state. In this case, the Subversion repository might need to be recovered. To do this, you can use the `svnadmin recover` command. This command should be run on the repository itself (on the server), not on a working copy.
> 
> If all these steps fail, please provide further information for more targeted assistance.

> Besides, I thought the subversion data was in the .svn directory within the folder structure that I'm at. Is it possible that /home/jrising/svn is something needed by subversion, but is not actually the subversion repo?
**assistant**:
> It seems like the repository information you're getting from `svn info` does not match the path mentioned in the error message. 
> 
> You are correct that the `.svn` directory within each working copy folder contains the subversion metadata, not a central repository location like `/home/jrising/svn`. 
> 
> It's possible that `/home/jrising/svn` was set as the repository root in the server configuration or client configuration, but it's not where your current working copy is connected. This discrepancy could be causing the permission error you encountered.
> 
> To resolve this issue, you may want to:
> 
> 1. Verify the repository URL: Double-check the Subversion server configuration or your local client configuration settings to ensure that the correct repository URL is being accessed. You can also check the configuration files (e.g., `~/.subversion/config`) for any reference to the `/home/jrising/svn` path.
> 
> 2. Update the repository location: If the repository URL is incorrect or outdated, you can update it by running `svn switch --relocate OLD_URL NEW_URL` with the old and new repository URLs. This will update your working copy to point to the correct repository location.
> 
> 3. Check server settings: If the issue persists, it could be related to server-side configuration settings. Ensure that the server configuration points to the correct repository location and that permissions are correctly set on the server side.
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the discrepancy between the repository path mentioned in the error message and the actual repository location connected to your working copy. If you continue to experience issues, you may need to consult with your Subversion server administrator for further assistance.
**user**:
> Ah, you are correct that /home/jrising/svn refers to its location on the server. And I do see it there, including the `txn-current-lock` file that it's complaining about. Should I delete that file?
**assistant**:
> It's generally not recommended to manually delete the `txn-current-lock` file in a Subversion repository, as this file is used to control write access during a commit transaction and ensure data integrity. Deleting this file could potentially lead to repository corruption or data loss.
> 
> Instead, you can try the following steps to address the permission issue with the `txn-current-lock` file:
> 
> 1. Verify ownership and permissions: Make sure that the ownership and permissions of the repository files and directories, including the `txn-current-lock` file, are set correctly. The user running the Subversion commands should have appropriate permissions to access and modify these files.
> 
> 2. Check for existing locks: Ensure that there are no stale locks on the repository that could be preventing your commit. You can use the `svn cleanup` command to attempt to remove any lingering locks on the working copy.
> 
> 3. Restart the server: If the issue persists, you may want to consider restarting the Subversion server to release any locks and allow for a fresh start.
> 
> 4. Contact your repository administrator: If you continue to encounter issues with the `txn-current-lock` file, it's advisable to contact your Subversion repository administrator for further assistance in resolving the problem.
> 
> By following these steps and exercising caution with repository files, you can help ensure the stability and integrity of your Subversion repository.

**assistant**:
> The permissions for the `db` directory in your Subversion repository appear to be set with read and write access for the owner (`jrising`) and the `pg1620784` group, and read-only access for others. This is a typical setup for a Subversion repository and seems generally appropriate.
> 
> However, the specific issue you are facing with the `txn-current-lock` file could be related to the user permissions at the time of the commit operation rather than the directory permissions.
> 
> To address the `Permission denied` error related to the `txn-current-lock` file, make sure that the user attempting to perform the commit has the necessary permissions to write to this file. If the user running the Subversion client does not have the appropriate permissions at the time of the commit, you may encounter this error.
> 
> You may also want to ensure that there are no conflicting locks on the repository that could be interfering with the commit process. Using the `svn cleanup` command on the server or the client side may help remove any stale locks.
> 
> If the issue persists, you might consider checking the Subversion server logs for any additional error messages or consulting with your Subversion repository administrator for further assistance.
> 
> Overall, the permissions on the `db` directory seem to be configured correctly for a Subversion repository, but the specific issue with the `txn-current-lock` file may require further investigation related to user permissions and locking mechanisms during commit operations.
