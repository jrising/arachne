> The page discusses the challenges and priorities for Ministries of Finance, MoFs, in addressing climate-related policies. Fiscal sustainability and economic growth are top priorities. Many MoFs are at the early stages of developing necessary climate-related analyses. There's a lack of quantification for investments needed in green transitions, and few have integrated climate considerations into core functions. Most do not use climate-economy models. MoFs face barriers such as staffing, skill constraints, and financial limitations in analytical capabilities, in addition to data gaps. Proposed solutions include better access to modeling tools, case studies, technical assistance, and knowledge sharing to bridge capability gaps across MoFs with varying needs.

> The text discusses the challenges faced by Ministries of Finance, MoFs, in developing a diverse and flexible set of analytical tools tailored to national circumstances for climate policy. MoFs benefit from external collaborations, particularly from external models. There's a need for long-term training and model transparency to adapt and refine these tools. Standardizing data sources and methodologies across government departments can improve policy proposal reviews. Despite challenges, MoFs are enhancing their analytical capabilities, creating valuable lessons for the global community. A Compendium of Practice provides in-depth examples, and further guidance will be available in a complementary paper.

> The page discusses the essential role of Ministries of Finance (MoFs) in driving the economic transformations required for green and resilient transitions across all sectors. Positioned at the intersection of economic, fiscal, and financial policy, MoFs have significant influence over national strategies and investment plans. However, many are not advancing quickly enough to meet the climate challenge. The report introduces a survey as the first systematic attempt to explore how MoFs worldwide are approaching the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. It aims to understand how climate risks and opportunities are being integrated into MoFs' analytical frameworks and to identify areas needing support. The survey addresses themes like climate-related risk assessment, policy priorities, investment evaluations, and existing analytical tools.

> The page covers the methodology and scope of a survey conducted among Ministries of Finance (MoFs) aimed at understanding their approach to integrating climate considerations into their economic models and policies. The survey specifically looks at software usage, collaboration, and climate analytics. It assesses the challenges MoFs face in mainstreaming climate factors into their work and the role the Coalition can play in helping them overcome these hurdles. The survey received responses from 59 MoFs, divided into Advanced Economies and Emerging and Developing Economies based on IMF classifications. Key findings focus on regional participation and representation in the survey and indicate areas where MoFs require more support. In addition to the survey, 15 semi-structured interviews with MoFs offer additional insights into the complexities of climate policy integration, particularly regarding the use of analytical tools, institutional politics, and external collaborations.

> Page 12 of the report highlights the awareness of Ministries of Finance regarding climate-related risks and opportunities. The page outlines the differences between physical and transition risks, which include national and global transition risks. It notes high levels of concern about physical climate risks, especially among emerging market and developing economies. Specific worries include potential impacts on GDP, government finances, and sectors threatened by extreme weather events and gradual climate change effects. The page provides statistical insights into these concerns, showing greater apprehension about government spending and GDP rather than interest rates and credit ratings.

> Page 13 focuses on the concerns of Ministries of Finance (MoFs) regarding the impacts of climate change on key macroeconomic indicators. The data reveals that these concerns are more pronounced in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) than in advanced economies (AEs), with a particular focus on physical and transition risks. MoFs from EMDEs especially emphasize concerns about government finances, GDP, and competitiveness. The table provided quantifies these concerns, using a scale from 1 to 5. Feedback from EMDEs highlights worries about the impact of other countries' carbon pricing mechanisms on trade, industry, and government revenues, with both financial risks and economic impacts noted across all income levels.

> Page 13 underscores the diverse concerns Ministries of Finance (MoFs) hold regarding climate change impacts on macroeconomic stability, with a distinct emphasis on the differences between emerging and developed economies. Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) express significant concern about physical and transition risks, particularly regarding government finances, GDP, and competitiveness. These concerns are quantified on a scale from one to five in a table provided, with EMDEs expressing greater apprehension overall compared to advanced economies (AEs). A significant focus is placed on financial and economic impacts from national and international climate policies, such as carbon pricing and their resultant trade implications.

> Page 14 examines how climate policies are prioritized within Finance Ministries (MoFs). Although 90% view climate action as an important economic issue, only a third see it as central to their core mandate. Many MoFs are involved in implementing climate strategies, taxes, and subsidies, yet show less engagement in investment strategies and adaptation plans. There is generally uniform engagement across advanced and developing economies, though advanced economies typically progress further in areas like green subsidies and financial integration.

> Page 15 discusses the key considerations that guide Ministries of Finance in implementing climate-related policies. High importance is given to fiscal sustainability, economic growth, and efficiency by over 80% of the respondents. While international competitiveness and distributional impacts are noted, international legal obligations like those under the UNFCCC or Paris Agreement receive lower priority. MoFs struggle with insufficient data related to climate impacts, economic outcomes, and financial planning, affecting their ability to assess risks and conduct effective policy planning. Key challenges include overcoming data uncertainties and estimating costs for clean energy transitions and infrastructure resilience, alongside improving the effectiveness of policy assessments and evaluations.

> The financial implications of decarbonization, adaptation, and diversification away from fossil fuels remain unquantified in a substantial number of countries. Almost half, or forty-four percent, of Ministries of Finance have yet to conduct any analysis to estimate public expenditure and financing needs for adaptation and resilience to climate change. Only around a quarter, or twenty-six percent, report that they have conducted such analyses. 
> 
> Substantially more Ministries of Finance, or forty-nine percent, have estimated public expenditure costs and financing needs associated with policies for decarbonization. However, most Ministries are yet to conduct sector-specific analysis, particularly around buildings, with only twenty-nine percent having completed assessments, and agriculture and land use, with thirty-five percent. Additionally, only about a third of Ministries of Finance, or thirty-nine percent, have estimated financing needs for economic diversification. This includes expenditure costs and financing needed for transitioning key sectors away from fossil fuels, such as compensation for fossil fuel industries or infrastructure, and re-skilling of the labor force in areas dependent on fossil fuels. No significant differences between advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies were observed across these three areas.
