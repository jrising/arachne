> It's quite possible, but not guaranteed. The Y-chromosome is passed down from father to son, so if the man who shares your last name is a direct paternal ancestor (e.g., your father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc., on your father's side), you likely have inherited the same Y-chromosome. However, mutations can occur over generations, leading to slight differences between your Y-chromosome and that of your ancestor. Additionally, if there have been any non-paternal events (such as adoption or name changes) in the generations between you and that ancestor, it's possible your direct paternal line has changed, affecting the Y-chromosome transmission.
