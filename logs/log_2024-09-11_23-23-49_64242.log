> There was a fantastic discussion that occurred in Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. I think it was Daniel Waterhouse who said it. The discussion was about two things that are the biggest questions of all time, and Daniel claims that the answers to them are related.  They were something like "what is god?" and "what is the medium of the universe?" but I think even less related than that.

> In Neal Stephenson's *Baroque Cycle*, especially through the character Daniel Waterhouse, there are indeed discussions that weave together philosophical, theological, and scientific ideas. The questions you're referencing might be along the lines of some of the broader inquiries that characters in the series explore, such as "What is the nature of the divine?" and "What is the fundamental substance or medium of the universe?"

> In the context of the Baroque period, these questions could relate to debates about the nature of God versus the emerging scientific understanding of reality—similar to theological inquiries juxtaposed with the development of natural philosophy (early science). Both questions reflect the era's tensions between religion and science, which remained central to Enlightenment thinkers—themes that Stephenson superbly explores.
> 
> The idea that their answers are related hints at a more unified view of existence, which Daniel Waterhouse, a character who bridges the divide between science and mysticism, might propose. He represents the transitional nature of thought in this epoch: seeking to reconcile faith with reason. I hope this helps you reconnect with that fantastic discussion! If you have more specific details, I might be able to refine my answer further.
