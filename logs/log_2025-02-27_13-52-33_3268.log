> Delaware’s coastal economy is subject to a spectrum of economic risks and opportunities. Infrastructure and assets are vulnerable to flooding and sea-level rise. Tourism, a vital sector, is subject to fluctuations due to shifting behaviors. The natural environment faces mounting threats from global and local environmental change. Alongside these challenges lie significant economic opportunities. As appreciation for beautiful environments escalates, and businesses adapt to the changing needs of an aging population, new avenues for growth will continue to emerge.
> 
> Understanding the dynamism of the coastal economy is a prerequisite for better resource allocation and maximizing economic potential. This project proposes to develop a “Coastal Barometer” of these changing economic and environmental forces, which would offer a holistic perspective on the coastal economy's health and offer deep-dives into the underlying risks and opportunities across coastal communities and sectors.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer is conceived as a transformative tool designed to capture and convey the dynamic health of the coastal economy. The Barometer would provide an extensive dashboard of regularly updated data, reflecting the coastal economy’s overall and sector-specific health. It will support strategic planning, informed land-use decisions, and accurate forecasting of developmental impacts by reporting both an overarching economic and environmental health measure and diverse supporting indicators. These indicators will cover direct and indirect economic outputs, climate and other environmental risks, and gauges of economic resilience.
> 
> The Barometer is needed because risks and opportunities often depend upon changes that occur over large spatial scales and long time scales. In light of this, the tool will (1) report the immediate state of economic health but also signals and trends that can help users understand underlying dynamics of growth and resilience; and (2) the interplay between the coastal economy and broader state and national economies.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer is more than a statistical tool; it is a pathway to deeper economic insight. By simplifying access to and communicating this vital information in a visual way, it empowers coastal community leaders to make more informed decisions and investments. The tool also enables planners to accurately anticipate the impacts of changes, aligning them with sustainable and inclusive growth objectives.
> 
> Relevance to the Delaware Sea Grant Strategic Plan and the Needs of Delawareans
> 
> The Coastal Barometer strategically aligns with Delaware Sea Grant’s objectives by providing critical data and insights that enhance resilience and support sustainable development across multiple functional work areas. In the realm of Coastal Community Resilience and Planning, it offers valuable data that enables communities and state agencies like DNREC and Delaware DOT to make informed decisions regarding climate adaptation and infrastructure planning, ensuring preparedness for environmental and economic challenges. For Economic Development, the Barometer identifies growth opportunities and risks, aiding local economic development offices and policymakers in fostering a diverse, sustainable coastal economy. It supports Healthy Coastal Ecosystems by supplying data that facilitates ecosystem restoration efforts and enables environmental organizations to monitor ecological health effectively. Additionally, the tool’s integrative approach promotes environmental literacy by equipping community leaders and educators with concrete and accessible data for planning and instruction, thereby fostering informed decision-making and enhancing public communications and understanding of interconnected economic and environmental issues.
> 
> The project emerged from previous work with the Association of Coastal Towns (ACT), leveraging $39,754 in previous funding, and with the encouragement of DESG team members in Coastal Hazards (Danielle Swallow) and Coastal Communities Development (Ed Lewandowski). In addition to DNREC and DOT, the tool would improve decision-making for City and Town Economic Development Offices and Chambers of Commerce, Sussex County, State Parks, and Local Business Owners.
> 
> The project also helps provide crucial information that Delaware’s coastal townships have expressly requested. This project builds upon a report on the economic contribution of Delaware’s coasts to the state economy and tax base. A previous report on this topic was developed with Sea Grant support in 2012 (Latham & Lewis 2012). This report was used extensively by coastal towns to argue for state-wide resources and planning. The updated information was funded directly by the coastal towns, with contributions across the ACT (Rising & Wilson 2024). However, as economic conditions continue to evolve, new information will be needed. A key set of indicators to be shared through the Coastal Barometer will be regularly updated measures of these economic contributions.
> 
> Research Activities
> 
> The project brings together quantitative methodologies drawn from (1) economic impact analysis, (2) inclusive accounting, and (3) economic assessment of climate impacts, with stakeholder co-design methodologies from the literature around (1) user-driven model design and (2) model-based scenario development. The tasks below include both innovative academic research (Tasks 1.1, 2.1 - 2.3, and 4.2), dedicated stakeholder engagement activities (Tasks 1.2 - 1.3, 3.1, and 4.1), and technical development tasks (Tasks 3.2 - 3.2, and parts of Tasks 2.3 and 4.1 - 4.2).
> 
> WP1: Stakeholder engagement
> WP1 will coordinate stakeholder workshops and the associated iterative feedback process, and ensure that a diverse stakeholder body is engaged throughout the project. A significant part of the work for developing the Coastal Barometer will be a structured engagement process, building on research approaches from Bhave et al. (2018). This engagement process is described further in the Engagement section. Several outcomes of that process, however, are important for the research activities, and in particular:
> The selection of salient indicators and development of stakeholder-relevant visualizations
> The effective communication of economic health, risk, and opportunity information
> 
> Task 1.1: Review the academic literature on stakeholder-based model co-design: While stakeholder engagement and co-design is common, and iterative model design has a long history, best practices are not readily available in cases like this where the fundamental choice of quantitative information needs to be decided. This task will produce a review publication with best practices.
> Task 1.2: Engage a broad community of stakeholders for inclusion in the workshops. This task will work with partners at Sea Grant and Atlantic coastal towns to identify potential users at multiple levels of decision-making.
> Task 1.3: Facilitate the workshops, as described under the Engagement section. Four phases of workshops are planned, with clear feedback processes and decision points.
> 
> WP2: Economic health quantification
> The construction of a holistic measure of economic health is a central research goal of the project. It is intended to capture the resilience of the economy to socioeconomic and environmental shocks and the preparedness of communities to take advantage of emerging investment opportunities. A quantification of economic health is built upon risk assessment and inclusive accounting approaches (Stiglitz et al. 2009), and must engage with the challenges of uncertainty and variability and multiple spatial and temporal scales.
> 
> WP1, WP2, and WP3 form the central iterative research loop of the project, with stakeholder feedback shaping both the quantification of economic health (WP2) and the communication of it (WP3). External indicators that will feed into this analysis, as well as stakeholder-friendly extracts of this economic health work, are described in WP3.
> 
> Task 2.1: Improvements in regional economic contributions: Based on the experience from Rising & Wilson (2024), standard practices in the assessment of economic contributions are ripe for improvement. This task will formalize insights on (1) the use of value added measures, (2) the connection between industry contribution analysis and region contribution analysis, and (3) the use of historical estimates to capture changes in economic contributions. These improvements were described in Rising & Wilson (2024), but here will be positioned within the economic literature and published.
> 
> Task 2.2: Coastal economic health: Using Monte Carlo methods, the state of the coastal economy will be projected under the variability in external economic and environmental conditions. This correlated risk accounting approach will provide a quantification of coastal resilience and the economies response to known risks and opportunities. To represent the economies preparedness to unknown risks and opportunities, we will draw on the work of Harvard’s Growth Lab and the Atlas of Economic Complexity (Hausmann et al. 2014), by constructing and analyzing the network structure of economic activity in the coastal region.
> 
> Task 2.3: Methods for public data updating: Performing regional contribution analysis, as done in Rising & Wilson (2024), generally requires an advanced multi-region input-output (MRIO) model. Rising & Wilson (2024) used the IMPLAN model. For the Coastal Barometer, however, the IMPLAN model is too expensive and it cannot be used for regular automatic updating. This task will develop a set of methods already partially validated under the Rising & Wilson work (Rising 2024), which use publicly available government datasets (which also form the basis of the IMPLAN model) to update the full set of contribution analysis results. The task will study the effectiveness and limitations of the method.
> 
> WP3: Online framework development
> The key underlying features needed for the online Coastal Barometer tool are that it be (1) continuously updating with minimal human intervention, and (2) easily expandable and customizable as conditions and stakeholder needs evolve. This task is largely technical, aimed at building a system using R Shiny (Sievert 2020). A design contractor will be engaged to work on the user experience of the site, and a research engineer will support the development, focusing on the reliability of the updating and the responsiveness of the site.
> 
> Task 3.1: Indicator development: Indicators will reflect stakeholder interests across multiple sectors. This task will develop both initial versions of the indicators, to share with stakeholders, and final versions for the online tool. Some possible indicators include economic measures such as a real estate Months Supply of Inventory (MSI), measuring a buyers vs. sellers market; a business attraction/retention index; the Regional Attractiveness Index, from the OECD; risk and environmental measures such as insurance premiums; coastal and inland flooding risk indicators; and the Tourist Climate Index (TCI).
> 
> Task 3.2: User-facing development: The user-facing side of the website should provide intuitive opportunities to dig down beyond composite indices, and show spatial and sectoral heterogeneity. This task will develop multiple versions of this to vet with stakeholders.
> This work will be informed by existing tools in nationally and in the EU with similar goals:
> European Environment Agency
> Adaptation Dashboard
> Environmental Defence Fund
> U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index
> 
> Features: Simple/accessible measures; ability to view measures for each evaluated city/region.
> 
> Features: Measures defined hierarchically; pairing spatial heterogeneity with simple indices; close connection with underlying data.
> 
> 
> Task 3.3: Internal-facing development: Another section of the website will be for internal managers, offering ways to track usage, manage updating processes, add new indicators and remove others, update the site template (CSS), and turn on or off features, such as the WP4 AI tool. This task will develop this system in coordination with Delaware Sea Grant. We plan to confirm a long-term home for the tool (potentially DESG) before the full proposal phase.
> 
> WP4: AI Integration
> This project offers a good case study to study a key missing link between modern chat-based artificial intelligence tools (GPT) and quantitative data. GPT are notoriously poor at providing quantitative information, although Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can address this in some cases. WP4 will use a suite of AI tools developed by the PI to improve the user experience of the tool while evaluating options to better connect GPT and quantitative data.
> 
> Task 4.1: Provide a chat interface to online tool: The PI has already produced multiple chat interfaces to GPT tools for teaching, and will apply the technique here. The primary “goal” of the AI under Task 4.1 will be for navigation and explanation, with interactions aimed at providing users with information about the indicators and their uses, and to direct them to appropriate parts of the site.
> 
> Task 4.2: Develop a scenario storytelling system: This will extend the AI interface from task 4.1 with a storytelling mode, which will translate quantitative information into accessible scenarios for stakeholders. The AI will be trained to put quantitative risks and opportunities into words, to help users understand them.
> 
> Engagement
> 
> Stakeholders will be engaged in a series of workshops, which aim to (1) solicit their objectives in using the Coastal Barometer and their economic concerns; (2) co-design indicators, visualizations, and user experiences that make results accessible and salient; and (3) provide a platform for outreach of the tool to broader audiences. The management of this process will occur under WP1 and target the range of stakeholders listed in the “Relevance to the DESG Strategic Plan” section. The project will partner with DESG in this engagement process.
> 
> In addition to local officials and other non-technical stakeholders, the project will form a technical advisory group drawn from the stakeholder institutions. The technical advisory group will participate in workshops as stakeholders, but they will also provide feedback on indicator development between workshops.
> 
> The workshops will take place in four stages. Each stage will either involve multiple workshops or a single workshop with breakout groups, depending on the need for consensus-building. Some workshops will be online and some in person, based on convenience and the goals of the workshop.
> 
> Phase 1: Introduction to the Coastal Barometer project: These workshops would aim to get feedback on the broad goals of the project and initiate the co-design process.
> Phase 2: Indicator development: These workshops will share mock-ups of the online tool, informed by Phase 1, and discuss indicators as they are developed (also introduced in Phase 1).
> Phase 3: Initial tool interaction: These workshops would invite stakeholders to interact with the tool, offer feedback on the indicators, and help stakeholders understand their use cases.
> Phase 4: Final version and outreach: The final phase will take the completed tool back to stakeholders, and hold further discussions on the impact of the tool and future needs, as well as ask stakeholders to interact with the AI component.
> 
> Extension
> 
> The central goal of the Coastal Barometer is extension, placing new scientific information into the hands of stakeholders. This is a direct continuation of the Latham & Lewis (2012) Sea Grant study, allowing this kind of economic information to have greater impact. The main outlet for the research findings will be the online tool (the Coastal Barometer), and Phase 4 of the stakeholder engagement process. In addition, Task 1.1 will result in a publication on stakeholder engagement best practices and an academic publication from Tasks 2.2 and 3.1 will offer some stakeholders with improved insight into the state and future potential of public-facing indicators.
> 
> The tool will also be shared through networks that Sea Grant participates in, including SEDAC and RASCL, along with best-practices and insights related to its use. It can also be shared at the annual conference of the Delmarva Alliance of Adaptation Professionals and the Social Coast conference.
