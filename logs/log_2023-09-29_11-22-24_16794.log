**user**:
> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. I have a section on artificial reefs. The artificial reefs are mainly in the bay, but with some projects in deeper waters. Here are additional details on the datasets:
> 
> Delaware has 14 permitted artificial reef sites in Delaware Bay and along the Atlantic Coast. Cleaned and stable construction materials, boats, and subway cars create new habitat. They support expanded recreational fishing and diving.
> Artificial reef programs site, manage and develop reefs, but also have the responsibility to communicate the locations of reef material placements to anglers in order to facilitate enhanced fishing opportunities, one of the major goals of the effort. Because angler and boater funds (excise taxes) are primarily used for reef development, it is important to communicate this information to anglers and it is part of the federal aid project.
> 
> 
> The map included in the section shows Reef Site Locations, Rock Deployment, High Points, Reef Guide Locations, and Other Artificial Reefs. Here is information about each of those datasets:
> 
> Rock deployments:
> 
> Delaware Bay Sites 4, 6 and 7 received rock deployments. The numbered blue circles, on the maps in the guide, are the rock deployment targets. 
> 
> High Points (these are completely covered by the rock deployments points):
> 
> Delaware Bay Sites 4, 6 and 7 received rock deployments. For many targets, there is a numbered set of coordinates for the highest point of the rock pile, red diamonds on the maps in the guide.
> 
> Reef guide locations:
> Reef guide points are an assortment of products.  Concrete is the most common and is deployed as pieces or culverts.  Concrete is arranged as mounds with a high point, in a circular patter or in a line as drag drops.  Rock is deployed in a similar fashion as concrete.  Ballasted tires and marine cable are deployed as single point.  Other products used are armored military vehicles, subway cars and salvaged vessels.  Vessels include tugs, barges, ferries and decommissioned military vessels.
>

> 
> Other artificial reefs:
> Artificial reefs provide new or enhanced hardbottom habitat to areas that may or may not be habitat limited. Artificial habitat provides space that is quickly colonized by sessile organisms and provides new food sources, greater protection of juveniles by providing more space to be used as refuge, and a possible focal point for aggregating adults to spawn. These data were obtained using a variety of methods, including downloading data from state websites, getting data directly from state and NOAA contacts, and conducting internet research.

> Can you represent this information in a paragraph for the report?
**assistant**:
> Delaware actively supports 14 sanctioned artificial reef sites within its bays and the Atlantic coast. As a part of an expansive state initiative to bolster bionetworks and facilitate recreational activities, these artificial reefs are established using environmentally safe, sanitized construction materials, decommissioned vessels
