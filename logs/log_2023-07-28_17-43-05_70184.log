> I plan to propose a perspectives piece, to be jointly published by Nature and the Journal of Economic Perspectives, reflecting the work of a recent workshop. Below are the first several pages of the workshop report:
> ---
> Introduction
> 
> Enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration between physical scientists, economists, and other social scientists can overcome the long-term disconnect that has existed between these disciplines in the context of climate change.  This disconnect is, amongst other causes, responsible for the serious problems with the understanding in economics of the relationship between estimates of the economic impacts of climate change and the underlying science.
> 
> The findings of physical climate science over recent decades have generated a deeper understanding of the very serious risks to human societies and ecosystems from current and future climate change. This has underpinned calls for strong mitigation and adaptation action. For example, the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that “Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health (very high confidence). There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all (very high confidence).”  It also states: “Deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade would reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems (very high confidence), and deliver many co-benefits, especially for air quality and health (high confidence)”1. The findings of physical climate science underpin the aim of Article 2a of the Paris Agreement: “Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2ÅãC above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5ÅãC above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”2.
> 
> Economists also have sought to understand and assess the consequences of current and future climate change. Some have developed economic models to attempt to describe potential changes in the economy, natural environment, and/or other social systems resulting from climate change, and to understand decisions and choices. Economists use models and other methods and tools to estimate the economic impacts of climate change, due to, for example, increased temperatures and extreme events. Economic assessments underpin governmental and private sector policies, finance, and strategic decisions. It is therefore critical that economic assessments reflect as well as possible current and future climate change, to inform decisions about mitigation and adaptation.
> 
> However, many economic assessments do not adequately reflect the scientific evidence of current and future climate change, for many reasons which are explained in this report. As a consequence, economic assessments can often lead to misleading portrayals of the possible consequences of climate change.
> 
> The problems with current assessments of the economic impacts of climate change were highlighted by the contribution of Working Group II to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, which pointed out: “Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages generally increase non-linearly with global warming levels (high confidence). The wide range of global estimates, and the lack of comparability between methodologies, does not allow for identification of a robust range of estimates (high confidence)”3.
> 
> While many in the economics profession, whether or not they are working with models, recognise these problems, and are working on improvements, serious issues remain; there is not yet a satisfactory mechanism for guiding future research efforts in this area.
> 
> This report summarises the key findings from a two-day discussion meeting held at the Royal Society in March 2023 under the lead of Lord Nicholas Stern FRS. The purpose of this discussion meeting was to bring together physical scientists, economists, and other social scientists to explore how to collectively increase the understanding of economic consequences of climate change. In doing so, this could inform economic policy and drive the action required to implement the Paris Agreement, to create a path of sustainable and resilient development.
> 
> The report begins with sharing the key messages and research priorities that have emerged from the discussion meeting. It then summarises the findings of each themespecific session in further detail. The meeting was attended by leading experts from across the world from economics and the physical, social and health sciences. The names of contributors to this report and participants of the discussion meeting can be found in Appendices A and B, respectively.  The agenda of the meeting can be found in Appendix C.  The report is a reflection of the presentations and discussions held during the event. The content within this report does not reflect the position of the Royal Society.
> 
> Key messages
> 
> Enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration between economists and physical scientists, responding to information needs of decision-makers
> 
> Most current approaches to economic assessments of impacts of climate change do not reflect the severity of consequences that are suggested by the latest physical climate science and evidence on impacts, due to a disconnect between the economics and physical sciences disciplines.
> 
> Key aspects of the physical impacts of climate change are missing from many current economic assessments, including for example the full consequences of extreme weather events and the potential for cascading risks and tipping points. Interdisciplinary collaboration between physical scientists, economists and other relevant disciplines could help to better integrate the latest physical science into economic assessments, analytical approaches, and models, by sharing scientific evidence in formats that are more tailored to the needs of economists.
> 
> This dialogue needs to be two-way and address fundamental gaps in methods, for example with scientists and economists working together to develop new approaches to assessments. Working directly with decisionmakers during the process of developing new approaches would further ensure their outputs address the information needs of decision-makers.
> 
> Disaggregating data and integrating local information in economic assessments
> 
> Approaches to assessing the economic impacts of climate change often use spatially aggregated data. As impacts are often non-linear, aggregation over large spatial or temporal domains may overlook severe local impacts. By integrating more local data in their assessments, economists could produce estimates of the economic and social consequences of climate change that are more locationand context-specific and useful for decision-makers at a range of scales.
> 
> In addition, as a lot of paradigms that underpin this type of economic assessment may not be as well or widely accepted in the Global South scholarship, collaboration between economists and scientists from the Global North and the Global South could yield a better understanding of what information needs to be included to provide robust estimates of economic impacts of climate change for the Global South.
> 
> Integrating nature and health into economic assessments
> 
> Climate change, human health, and nature are all fundamentally interlinked. Loss of natural capital can be a significant risk multiplier for climate change impacts.  However, these aspects are often missing from economic assessments of impacts of climate change. Economists could work collaboratively with natural, health and social scientists to better integrate data on nature and human health into economic assessments.
> 
> This would allow economists to emphasise the importance of inclusive wealth, and the role of four types of capital — physical, human, natural and social — in their assessments of the political economic impacts of climate change. Such an approach would help to represent the full spectrum of economic implications of climate change and better capture potential amplifying feedbacks. This approach could also highlight the potential co-benefits of climate action for nature and human health, compared to narrower metrics such as gross domestic product.
> 
> Increasing the focus on adaptation and development in the economic analysis of climate change
> 
> Greater attention should be paid to adaptation when assessing the economic implications of climate change, particularly at the local level. Crucially, adaptation must be considered together with economic development, as well as mitigation, as they are fundamentally interlinked.  At present, adaptation is frequently underrepresented, or even omitted, in approaches to economic analyses of climate change. There is limited understanding of the quantified damages and risks to be adapted to and the benefits and costs of adaptation.
> 
> Adaptation has received insufficient attention in policy and investment decisions, despite the potential for adaptation to greatly reduce the risks of climate change and support development goals. Better accounting of adaptation in economic assessments of impacts of climate change could help to inform policy decisions for resource allocation, drive practical adaptation action, and identify co-benefits for development.
> 
> Incorporating ethics, inequality and justice in the economic analysis of climate change
> 
> Many, or most, economic assessments of climate change adopt an approach based on standard welfare economics.  As such, they do not take explicit account of the rights and obligations of current and future generations. Justice is in large measure about the respecting of rights. For example, many assessments focus on the consequences of climate change on overall or aggregated human welfare and discount the welfare and experiences of future generations using discount rates which have little basis in ethics, and which are inadequate in their treatment of potentially very bad outcomes. The treatment of discounting is often cavalier for these reasons. Many economists are increasingly uncomfortable with the way and degree to which the future is discounted and its consequences for policy, within the standard welfare approaches.
> 
> Further, there are alternative ethical frameworks and moral philosophies that would re-shape climate change economics and drive discussions about, for example, what a virtuous society would do, or how to ensure that particular human rights are respected. Assessments could integrate non-welfarist approaches that value, for example, knowledge, culture and nature. Inequality across and within countries could be better taken into account such that country-specific efforts to mitigate emissions are reconciled with ethical arguments in the context of a just transition.
> 
> Taking a storyline approach to communicate uncertainty
> 
> Physical sciences and economics often address uncertainty by presenting a likely range of estimates. However, this can underplay the policy relevance of low-likelihood, or unknown likelihood, high-impact outcomes. This means policymakers may not be aware of possible outcomes outside of the indicated likely range of estimates, potentially leading to under-preparedness for more extreme scenarios.
> 
> One alternative approach could be the use of storylines, which use conditional ‘if-then’ statements to show a range of plausible outcomes, including low-likelihood, or unknown likelihood, high-impact scenarios. A storyline approach to communicating the risks of climate change could help policymakers to better prepare policies and actions which take account of the full range of possible scenarios.
> 
> Assessing economic impacts of climate change in a future context
> 
> The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole — and the present state of many aspects of the climate system — are unprecedented over many centuries to many millions of years. Economic assessments of climate change are often based solely on observed past data and rely on unrealistic extrapolation for estimating future economic impacts of climate change. This results in a failure to consider outcomes that might occur under unprecedented levels of global warming. For example, projecting existing or past relationships of climate variability and migration may be less valid as variables that drive migration, including demographics and migration policies, are likely to change, possibly dramatically.
> 
> Economists could explore a diversity of approaches and tools to assessing the economic impacts of climate change, such as process-based models and artificial intelligence, and adopt a ‘storylines’ approach to better consider an uncertain future potentially way outside previous human experience.
> 
> Research priorities
> 
> Addressing the following research priorities would contribute to improving economic assessments of the impacts of climate change. Improved estimates would help to better inform strategic decisions for enhanced climate action.
> 
> Integrating extreme events and other climate-induced hazards into economic assessments
> 
> Further research is required to understand how to better integrate extreme events and climate-induced hazards into economic analysis of climate change. Understanding how to integrate data on frequently excluded hazard categories, such as wildfires and flooding, may help to create more robust economic assessments of climate change. That could, for example, improve specification and discussion of damage functions in integrated assessment models (IAMs). However, the contribution of IAMs is limited in many important ways.
> 
> Even more importantly, integrating extreme events and other climate-induced hazards could contribute to further research into novel approaches, perspectives and frameworks of models that could lead to a better understanding of the economic implications of extreme events and climate-induced hazards. Further work is also required to capture the cascading global implications of climate change, such as the impacts of changing patterns of droughts on global food prices (both levels and stability), and the non-linear compounding effects of physical climate shocks with other shocks and stresses that can significantly amplify impacts.
> 
> Understanding the impacts of Earth system tipping points and non-linear processes, and integrating these into economic assessments
> 
> Further work is needed to better understand the potential physical impacts of almost all global Earth system tipping points; only the impacts of the possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and accelerated sea-level rise from loss of ice from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets have received much attention.  Further physical science research is also needed to better understand regional and local tipping points, which are even less understood than global climate tipping points, and the links between ecological regime change and tipping points. Understanding tipping points and nonlinear processes and integrating these into economic assessments of climate change may require international cross-disciplinary collaboration and a range of approaches to empirical data collection and modelling. It is of the utmost importance as the risk of encountering tipping points seems to grow ever higher.
> 
> Accounting for adaptation in economic assessments of climate change
> 
> Adaptation is currently underrepresented in approaches to economic analysis of climate change. Analytical empirical analysis and model-based research is required to better understand the economic implications of existing and future planned adaptation responses to climate change.  This could help to inform global stocktakes of adaptation that are undertaken for the Paris Agreement. As adaptation is often a local, autonomous response, this will require research at local scales, particularly in areas of the Global South vulnerable or exposed to climate change. But consideration must also be given to adaptation needs at the national, regional and global scale, given the threats to global systems – including food, nature, water and energy – from climate change.
> 
> Furthermore, research is required to better understand climate change adaptation and its relationship with economic development, how to represent this in economic assessments of climate change, and how to communicate this to decision-makers to inform practical adaptation and development efforts. This work will also help understand ‘loss and damage’ and the limits to adaptation. Disasters and loss and damage are playing an ever-increasing role in international discussion, including of debt, and such discussion needs to be better informed of the scale and nature of risks.
> 
> Understanding the economic implications of climate change impacts on population displacement and migration
> 
> Climate change is expected to affect the availability of resources and the liveability of many regions. A key research need is to understand to what extent these changing conditions will influence population displacement and migration flows in the future, and subsequent economic implications within and between different countries. Furthermore, assessments that estimate the economic impacts of climate change should integrate data on population displacement and migration. Current assessments do not tend to do this, or only in a very limited way, which can lead to an incomplete picture of the real economic impacts in regions affected by population displacement and migration. There is also a need to better understand the monetary costs of involuntary displacement of people, both temporarily and permanently, due to changes in extreme climate and weather events. Finally, further research is required to better represent population displacement and migration in novel economic assessment approaches, including future socioeconomic drivers which have not happened in the past.
> 
> All of the above face the crucial methodological challenges of how to look out for and analyse circumstances and potential events which can be way outside human experience. And they involve potentially immense systemic events and instabilities, as well as local existential events. These methodological challenges should be examined directly. All too often the economists’ natural and understandable predilection for data-driven analysis leads to attempts to extrapolate past statistical associations to circumstances way outside the range of past experience.

> Title: **Bridging the Disconnect: A Joint Perspective on Economic and Physical Sciences in Addressing Climate Change**
> 
> Dear Editors,
> 
> I am writing to propose a joint perspective article for _Nature_ and the _Journal of Economic Perspectives_ that will provide solutions to bridge the long-standing disconnect between economic and physical sciences in the context of climate change. Based on a recent two-day workshop held at the Royal Society, the proposed perspective will discuss key findings, research priorities, and methods to better align the two disciplines in addressing the escalating climate crisis.
> 
> This proposal is borne out of recognition of the vital role that interdisciplinary collaboration plays in understanding and combating climate change. The scientific evidence for the severity of climate change is underrepresented within economic models, resulting in the underestimation of its potential repercussions and inadequate policymaking.
> 
> The proposed perspective article will explore the following thematic areas:
> 
> 1. **Enhanced Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Discussing the necessity of interdisciplinary discourse in integrating the latest physical science into economic assessments.
> 
> 2. **Disaggregating Data and Integrating Local Information**: Emphasizing the need for context-specific, localized data in economic assessments for accurate representation of regional climate change impacts.
> 
> 3. **Integrating Nature and Health into Economic Assessments**: Advocating for an inclusive approach that incorporates natural, health and social aspects of climate change within economic assessments.
> 
> 4. **Increasing focus on Adaptation and Development**: Highlighting the essential role of adaptation in economic analysis and policy-making to reduce the risks of climate change and support development goals.
> 
> 5. **Incorporating Ethics, Inequality, and Justice**: Urging economic analysis to consider ethical dimensions in terms of obligations towards current and future generations and issues of global justice.
> 
> 6. **Communicating Uncertainty through Storylines**: Suggesting novel approaches to communicating the potential range of climate impacts, addressing uncertainty in a manner relevant to policy-making.
> 
> 7. **Assessing Future Impacts**: Advocating for a range of models that take into account future, unprecedented levels of global warming.
> 
> 8. **Research Priorities**: Highlighting the need for continued research in incorporating extreme events into economic assessments, addressing Earth system tipping points and non-linear processes, accounting for adaptation, understanding climate change-induced migration, and more.
> 
> The need for an integrated approach in dealing with climate change is perhaps more crucial than ever. This piece will make a significant contribution by addressing the gaps in our current understanding and offering actionable insights. As experienced scholars in modeling and with a keen interest in global sustainability, we assure you that our proposed perspective will be a vital resource for researchers, policy makers, and readers across sectors.
> 
> We look forward to the opportunity to further discuss our proposal and its potential contributions to the readership of both your esteemed journals.
