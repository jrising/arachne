>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
>  
> 
> My name is Joe Gentine and I am a masters student at the Ohio State University graduating this December. 
> 
>  
> 
> I recently came across your research and was genuinely excited by it. I would like to gain experience understanding similar questions and am wondering whether you are planning to hire research assistants in the next year? 
> 
>  
> 
> My undergraduate degree is from Notre Dame with a double major in Environmental Sciences and Economics. While my masters is in Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology. Specifically, my thesis explores how streams in agricultural watersheds influence water quality (fertilizer concentrations) and I have a range of experiences working in freshwater ecosystems. Through these experiences I have gained technical skills in statistics and coding, and a deep understanding of how ecosystems work.
> 
>  
> 
> I have always been captivated by the functioning of the natural world but over the past few years I have found myself wanting to use my economics degree more in my work. Your research program excites me because your research seems to cross lines between natural and economic systems. If you are willing to consider me or know of similar research programs I should consider I would love to know. My CV is attached below.

**assistant**:
> Here are the specific points from Joe Gentine's email:
> 
> - Joe is expressing interest in gaining experience similar to your research and is asking if you plan to hire research assistants in the next year.
> - Joe has a background in Environmental Sciences and Economics from Notre Dame and is completing a master's in Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology at Ohio State University.
> - He has thesis experience with streams in agricultural watersheds, focusing on water quality and fertilizers, along with skills in statistics and coding.
> - Joe is interested in working more with economics, coupled with his fascination with natural systems and his excitement about your interdisciplinary research.
> 
> Joe's email does not explicitly mention a specific program, but his interests and background align with programs involving economics and natural systems. Given his current focus and your own research areas, he might naturally gravitate towards the Masters or Ph.D. in Environmental Economics or perhaps the Environmental Science & Management program with its Marine track.
> 
> Since Joe's email doesn't seem to indicate any specific geographic connection to Delaware or the previously mentioned institutions, no special notes there.
> 
> Here's a draft response for Joe:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Joe,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in my research program. Your background in Environmental Sciences and Economics, along with your work in freshwater ecosystems, aligns well with the interdisciplinary focus we strive for.
> 
> To help guide prospective students like yourself toward the most suitable academic programs, we're now using a form that helps identify key interests and program fit. Could you please fill out the form linked below?
> 
> https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7
> 
> This will help us determine the best path forward for you, whether it is in one of our specific programs or through opportunities like research assistantships.
