Here, I review, synthesize, and interpret recent advances in methods used to measure effects of climate on social and economic outcomes. Because weather variation plays a large role in recent progress, I formalize the relationship between climate and weather from an econometric perspective and discuss the use of these two factors as identifying variation, highlighting trade-offs between key assumptions in different research designs and deriving conditions when weather variation exactly identifies the effects of climate. I then describe recent advances, such as the parameterization of climate variables from a social perspective, use of nonlinear models with spatial and temporal displacement, characterization of uncertainty, measurement of adaptation, cross-study comparison, and use of empirical estimates to project the impact of future climate change. I conclude by discussing remaining methodological challenges.</p> </div></div><!--/abstract content--><div class="hlFld-KeywordText"><h2 id="_i1"><span>Keywords</span></h2><p><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author">  <a class="attributes" href="/keyword/Climate+Change">climate change</a>,  <a class="attributes" href="/keyword/Weather">weather</a>,  <a class="attributes" href="/keyword/Disasters">disasters</a>,  <a class="attributes" href="/keyword/Causal+Inference">causal inference</a></kwd-group></p></div><!--fulltext content--><div class="hlFld-Fulltext"><h2 id="_i2"><span>1. INTRODUCTION</span></h2> <p>How does the climate affect society and the economy? This question has challenged thinkers for centuries, and the answer promises insight into why economies developed differently historically, how modern society can best respond to current climatic events, and how future climate changes may impact humanity. In recent years, numerous econometric analyses have emerged to address this question by studying the effects of specific climatic conditions on different social and economic outcomes. The recency of this research activity is explained primarily by methodological advances that, combined with increasing access to computing power and climate data, catalyzed progress.</p> <p>The goal of this review is to collect and synthesize these advances. In particular, I highlight core innovations and explain linkages between different methods. I also attempt to tackle an issue that has proved particularly thorny: the debate as to whether regressions on “weather” variables provide meaningful insight into the effects of climate. By formalizing this question, I can derive conditions under which the use of weather variables in regressions is justified and, perhaps surprisingly, dominates traditionally preferred methods. In the latter portion of this review, I discuss how these new econometric results are being used to understand other scientific or policy questions, such as the optimal design of climate change policy. Throughout, I draw attention to methodological challenges that remain unsolved.</p> <p>This review focuses on methodology, so I will not describe data or results that are not examples of methodological innovations.

Define <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> to be the climate at <i>i</i> during <i>τ</i>, as it characterizes the distribution of possible realized states <b>v</b><sub><i>it</i></sub>.</p> <p>For each period <i>τ</i>, there is an empirical distribution ψ(<b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub>) that characterizes the distribution of states <b>v</b><sub><i>i</i>,<i>t</i>∈τ</sub> that are actually realized. In many contexts, some of the <i>K</i> parameters in <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> have analogs to fitted values for a model where the distribution is constrained to the ψ(.) family, but such an analogy is imperfect because <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> are actual measurements, not estimates.<a href="#fn1" class="ar-modal-link" title="Footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> Note that <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> and <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> are vectors of the same length with analogous elements, but they are not the same. <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> characterizes the expected distribution of <b>v</b><sub><i>it</i></sub>, whereas <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> characterizes the realized distribution of <b>v</b><sub><i>i</i>,<i>t</i>∈τ</sub>. Thus, we define <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> to be a description of the weather during <i>τ</i>.</p> <p>Examples help clarify how these definitions of climate and weather differ. Consider that the weather measures <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> might contain the sample mean and sample standard deviation of daily rainfall during a month, whereas the corresponding <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> would contain the true population mean and true population standard deviation of rainfall that could occur during that period. In another example, <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> could contain the maximum sustained wind gust speed actually experienced during a 24-h interval, whereas <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> contains the maximum of the true theoretical gust distribution for that day. Finally, <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> could contain the count of realized days with average temperatures below freezing or above 30°C in a year, whereas <b>C</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> might then contain the expected number of days in these categories.</p> <p>For notational simplicity, define <b>c</b>(<b>C</b>) as a realization of weather characteristics <b>c</b> conditional on climate characteristics <b>C</b>.</p> <p>Two questions immediately emerge for an applied econometrician. First, how should the joint distribution ψ(<b>C</b>) for the high dimensional vector <b>v</b> be summarized? Are we concerned only with average values and variances or also with some other summary statistics, such as time beyond a critical value (e.g., extreme heat days) or events that involve multiple dimensions of <b>v</b> (e.g., wind and rain simultaneously)? Unfortunately, at present, no exhaustive list of summary statistics or dimensions of <b>v</b> fully describes all socially and economically relevant parameters. In practice, different researchers have explored whether and how different summary measures <b>c</b> matter by examining one or a few at a time; for example, they examine average temperatures when controlling for average rainfall, but these should be understood as rough characterizations of a more highly structured multidimensional distribution. As current research progresses, the set of known relevant summary parameters generally tends to grow.</p> <p>Second, how long of a time interval <i>τ</i> should be considered? Historically, climate was sometimes defined as an average over 30 years (<a href="#" class="scrollRef B88 tooltip" refid="B88" id="XR13" title="  Pachauri  RK, Allen  M, Barros  V, Broome  J, Cramer  W,  et al.  2014.  Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report. Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Bremerhaven, Ger.:  Alfred-Wegener-Inst.">Pachauri et al. 2014</a>), but this definition is fairly arbitrary. In reality, there exists a well-defined expected distribution of states that might occur even for very short periods of time. For example, at every location there is an expected distribution of temperatures that might occur for each 5-min interval on each day of the year. Furthermore, this distribution might change between consecutive years, for example, due to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This suggests that climate need not have a fundamental timescale and econometricians may, in principle, study periods of varying lengths of time.</p> <h3 class="subhead">1.2. Influence of Climate Through Events and Information</h3> <p>The climate affects social outcomes in two ways. First, the climate during <i>τ</i> influences what realizations of weather <b>c</b> actually occur during that interval, which in turn affects a population directly (e.g., a rainy climate generates rain, causing people to get wet); call this the direct effect of climate. Second, individuals' beliefs over the structure of <b>C</b> may affect their decisions and resulting outcomes, regardless of what <b>c</b> is realized (e.g., if people believe their climate is rainy, some will buy umbrellas); refer to this as the belief effect. Denote all actions resulting from beliefs as the vector <b>b</b> of length <i>N</i>, indexed by <i>n</i>. We can then write that an outcome is affected by the climate because the climate affects what weather is realized and what actions individuals take based on their beliefs about the climate:</p> <p><div class="equation"><div class="label">3</div><a href="#eq-m3" class="ar-modal-link"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-004.gif" alt="equation 3" /></a></div></p> <p>Therefore, the total marginal effect of the climate on outcome <i>Y</i> is characterized by the <i>K</i>-element vector of derivatives</p> <p><div class="equation"><div class="label">4</div><a href="#eq-m4" class="ar-modal-link"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-005.gif" alt="equation 4" /></a></div></p> <p>where ∇<sub><b>c</b></sub> and ∇<sub><b>b</b></sub> are defined as gradients in the subspaces of <b>c</b> and <b>b</b>, respectively.<a href="#fn2" class="ar-modal-link" title="Footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> Observe that <span class="equationTd inline-formula"><span class="NLM_inline-graphic"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-006.gif" alt="" /></span></span><span class="formulaLabel"></span> and <span class="equationTd inline-formula"><span class="NLM_inline-graphic"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-007.gif" alt="" /></span></span><span class="formulaLabel"></span> are <i>K</i>×<i>K</i> and <i>N</i>×<i>K</i> Jacobians.<a href="#fn3" class="ar-modal-link" title="Footnote"><sup>3</sup></a></p> <p>Note that all partial derivatives are evaluated “locally” at the current climate <b>C</b>.

It is widely assumed that agents facing events <b>v</b><sub><i>it</i></sub> for long τ will update their beliefs over <b>c</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub>, whereas agents experiencing events during a short period—perhaps only for a 5-min period—will not alter their beliefs over <b>c</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> for that interval. Thus, individuals might experience the direct effects of climatic events during short τ, but they may be unlikely to alter their beliefs about the climate they face because of a short-lived event.</p> <p>Because of this logic, it is widely thought that low-frequency data (long <span class="equationTd inline-formula"><span class="NLM_inline-graphic"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-028.gif" alt="" /></span></span><span class="formulaLabel"></span> for regularly spaced data) are required to measure belief effects when using time-series variation, as populations only adjust their beliefs if environmental changes are persistent.

For example, populations separated by multiple centuries might not be comparable units.</p> <p>The tension between credible identification and use of low-frequency climate variation is not easily resolved if populations do not update their beliefs about the climate more quickly than these populations naturally change in other fundamental ways. For cases in which belief effects are large relative to direct effects, then the frequency-identification trade-off may represent a major challenge to credible identification of the total effect of the climate. Importantly, however, if the primary way in which belief effects manifest is to alter the direct effects of the climate—i.e., belief effects are mostly adaptations designed to cope with direct effects—then the total effects of climate still may be nearly identified with high-frequency time series. Even when this condition is not satisfied, exact identification may still be possible, as shown in Section 2.4.</p> <h3 class="subhead">2.3. A Partial Test of Marginal Treatment Comparability</h3> <p>Unit homogeneity assumptions can be weakened but never tested or eliminated entirely, a fundamental limitation in causal inference generally.

It is possible that cross-section, time-series, long-difference, and filtered data all provide similar parameter estimates for <i>β</i> by chance, such that the above test of marginal treatment comparability paints a misleadingly consistent picture of climate effects and weather effects that are not related. Such critiques, relying on heuristic arguments, are common in the literature. Nonetheless, there is actual theoretical justification for the marginal treatment comparability assumption. In this section I provide a new derivation demonstrating how, under certain conditions, the total effect of climate can be exactly recovered using <span class="equationTd inline-formula"><span class="NLM_inline-graphic"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-039.gif" alt="" /></span></span><span class="formulaLabel"></span> derived from weather variation. In essence, this result is a combined application of two well-known results, the Envelope Theorem and the Gradient Theorem.</p> <p>The intuition of the result is as follows. Imagine there are two otherwise identical households that are next-door neighbors on a street that runs north–south. The more northern household faces a very slightly different climate because it is very slightly further north. The difference in climate faced by the two households is vanishingly small, but nonzero. These two households have the ability to adapt many dimensions of their daily life to their beliefs about their respective climates, and they will adopt slightly different behaviors and investments that maximize various outcomes, generating belief effects. However, if we focus on outcomes that are maximized by the households, then the overall net effect caused by these slightly different adaptation decisions is zero because any marginal benefits that the northern household reaps are exactly offset by additional marginal costs (which is known because the household is at a maximum). Therefore, any difference in the optimized outcome between the two households must come from the direct effects of the slightly different climate, and the influence of slightly different beliefs and adaptations between the two households can be ignored. If a weather realization occurs such that the southern household experiences conditions that are slightly different from what they expect, and its distribution of weather actually matches the climate of the northern household, then this weather effect on the optimized outcome of the southern household must be exactly the same as the cross-sectional difference across the two households in a year when their weather realizations match their respective climates perfectly. This is because in both cases, there is no influence of changing beliefs on the optimized outcome. Stated simply, the marginal effect of the climate on an optimized outcome is exactly the same as the marginal effect of the weather.</p> <p>Based on this insight, we can trace out a curve describing climate effects between sequential neighbors by watching how optimized outcomes in each household change when that household is confronted by a weather distribution that matches the climate of their immediate next-door neighbor. The integral of these marginal differences between sequential neighbors must then describe how the climate generates larger differences between households that are not adjacent neighbors and how they experience climates that differ by a nonmarginal amount. Importantly, this integration procedure does not assume that individuals do not adjust their beliefs and adapt to their climate. Rather, the marginal effect of such adjustments for marginal climate changes is zero on an optimized outcome, so marginal effects of weather—which do not cause beliefs to change—can be used as a substitute for marginal climate changes in the integration, despite the presence of changing beliefs and adaptations.</p> <p>To see this result formally, consider an outcome of interest <i>Y</i> that may be affected by the climate <b>C</b> through its effect on weather realizations <b>c</b> and actions <b>b</b> and which is optimized so it can be written as a value function, i.e., the solution to a maximization problem over an outcome-generating function <i>z</i>(<b>b</b>, <b>c</b>).

Early analyses concerned only with measuring whether climatic factors had a nonzero effect, or the sign of an effect, used simple measures of climate such as latitude or a single indicator variable that is one if a population is exposed to a predefined event (e.g., a drought) and is zero otherwise. This approach is internally valid but has important limitations that are often underappreciated in the literature. First, coarse climate measures introduce large measurement errors that will cause attenuation bias, leading to under-rejection of the null hypothesis. Second, the structure of a dose-response function</p> <p><div class="equation"><div class="label">25</div><a href="#eq-m25" class="ar-modal-link"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-052.gif" alt="equation 25" /></a></div></p> <p>is often of interest. For example, we may be interested in nonlinearities or whether multiple dimensions of climate interact in important ways, requiring that measures of climate variables be near continuous and multidimensional. Third, if measures of <b>c</b> do not reflect scalable physical quantities in the real world, we may have little confidence that estimated effects are externally valid to other locations or to periods when the climate may change. For example, it is impossible to consider how cyclone intensification may affect outcomes if cyclone exposure is measured only as a binary variable. Fourth, pooling a sample of different locations may provide a valid average treatment effect of climatic conditions on the sample, but it may be a poor predictor of outcomes at any actual locations if the physical properties of events coded as similar are not actually physically similar. Finally, the result derived in the previous section, that time-series variations can be used to exactly identify marginal effects of the climate, can only hold if climatic variations are measured in such a way that an econometrician can identify marginal effects. For example, binary treatments are not differentiable, and so it may be difficult to determine if changing from no treatment to treatment is a marginal change.</p> <p>For all of the above reasons, many of the major innovations covered in the literature over the past decade have resulted from improvements in the measurement of climate variables, contributing at least as much to recent advances, if not more, than functional form innovations (discussed in Section 4).

When using time-series identification of climate effects, it is crucial to account for these ripple effects so that a local transient response is not mischaracterized as a persistent effect. Of particular concern is whether climatic events have a net effect on outcomes, or whether they simply displace outcomes across time and/or space.</p> <p>Thus far, we have only considered contemporaneous effects of the vector <b>c</b><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub> on outcome <i>Y</i><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub>. We now consider the influence of the entire vector field <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>, <i>t</i>) defined across all positions <i>s</i> and moments <i>t</i> on the outcome <i>Y</i><sub><i>i</i>τ</sub>.</p>  <p><div class="head-c">4.2.1. Temporal displacement.</div>A climatic event at time <i>t</i> might bring an event that would otherwise occur at time <i>t</i> + 1 forward in time, an effect known as temporal displacement or harvesting. For example, <a href="#" class="scrollRef B37 tooltip" refid="B37" id="XR177" title="  Deschênes  O, Moretti  E.  2009.  Extreme weather events, mortality and migration.  Rev. Econ.

Mathematically, the signature of temporal displacement is for periods following a climatic event to have a response that is opposite in sign to the contemporaneous response. A challenge to identifying these lagged effects is that the climatic histories of sequential moments overlap, so it may not be the case that outcomes at any moment are only a response to a single historical climate event. Rather, outcomes at each moment represent a superposition of many historical events each at a different moment in time. This issue can be resolved by conditioning expected outcomes on the complete history of climatic events using a distributed lag model:</p> <p><div class="equation"><div class="label">33</div><a href="#eq-m33" class="ar-modal-link"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/content/resource/2016/resource.2016.8.issue-1/annurev-resource-100815-095343/20160916/images/medium/eq-095343-063.gif" alt="equation 33" /></a></div></p> <p>where <i>l</i> is a lag length measured in periods (<i>l</i> = 0 indicates a contemporaneous observation), and the maximum lag length considered is <i>L</i>. The identifying assumption to this approach is that the influence of a climate event at τ<sub>0</sub> on outcomes at τ<sub>1</sub> is determined by the length of time τ<sub>1</sub>−τ<sub>0</sub> separating the observations. As written, this model also assumes additive separability between lagged effects, although this assumption can be relaxed by interacting lagged terms.

For this reason, belief effects are often described as adaptations to a climate, although this need not always be true (e.g., beliefs about the climate could serve simply as a coordinating mechanism). In this framework, adaptations can be defined as belief effects that interact with direct effects; for example, some agents believe it will be cold sometimes at a location, causing them to purchase coats (a belief effect), which reduces the chance they become ill after cold days (a direct effect). Multiple approaches have been used to document and quantify these adaptations.</p>  <p><div class="head-c">4.4.1. Indirect measurement via a cross section of levels.</div>One strategy for measuring the influence of adaptations is to estimate the effect of climate on some outcome that is influenced by adaptation using a cross-sectional research design (<a href="#eq-m8" class="ar-modal-link">Equation 8</a>).

Part 1: Benchmark estimates.  Environ. Resour. Econ.  21: 47–73">Tol 2002</a>). In principle, both approaches can be comprehensive, so long as top-down estimates are augmented with nonmarket impacts. In practice, bottom-up estimates may better account for the distributional costs of climate change (<a href="#" class="scrollRef B54 tooltip" refid="B54" id="XR268" title="  Houser  T, Hsiang  SM, Kopp  R, Larsen  K, Delgado  M,  et al.  2015.

When applying <a href="#eq-m37" class="ar-modal-link">Equation 37</a> to bottom-up projections, it is important to account for the covariance of impacts across different sectors to accurately construct the distribution of aggregate losses (<a href="#" class="scrollRef B54 tooltip" refid="B54" id="XR270" title="  Houser  T, Hsiang  SM, Kopp  R, Larsen  K, Delgado  M,  et al.  2015.

Developing strategies and techniques that can isolate and characterize a specific mechanism is critical for understanding why climatic factors matter. Testing for interactions with potential mediating factors that are plausibly exogenous (<a href="#" class="scrollRef B12 tooltip" refid="B12" id="XR271" title="  Barreca  A, Clay  K, Deschênes  O, Greenstone  M, Shapiro  JS.  2013.

San Francisco">Anttila-Hughes &amp; Hsiang 2012</a>) are all approaches that have been somewhat successful in specific contexts, although additional innovations in this area are needed, as these strategies are not always available.</p> <h3 class="subhead">6.2. Adaptation and General Equilibrium</h3> <p>As discussed above, adaptation to climate is thought to be economically important, but it has only been characterized in a limited number of cases. Notably, the costs of adaptations are almost never measured because they are usually not observed. Moreover, most measurements are partial equilibrium responses, whereas general equilibrium responses to climate, such as factor reallocations across space or time, are a form of adaptation thought to be important but about which little is known. Further, general equilibrium changes will result in changing prices, and knowing these adjustments is important for valuing quantity effects that are already understood. However, only a small number of studies have begun exploring these effects (<a href="#" class="scrollRef B25 tooltip" refid="B25" id="XR274" title="  Colmer  J.  2016.

Innovative strategies that can measure potential costs of unprecedented physical events, such as rapid sea level rise or ocean acidification, or that characterize the likelihoods of unprecedented social responses to climatic changes, such as mass migrations or state failures, are needed if these impacts are to be accounted for systematically in assessment exercises.</p> <h3 class="subhead">6.4. Integration with Theory and Numerical Models</h3> <p>Numerous theoretical models, including many used for integrated assessment policy analysis, have elements that describe climatic influence on economies (<a href="#" class="scrollRef B84 tooltip" refid="B84" id="XR277" title="  Nordhaus  WD.  1993.

For example, it is unknown if empirical calibration improves the out-of-sample forecast performance of these models or if all model parameters are even theoretically estimable using existing techniques.</p><h2 id="_i89"><span>7. CONCLUSION</span></h2> <p>Recent years have seen rapid innovation in the methods used to identify climatic influences on economies, with correspondingly rapid growth of insights that are reshaping how we understand the breadth and importance of climate–society interactions (<a href="#" class="scrollRef B24 tooltip" refid="B24" id="XR284" title="  Carleton  T, Hsiang  S.  2016.  Social and economic impacts of climate.  Science.

The new climate-economy literature.  J. Econ. Lit.  52: 740–98">Dell et al. 2014</a>). Key innovations have been in research design, the measurement of climatic factors, and the formulation of econometric models. In sharp contrast to the folk wisdom that “climate is not weather,” here I demonstrate that under fairly general conditions, weather variation, as it is used in many recent studies, exactly identifies the effect of climate—although many studies to date have not properly computed the effect of climatic changes when using these weather-derived parameters. Aggregation and synthesis of econometric findings have demonstrated a striking replicability of many recent findings across contexts, lending credibility both to the techniques that generate these results and to exercises where these results are applied to simulations of recent history or future climate changes. Many first-order partial equilibrium results are now well understood, yet major methodological innovations are still required to (<i>a</i>) tackle the key challenges of identifying mechanisms, (<i>b</i>) measure adaptation costs, general equilibrium, and price responses, (<i>c</i>) evaluate the effects of unprecedented events, and (<i>d</i>) more deeply integrate with theoretical and numerical policy models.</p><h2 id="_i90"><span class="smallcaps"><span class="smallcaps smallerCapital">disclosure statement</span></span></h2> <p>The author is not aware of any affiliations, memberships, funding, or financial holdings that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.</p><div class="ack"><h2 id="_i91"><span class="smallcaps"><span class="smallcaps smallerCapital">acknowledgments</span></span></h2> <p>I thank David Anthoff, Jesse Anttila-Hughes, Max Auffhammer, Alan Barrecca, Marshall Burke, Tamma Carleton, Olivier Deschênes, Tatyana Deryugina, Ram Fishman, Michael Greenstone, Michael Hanemann, Wu-Teh Hsiang, Bob Kopp, David Lobell, Gordon McCord, Kyle Meng, Billy Pizer, James Rising, Michael Roberts, Wolfram Schlenker, Christian Traeger, and seminar participants at Berkeley and Harvard for discussions and suggestions.
