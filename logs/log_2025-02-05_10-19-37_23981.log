**user**:
> I have a collection of Excel files, namesd savedrecs1.xls through savedrecs36.xls. They all have the same columns. In python, I want to read these all into a single pandas data frame. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by using the `pandas` library to read each Excel file and then concatenate them into a single DataFrame. Here's a step-by-step guide to doing that:
> 
> 1. **Import necessary libraries**:
>    Ensure you have `pandas` installed, and if you're going to handle Excel files directly, you'll also need `openpyxl` or `xlrd` depending on your file format.
> 
>    ```python
>    import pandas as pd
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Read and concatenate the files**:
>    Use a loop to read each file into a DataFrame and append it to a list, then concatenate all the DataFrames in the list into a single DataFrame.
> 
>    ```python
>    # List to store individual DataFrames
>    df_list = []
> 
>    # Loop through each file
>    for i in range(1, 37):
>        file_name = f'savedrecs{i}.xls'
>        df = pd.read_excel(file_name)
>        df_list.append(df)
> 
>    # Concatenate all DataFrames in the list into one DataFrame
>    combined_df = pd.concat(df_list, ignore_index=True)
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Verify the results**:
>    Make sure the concatenation has combined the files as expected by checking the shape or print a sample of the DataFrame.
> 
>    ```python
>    print(combined_df.shape)
>    print(combined_df.head())
>    ```
