**user**:
> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. One section is on recreational fishing, and it currently has the following information:
> 
> From 2011 to 2020, Delaware’s marine recreational fishing involved an average of 216,000 anglers annually, with a majority (125,000) coming from out-of-state. Shore fishing was the most popular, accounting for around 1.48 million trips, followed by private boating with approximately 788,000 trips. Atlantic croaker was the most commonly harvested species (average of 230 thousand fish), while summer flounder and bluefish were also popular targets. Tautog and black sea bass were notable for both their harvest and release numbers.

> Since writing this, we have wanted to incorporate the following edits:
> * We should start with a description of what recreational fishing actually refers to. Here is a description that was written separately: Recreational Fishing in Delaware refers to the hobby of catching different types of fish, like bluefish, cartilaginous fishes, catfishes, cods and hakes, dolphins, drums, eels, flounders, grunts, herrings, jacks, mullets, other fishes, porgies, puffers, sculpins, sea basses, searobins, temperate basses, toadfishes, triggerfishes/filefishes, tunas, mackerels, and wrasses., in Delaware's waters for non-commercial purposes. These waters are divided into three main areas: inland (rivers and lakes), nearshore (up to three miles from the coast), and offshore (beyond three miles). People generally do fishing from shore and fishing by charter boat, party boat and private / rental boat.
> * We have added a figure 28 which shows the three regions used for reporting recreational fishing catches. These are “inland”, “< 3 miles from shore” and “> 3 miles from shore”.
> * Figure 29 reports fish catches for each region, from the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP).
> * Figures 30 and 31 show recreational fishing activity from surveys. We introduce this with the text: “Recreational surveys can provide another perspective on the use of coastal and open waters for recreational fishing, although these show that recreational fishing by boat covers the planning area (see Figure 30).” However, this can be expanded. The two figures show data from the Delaware Recreational Uses survey which shows footprint of recreational fishing from boats (figure 30) and shore (figure 31).
> * You can also refer to “Table 2: Angler residence and fishing trip statistics.” (which shows how many anglers come from in-state and out-of-state and how many use boats vs. shore); and “Table 3: Recreational fishing harvest and catch-and-release in Delaware. The Key Species are the major species caught in Delaware.”

The aquatic species targeted range from bluefish, cartilaginous fishes, catfishes, cods and hakes, dolphins, drums, eels, flounders, grunts, herrings, jacks, mullets, and other marine species. These waters are categorized into three main areas crucial for recreational fishing: inland (rivers and lakes), near
