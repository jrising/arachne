**user**:
> My office computer runs Ubuntu and I have been happy with it. Now the department is looking into buying a site-wide license for Enterprise Linux. What are the advantages or differences for that?
**assistant**:
> Enterprise Linux, particularly Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), is often chosen by organizations for its commercial support, reliability, and wide range of features created with enterprise and business environments in mind. Here are a few key aspects that differentiate it from Ubuntu:
> 
> 1. **Commercial support:** The primary reason organizations choose RHEL is the level of support provided. Commercial support ensures that if anything goes wrong, the organization can rely on Red Hat's support team for immediate help.
> 
> 2. **Long-term stability:** Enterprise Linux distributions prioritize stability and reliability. They ensure this through long-term support releases, which receive updates and security patches for many years.
> 
> 3. **Enterprise feature set:** Enterprise Linux distributions include features tailored for business use, such as advanced management capabilities, high availability configurations, and comprehensive security policies.
> 
> 4. **Compatibility:** RHEL is compatible with a broad range of applications and hardware configurations, which is a key consideration for organizations.
> 
> 5. **Certification:** RHEL provides certification for skills, which is a value addition for employees and the organization.
> 
> 6. **Advanced features for large-scale operations:** Features like system rollbacks, the ability to run multiple versions of the same software with modularity, and scalability make a big difference in enterprise settings.
> 
> That said, Ubuntu is also a robust and reliable operating system, with its own set of advantages, including user-friendliness, ease of administration, and a large community of users for support. The decision between the two often comes down to what the organization values more: commercial support and enterprise-focused features (RHEL), or familiarity and free, community-based support (Ubuntu).
