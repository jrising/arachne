> Impact of physical climate risk and adaptation efforts on sovereigns’ credit assessments.
>  
> This deliverable examines how national adaptation efforts influence sovereign creditworthiness, borrowing costs, and access to international finance. It presents empirical evidence and modelling that physical climate risk is already impacting sovereign spreads and ratings—particularly in vulnerable economies—while adaptation remains under-recognised. Addressing this gap is essential to enabling fiscally constrained countries to attract investment for resilience and ensure financial markets support, rather than penalise, early adaptation action.

> 3.1 Climate – aware sovereigns: Considering physical climate risk and adaptation 
> 
> A country’s credit quality (i.e., the creditworthiness of the sovereign) determines its cost of borrowing (i.e., the yield of its sovereign bonds), which in turn influences the borrowing costs of the private sector. Interest rates for private sector loans vary widely across regions, with rates in emerging markets often two to four times higher than in developed economies, largely reflecting differences in government bond yields.  Hence, sovereign credit quality is continuously assessed by market participants, including institutional investors, multilateral banks, insurers, and international financial institutions, who lend or provide guarantees to a country and the businesses within it, as well as by credit rating agencies (CRAs), whose role is to evaluate a debt issuer’s ability to repay its debt.
> This paper explores how multiple stakeholders can better integrate the benefits of national-level climate adaptation investments into sovereign credit assessments. It,
> •	Reviews the most recent literature on how physical climate risks and adaptation efforts are considered in sovereign credit risk assessments,
> •	Describes how different stakeholders are incorporating physical climate risk and adaptation efforts into sovereign credit quality evaluations, 
> •	Examines the tools available to stakeholders for assessing adaptation efforts, and suggests ways governments can more effectively communicate their progress, and 
> •	Identifies emerging entry points and offers high-level recommendations to regulators and policy-makers to improve how both climate risks and adaptation efforts are priced into sovereign credit risk assessments.
> In interviews held between June and August 2025 by CFRF colleagues with a broad range of stakeholders including institutional investors, CRAs, data providers, banks, insurers, and multilateral development banks, there is broad consensus that physical climate risks are increasingly influencing sovereign credit assessments, particularly for highly vulnerable countries. Most stakeholders, however, emphasised that short-term climate risk forecasting remains constrained by data and modelling gaps, while long-term assessments are complicated by uncertainty around global warming trajectories. 
> At the same time, despite clear evidence that large-scale adaptation efforts can significantly reduce vulnerability and prevent future losses , their economic impact is still not sufficiently reflected in sovereign credit assessments. While long-term adaptation efforts are at times acknowledged, they often fall outside the short and medium-term horizons typically used in sovereign credit risk analysis, unless they have a demonstrable and/or immediate sizeable impact on a country’s fiscal stability or its external balance of payments.
> This suggests that financial markets are currently mispricing both climate-related risks and the value of adaptation efforts that build resilience and reduce vulnerability. Improving the understanding of these risks and finding ways to turn the long-term economic benefits of adaptation into short term financial benefits, would help unlock urgently needed investment in climate resilience, especially in emerging and developing economies. While generally less responsible for the bulk of historical emissions, these countries often face greater exposure to climate impacts and disasters that strain public finances, increasing the risk of credit downgrades and higher borrowing costs. This, in turn, restrains their capacity to invest in essential adaptation measures, making it critical that credit assessments recognise the value of early resilience-building efforts to help direct capital where it is most needed.
> 3.2 Empirical evidence: The impact of physical climate risk and adaptation on sovereign credit risk assessments
> 
> Sovereign credit assessments are constantly run by market participants, whose views are reflected in market signals such as bond yields (the price of debt), default spreads (the difference in yield between a particular sovereign and ‘risk-free’ or highest quality bonds), and Credit Default Swaps (the price of insurance against default). They are also carried out by credit rating agencies (CRAs), whose job is to evaluate an issuer’s ability to repay its debt in the near term. This section highlights empirical evidence from the recent literature on how physical climate risk and adaptation efforts affect sovereign credit quality assessments. 
> 
> 3.2.1 Physical climate risk affects the credit quality of the most vulnerable countries
> 
> Physical climate risks pose a material risk to government finances through both macroeconomic and contingent liability channels (Volz et al, 2020)  . The increasing frequency and severity of extreme events inhibits economic growth, which can impact government revenues. At the same time, the fiscal costs of climate-related disasters are significant as governments have to pay for reconstruction and recovery and will often act as insurers of last resort. The costs of physical climate risks can negatively impact a country’s debt sustainability and as a result their creditworthiness (Zenios, S., 2022) .  For example, following the 2022 floods in Pakistan that affected 33 million people and led to economic losses and damages of $30 billion, Fitch downgraded Pakistan’s credit rating from B- to CCC+ citing deteriorating external liquidity and falling exchange reserves, worsened by the fiscal impacts of the flooding (Fitch, 2022) . [Placeholder: add impact in 10y yields]. 
> Research suggests that countries highly exposed to physical climate risks face higher costs of debt. In an econometric analysis of 46 countries, Kling et al (2018)  found that the most climate-vulnerable countries pay a risk premium on their debt. Similarly, Bingler et al (2022)  found that the long-term bond yields of lower rated countries’ (AA- and below) increased with climate risk exposure. While Beirne et al (2021) , found a similar “climate risk premium” on sovereign debt in Southeast Asian countries. These studies suggest that physical climate risk is starting to be priced into some sovereign debt markets. This risk premium reflects market expectations that climate-vulnerable countries may face greater fiscal stress and higher default probabilities. In a panel study of 116 countries between 1995-2017, Cevik and Jalles (2021)  confirmed this relationship empirically, finding that countries with greater climate risks had measurably higher default probabilities, with the effect being most pronounced in low-income countries. 
> Empirical evidence suggests that climate risk exposure has had a downward effect on a country’s credit rating, particularly for developing countries and those with lower ratings (Sun et al, 2023 ; Cevik and Jalles, 2020 ). The sovereign rating impacts of climate change are projected to get worse in the future. When combining future climate-change macroeconomic loss projections with an empirically-derived sovereign rating model, Klusak et al (2023)  find that 59 countries could face downgrades as early as 2030 (0.68 notch average), rising to 81 countries (2.18 notch average) by 2100 . 
> 3.2.2 Credit risk sensitivity to adaptation varies widely across countries
> 
> Research connecting a country’s adaptative capacity to its credit risk assessment remains limited and faces some challenges for researchers. Resilience of a country toward the effects of climate change and it being considered creditworthy may both be outcomes of similar economic and institutional processes. To evaluate readiness (i.e., a country's ability to leverage investments and convert them into effective climate adaptation actions), the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) data relies on similar variables that have been shown to already be meaningful for credit risk assessment (De Moor et al, 2018) . This observation drives some of the empirical challenges underpinning this work. 
> Despite this, researchers that have variously applied the ND-GAIN data in this context to evaluate resilience and adaptive capacity (see Cappiello et al, 2024 ;  Ferrazzi et al, 2021 and Cevik & Jalles, 2022)  find that adaptive capacity is important for credit outcomes. Other work relies upon underlying macroeconomic models that incorporate adaptation as an intrinsic component in their model (Klusak et al, 2023) . This body of work connects deviations of temperature and precipitation to macroeconomic fundamentals, where it is deviations from a baseline that drive economic consequences. The principle behind this idea is that economies will naturally adapt over a medium-term horizon. For example, in a fast adaptation scenario, the economy is sensitive to deviations from a twenty-year average temperature baseline. A slower adaptation scenario may consider windows of up to 40 years (see Mohaddes & Raissi, (2024)  and Kahn et al, (2021)  for a discussion on this class of models). Research shows that credit risk outcomes are sensitive to these adaptation assumptions and, the difference in the credit impact between slow and fast adaptation is much larger for some countries than it is for others (Klusak et al, 2023) . 
> Examples of recent work that deviate from both of these approaches include Bernhofen et al (2024) . This work constructs a bespoke climate flood risk assessment for Thailand, uses the IMF’s DIGNAD model to evaluate the impact on the economy and finally, uses the same credit risk model in Klusak et al (2023) to establishes credit risk impacts. This work avoids the empirical challenges described above and incorporates adaptation directly. <add the reference to Thailand’s box/example elsewhere in CFRF report> 
> In sum, the empirical evident suggests that physical climate risks are increasingly reflected in sovereign credit markets, especially for vulnerable countries, while the role of adaptation in shaping creditworthiness remains uneven and under-integrated.
> 3.3 The case for adaptation and resilience efforts to reduce vulnerability 
> 
> This section begins by outlining the physical climate risk function, and the economic rationale for early adaptation emphasising the benefits of proactive measures in reducing climate-related vulnerabilities. It then summarises how various finance providers, including institutional investors, banks, multilateral development banks (MDBs), as well as insurers, and credit rating agencies (CRAs), are currently evaluating the financial case for adaptation as reported during the interviews.
> Estimating physical climate risk for a given entity (a sovereign, a sub-sovereign, or a private business), involves assessing the interaction between climate-related hazards, its exposure to those hazards, and its underlying vulnerability. In turn, an entity’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change is shaped by two main factors: its sensitivity and its adaptive capacity. Sensitivity, refers to the extent to which it is likely to be affected by climate hazards given its inherent characteristics; the degree and likelihood it can absorb and rebound from shocks. Adaptive capacity refers to the ability to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences .

> Adaptation and resilience investments can reduce sensitivity by altering the inherent characteristics of a country that make it vulnerable, for example, by upgrading infrastructure, diversifying crops, or improving health systems. These investments can also enhance adaptive capacity, increasing the country’s ability to adjust, respond, and recover, for example through early warning systems, institutional strengthening, or access to climate finance. While these measures do not reduce exposure or the hazard itself, they significantly improve the country’s ability to cope with and adapt to climate impacts.
> Crucially, if investors, insurers, and finance providers focus solely on reducing short- and medium-term exposure to physical climate risks, they risk exacerbating systemic vulnerability over the long term. In a globalised economy with deeply interconnected value chains, vulnerabilities in one region can cascade across others, posing significant risks, particularly for universal owners such as pension funds, who are exposed across multiple geographies and sectors. A more holistic approach that also addresses sensitivity and builds adaptive capacity is essential for ensuring long-term resilience and risk mitigation.
> 3.3.1. The economic case for early action 
> 
> A growing body of research underscores the compelling economic case for early investment in adaptation and resilience. Reports consistently suggest that every dollar spent today can yield significant returns in the future, ranging from $2 to $43 in avoided losses and recovery costs, depending on the market and sector . A recent analysis focused on the UK, estimates benefit-cost ratios of 2:1 to 10:1, meaning each £1 invested could generate £2 to £10 in net economic gains .
> While the studies vary in granularity and present a wide range of cost-benefit estimates, the overall trend points to rising benefit-cost ratios for adaptation and resilience (A&R) investments. The report From Risk to Reward by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the Global Resilience Partnership (GRP)   highlights the growing gap between current investment levels and the potential value of adaptation, positioning climate resilience as a strategic opportunity for businesses and private investors. Data across both advanced and emerging economies shows that protecting value at risk through A&R measures can yield substantial financial returns.
> 3.3.2. Finance and insurance providers are starting to assess country’s adaptation efforts 
> 
> Despite the strong economic rationale for large-scale adaptation efforts to reduce vulnerability and avoid future losses , the financial case in the short term remains underappreciated. Although finance and insurance providers are starting to assess country’s adaptation efforts and support resilience investment to some degree, most stakeholders continue to focus primarily on risk mitigation. Improving the understanding of the economic benefits of adaptation and strengthening the financial case for near-term investment in A&R, is essential to unlock further private investment, especially in emerging and developing economies. 
> Institutional Investors
> Institutional Investors (pension funds and asst managers) are at different stages in assessing both physical climate risks and adaptation efforts of sovereign bonds issuers. Most investors report struggles with scenarios analysis that are granular enough to be decision useful, but there is consensus that data and modelling is rapidly improving. Some pointed that short-term climate risk forecasting remains constrained by data and modelling gaps, while long-term assessments are complicated by perennial uncertainty around current global warming trajectories. Those who are more climate aware, are carefully assessing both physical and transition climate risks, considering impacts across atmospheric, water, and nature systems, and their economic implications. They evaluate adaptation and mitigation plans in tandem with a country’s fiscal capacity to implement them, recognising that lower-income countries face significant budgetary constraints. From a portfolio management perspective, investors primarily focus on directionality; they care about assessing the extent to which risks are priced by the market and what chance there is that the risk will be priced on a 1-2 year time frame.
> Institutional investors are increasingly recognising opportunities in climate adaptation and resilience within the bond market, and expressed expectations for further growth as adaptation and resilience taxonomies continue to evolve. A&R taxonomies such as the Climate Bonds Resilience Taxonomy , offer clear guidance on what qualifies as a resilient investment. Some jurisdictions, like Hong Kong, have begun integrating climate adaptation into the use of proceeds for green bonds, directing funds toward infrastructure upgrades to withstand events like typhoons. The challenge remains in ensuring these commitments are reflected in actual use-of-proceeds and impact reports. Examples from the Netherlands and Hong Kong show progress, but broader implementation remains uneven.
> Lastly, investors also noted that subnational entities are becoming important entry points for channelling finance into climate adaptation and resilience. They are increasingly engaging with these issuers, requesting detailed adaptation plans and fiscal risk assessments, often supported by consultancies that help quantify the costs of inaction. While this kind of dialogue is emerging at the sub-sovereign level, similar practices are still largely absent in the sovereign bond space, suggesting a missed opportunity for broader systemic impact.
> Commercial Banks
> Commercial banks, are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their approach, assessing both risk and adaptive capacity to shape overall strategy, support internal decision-making, and guide government lending activities. Standard Chartered uses a set of Physical and Transition Risk rankings to identify the markets most vulnerable and least ready to adapt and mitigate climate-related Physical and Transition Risks. These rankings are used as qualitative and quantitative inputs to internal Country Risk management process spanning annual sovereign credit grades and limits reviews, inputs to climate-related scenario analysis, and Risk Appetite. 
> 
> As a key source of funding for national governments, A&R investments represent a massive win-win opportunity for banks and financial institutions: not only do they open avenues for expanding lending, but they also enhance the creditworthiness of recipient countries by reducing climate-related fiscal risks. Standard Chartered’s Adaptation Economy Report examines the need for adaptation investment in 10 developing markets (Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, the UAE and Vietnam). For the 10 markets in this study, failure to invest an estimated USD 30.4 billion this decade – the minimum projected level to adapt to climate damages as they occur – could lead to a cost of USD376.6 billion in damages and lost growth by the end of 2030 (in a 1.5°C warming scenario). 
> Multilateral development banks (MDBs)
> For concessional funders like multilateral development banks, credit quality assessments typically have a short to medium term horizon, limiting visibility of long-term impacts from climate resilience or adaptation efforts. However, adaptation costs and benefits are increasingly quantified, based on estimated losses and adjusted for fiscal capacity. 
> The Triple Resilience Dividend  concept offers a compelling framework for evaluating climate adaptation investments. It highlights three layers of benefits: reduced losses from climate impacts, increased economic activity, and wider co-benefits such as improved health, social cohesion, and ecosystem services. This approach, adopted by concessional funders, underscores the case for early and strategic investment in resilience, especially in developing markets.
> MDBs have pioneered the issuance of A&R bonds to scale climate adaptation finance. In 2019, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) issued the world’s first dedicated climate resilience bond, raising US$700 million to fund projects aligned with the Climate Resilience Principles . These bonds support investments that strengthen the ability of infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems to withstand climate shocks. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also issued a bond in 2019 which featured adaptation and resilience activities. through its Green, Social, Sustainable, and Other Labelled (GSS+) Bonds Initiative, aims to catalyse over $1 billion in sustainable bond issuances by 2025, including resilience bonds, to finance climate investments and strengthen resilience across Southeast Asia. The ADB has supported the issuance of sustainable bonds—including resilience-focused instruments—across ASEAN+3 markets, contributing to a total outstanding volume of USD 917.6 billion by year-end.  These instruments mark a shift toward proactive, systems-level investment in resilience, particularly critical for regions most exposed to climate impacts.
> Insurers 
> [Placeholder: discuss insurance sub-section – see comment] [for discussion]
> Consider this, based on interview: With regards to asset side of the balance sheet (i.e., insurers as investors) sovereign credit assessments do integrate PCR, but often indirectly through ratings used by investment team. Location-specific risk intelligence is not consistently applied, and analysis does not explicitly reflect vulnerability assessments. 
> In their liability side of the balance sheet (as insurance underwriters) they use a stochastic model approach for different hazards, which hugely differ from NFGS’ Integrated Assessment Models. There is a big difference between DM and EMs, where protection gasp are much wider, leading to higher net risk and less appetite or higher costs for underwriting insurance. A major challenge in these regions is the lack of granular data—especially on vulnerability and tax income distribution—which makes sovereign risk modelling more difficult. To assess adaptive capacity, insurers rely on data such as National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), GDP distribution, land use maps, sectoral exposure, insurance coverage, and hazard-specific resilience infrastructure.
> Engagement with governments remains fragmented. There is no centralised unit for sovereign engagement, but insurers typically interact through industry associations, local initiatives (such as Morocco’s agricultural fund or Mexico’s earthquake pool), and development agencies seeking risk assessments in data-poor regions. These efforts aim to improve climate resilience and close protection gaps, particularly in vulnerable economies.
> Swenja’s section adapted - The insurance sector is playing a growing role in helping governments and financial institutions manage physical climate risks. Through risk transfer mechanisms, insurers provide a financial safety net that supports economic stability and reduces the burden on households, businesses, and governments. Tailored (re)insurance solutions, backed by strong analytics and data, are helping Ministries of Finance and rating agencies better understand and prepare for climate-related shocks.
> Advanced tools like catastrophe models (CAT models) enable insurers to estimate potential losses from extreme events and guide decisions on public insurance schemes, financial reserves, and infrastructure investment. The sector also promotes risk layering—a strategic approach to combining financial instruments to manage climate risks effectively. By helping quantify and address the insurance protection gap, especially in low-income countries, insurers are supporting more resilient economies and encouraging proactive public finance strategies that reduce systemic risk and promote sustainable development.
> Addition of the resurgence and price function of CAT Bonds. As governments, insurers, and development institutions seek ways to transfer disaster risk to capital markets, issuance volumes of CAT bonds (catastrophe bonds) have seen a notable surge in recent years, driven by growing awareness of climate risks and the need for innovative financial instruments to manage them. CAT bonds are structured so that investors lose part or all of their principal if a predefined catastrophe occurs. The yield (or spread) investors demand reflects their perceived risk of that event happening. By analysing the pricing of CAT bonds market participants can infer the implied probability of the triggering event. As new data (e.g. climate models, disaster forecasts, or actual events) emerge, CAT bond prices adjust, offering a real-time reflection of changing risk perceptions.
> 3.3.3. The perspective of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)
> 
> Rating agencies are increasingly aware of the risks that climate change poses to sovereign creditworthiness. The big three rating agencies (Standard & Poors, Moody’s, and Fitch) have all published reports on the link between climate change and sovereign credit risk (Fitch, 2025 ; Moody’s 2016 ; S&P, 2023 ) and have begun to develop methodologies for accounting for climate risk within their rating methodologies. 
> Consistent with their mandate to assess probability of default in the near term, their analysis is focused on whether climate-related events visibly and measurably impact a sovereign’s ability to service debt. In other words, for most, physical climate risks are considered only to the extent that they are immediately material to a country’s fiscal and socioeconomic conditions. This is consistent with a recent study by Andersen et al, 2025 , which finds no evidence that climate risk systematically affects ratings or that its influence has evolved over time reflecting credit rating agencies' short- to medium-term focus on economic fundamentals rather than on long-term climate risks.
> When assessing physical climate risks, credit rating agencies draw on a range of models, data sources, and scoring systems, often applying expert and qualitative judgment to evaluate how climate hazards affect a country’s vulnerability and interact with broader economic and political dynamics. Most reported that these assessments inform in-country engagements and consultations. These assessments vary in sophistication; some use heat maps or scoring frameworks, yet these are not granular enough to calculate precise probabilities, partly due to underlying uncertainties in climate projections and data limitations. 
> CRAs recognise that national adaptation investments, such as large-scale resilient infrastructure, or desalination projects, can reduce climate vulnerability and help stabilise credit ratings. However, their influence on ratings depends heavily on the credibility and governance of the investment plans, their near-term fiscal relevance, and the likelihood of implementation. For example, developed economies like the Netherlands face significant sea level rise risks but have a long history of investing in coastal defence. In contrast, emerging and developing economies often struggle with limited data, severe fiscal constraints, and implementation uncertainty, which hinders the systematic integration of adaptation measures into credit ratings. In most situations adaptation investments are more likely to prevent rating downgrades, than to trigger upgrades. Belize’s experience highlights how fiscal reforms drive credit rating improvements more so than environmental factors. On March 2017, Standard & Poor’s downgraded Belize to Selective Default (SD) due to its distressed exchange criteria. However, following the completion of fiscal restructuring, the agency upgraded Belize’s foreign currency rating to B- with a stable outlook.  The environmental components of the use of proceeds had little influence on these movements. 
> Although credit ratings are widely used by regulators and investors, and can thus influence market rates, they tend to lag market movements. Studies have shown that bond spreads and CDS prices often reflect deteriorating credit conditions before rating agencies issue downgrades.  Rating agencies cannot react as quickly as markets, making it more useful for investors to act ahead of rating changes. As a result, market indicators like yields and spreads can be just as important and informative, if not more so, than the ratings themselves. Credit ratings, however, remain influential in the context of prudential regulation, shaping strategic asset allocation decisions across investors and lending decision for banks.
> 
> Box [2] - Emerging and developing economies (EMDEs)
> Despite contributing less to historical emissions, EMDEs face a disproportionate share of climate impacts, as highlighted by the IPCC and other global assessments.  This creates a clear tension between how risk is assessed and where investment is most needed. These economies typically face higher physical risks and have lower adaptive capacity yet applying the same risk lens across all markets risks disincentivising investment in the regions that need it most. For example, when risk assessments aggregate exposure at the country level without accounting for local resilience efforts or sector-specific opportunities, investments in these regions may appear disproportionately risky. While some EM portfolio managers acknowledge this tension, firms often struggle to integrate it systematically, largely due to the limited fiscal space, and macroeconomic vulnerabilities which heightens these countries’ exposure to the economic consequences of climate change.
> To address this, there is growing momentum to review both domestic and international financial regulations to ensure they do not disadvantage developing countries in accessing climate finance and are applied proportionately. There is also a call for improved benchmarks, clearer standards, and greater education at senior levels to better account for the systemic risks of underinvesting in adaptation and resilience, and to align climate goals with investment performance.
> There is also a significant gap between the availability of climate-related data and the capacity of emerging market treasuries to engage with it. While investors can access extensive datasets, especially from niche providers, for sovereign bond analysis, some finance ministries in developing countries still lack the expertise or resources to discuss climate risk mitigation and adaptation in meaningful detail. This is not universally true, however, with some emerging markets leading with example (e.g., India, Chile). In contrast, some developed markets, may avoid these discussions altogether due to political sensitivities. Greater support in data collection and free availability, and capacity building efforts could enable more informed and constructive dialogue between issuers and investors on climate-related financial risks.
> The impact of climate events on sovereign debt is influenced by the presence of private insurance. In developed economies, much of the financial burden from climate-related damages is absorbed by the private sector through insurance and reinsurance. It is however important to note that this comes with a few nuances. Despite the cushion that private sector insurance may provide, this still may not remove the risk of direct asset value impact and indirect destruction of asset values in case of a climate event depending on the percentage of insured versus uninsured in the geographic location. In addition, it may also serve to kick the can down the road for public-private collaboration on adaptation projects while raising issues of affordability across consumers and industry depending on the cost of insurance in areas with high climate physical risk. In contrast, emerging markets often lack such coverage, meaning similar climate events can have a much greater and a much more immediate fiscal impact on their public balance sheets. For example, the property protection gaps in key emerging regions are typically over 90%. In the US, Oceania and Western Europe, they are typically 30-40% resulting in approx. average GDP losses 4 x higher in EMDEs compared to high income countries .
> 
> 3.4. Tools to assess physical climate risk and country adaptive capacity
> 
> This section points to some tools to assess physical risk and adaptive capacity at country level some of which were frequently referenced during consultations with different stakeholders.
> Adaptation is a dynamic and evolving process that cannot be captured by a single metric. Fundamentally, indicators of adaptive capacity are subjective and seek to capture a collection of means, readily deployable to deal with sector-specific climate change impacts. As climate hazards vary significantly across countries and regions, measuring adaptive capacity, requires tailored, granular analyses that reflect local vulnerabilities, capacities, and priorities. 
> While data availability remains a challenge, there is a growing number of tools and frameworks, many of which originate from the disaster risk management field, that can support the assessment of climate adaptation and resilience. Leveraging tools developed for disaster risk analysis can provide valuable insights into climate vulnerabilities and help inform more targeted, context-specific adaptation strategies. 
> The table below highlights some frequently mentioned tools to assess physical climate risk and country adaptive capacity that are at least partially openly available. Commercial data providers, not included in this list, have also been substantially and continuously improving their offering responding to growing investor demand. 
> Benchmarks and knowledge portals assess adaptive capacity in different but complementary ways. Benchmarks provide scores or rankings across countries and use standardised indicators to compare adaptive capacity. For example, the ND-GAIN (Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative) Country Index uses 45 indicators to assess a country's vulnerability and readiness for climate change. These indicators are grouped into vulnerability and readiness components, which are further broken down into sectors including food, water and infrastructure. The index helps governments, businesses and communities prioritize adaptation efforts and investments.
> Knowledge portals provide extensive datasets, case studies, and can be used for research and policy design. For example, the UNEP Adaptation Gap Report provides an annual assessment of global progress on climate change adaptation, focusing on planning, financing, and implementation. It has found that progress in adaptation financing is not fast enough to close the enormous gap between needs and flows, which contributes to a continued lag in adaptation planning and implementation efforts .

> [Placeholder: develop and include a mention to Risk and resilience metrics project led by Howden, AAL/GDP, etc] For adaptation economics (to develop). NFGS results work based on “hit to GDP growth” from climate losses. Perhaps companies can work based on “hit to projected revenue growth” over a given time period and scenario (absent of adaptation) as the financial basis for their adaptation investment. There can be other KPIs of course, e.g. days of productivity lost.
> 
> NGFS-modelling
> Conventional global climate impact models (CIMs) and integrated assessment models (IAMs) do not always treat adaptation in a nuanced way, but the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) can be used to better represent adaptive capacity. CIMs primarily assess the ways in which biophysical hazards will impact human and other ecosystems while IAMs look for solutions to climate change, traditionally focusing on mitigation. 
> Climate adaptation is typically modelled as autonomous rather than planned and often does not incorporate the differential ability between countries to deploy adaptation strategies (i.e. modelled as full adaptation vs no adaptation, which misses the range of possibilities in between that are shaped by socioeconomic contexts). Given these shortfalls, there is a body of research that adaptive capacity can be represented within the framework of the SSPs, which explore the range of future pathways of socioeconomic development and are consistently used within the global climate change community. Notably, global CIMs and IAMs that operate with the SSPs are expected to be able to absorb scenario-resolved information about adaptive capacity. Indicators can be used for scenario-based assessments of adaptive capacity. These indicators are suitable because they broadly cover relevant dimensions, are consistent with underlying SSP narratives, and can help identify key investment areas. 
> National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) often outline national-level adaptation goals and strategies. However, these documents vary widely in format and content, with limited standardisation across countries. They are more commonly available for developing nations, creating an uneven landscape of information. Importantly, while these documents present plans and intentions, they do not always indicate the extent to which these strategies will be implemented, making it difficult to assess actual progress on adaptation. [for discussion]
> 3.4.1 Assessing the adaptation policy cycle - How countries communicate adaptation needs, efforts and plans 
> 
> Practical guidance and examples of best practice on adaptation policy development can support countries in better managing physical climate risk. The annual UN Adaptation Gap Reports analyse different aspects of adaptation planning instruments to assess its adequacy and effectiveness, with changing but similar approaches every year. These reports examine published national adaptation policies (including adaptation plans) and evaluate whether they cover different types of physical risks and whether adaptation measures align with the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience (FGCR). The Adaptation Gap Reports recommend incorporating stakeholder engagement, gender considerations and specific incentives, regulations, and governance structures into the adaptation planning process. Countries should also publish the costs of adaptation measures with financing sources identified and explain how adaptation will be implemented at the sectoral and sub-national levels. They should also aim to publish monitoring and evaluating results. 
> Building on this guidance, Assessing Sovereign Climate-related Opportunities and Risks (ASCOR), an investor-led initiative, provides comprehensive data on how countries are managing the transition, physical, and social risks related to climate change. The ASCOR tool is open source and relies on a publicly available methodology. In the context of physical risk, it evaluates four adaptation planning indicators and two disaster risk reduction indicators for 70 countries (areas CP5 and CF2): 
> i.	Has the country published a National Adaptation Plan (NAP)?
> ii.	Does the country regularly publish national climate risk assessments?
> iii.	Has the country published a Monitoring & Evaluation report on implementing adaptation?
> iv.	Has the country disclosed a transparent breakdown of the costs of adaptation measures? 
> v.	Does the country have a multi-hazard early warning system? 
> vi.	Is the country part of a sovereign catastrophe risk pool? 
> 
> As highlighted in State of Transition in Sovereigns 2024, findings from the ASCOR data yield examples of emerging good practice that can be used as guidance by peer countries. National risk assessments should cover all types of physical risk that are relevant to the country. Based on ASCOR findings, among the 42 countries with a published national risk assessment, most cover more than two risks. Chile’s climate risk assessment, for example, is comprehensive and easy to access on the Climate Atlas online platform.
> Given the changing nature of physical risk, NAPs should be updated based on the latest risk assessments. The ASCOR analysis finds that many NAPs are outdated: on average, they were published 6 years ago, while the average risk assessment was conducted 7 years ago. This pattern highlights potential capacity and financial barriers to conducting regular updates. For instance, Egypt and Kazakhstan are developing their NAPs with funding from the Green Climate Fund since 2017. In contrast, Denmark has published three adaptation planning instruments: the National Adaptation Strategy (2008) and National Adaptation Plans (2012 and 2023).
> In addition, reporting on the progress of implementing adaptation measures is essential for adjusting priorities over time. Since 2008, Spain has issued a NAP progress and evaluation report every three years, while the UK have periodically reviewed and updated their Adaptation Plan based on progress reports – now in its third iterations (NAP3) for 2023-2028 . 
> Implementation at the sectoral level is important since focusing on only a few sectors may miss important economic vulnerabilities. A case of leading good practice is Chile, which has an economy-wide NAP as well as eight sector-specific NAPs focused sector-specific risks and actions to build resilience. 
> To attract finance and successfully implement national adaptation goals, countries should assess the costs of their intended adaptation actions. This can be done at the sectoral level or more granularly for specific measures or projects. For example, Egypt’s NDC outlines the costs of specific adaptation programmes to enhance agricultural production in the Valley and Delta regions. Egypt is among the countries that disclose adaptation costs in their NDC rather than in a NAP. Improving the coherence between NDCs and NAPs can enhance the planning process and its transparency.
> Tracking and disclosing adaptation-related fiscal measures enables taxpayers and investors to verify whether governments are allocating public funds to prepare for extreme weather events. ASCOR assesses the disclosure of climate-related expenditures (area CF3), finding that emerging good practice is to publish annually and to link expenditures to national climate strategies. For example, the Philippines maps adaptation expenditures in their annual budget and tags them according to the strategic priorities of its Climate Change Action Plan.

> Box [3] - The issuers’ perspective - How Ministries of Finance Can Address Sovereign Risk Rating Concerns About Physical Climate Risks
> Ministries of Finance (MoFs) are increasingly recognised as central actors in managing the fiscal and macroeconomic implications of physical climate risks. As highlighted in the Coalition of Finance’s Ministers HP4 Report on Physical Climate Risks and Adaptation (June 2025), MoFs can strengthen their credibility with investors and sovereign risk rating agencies by demonstrating a clear understanding of climate-related risks and integrating them into fiscal policy and economic planning. Key actions that can support this include:
> •	Integrating climate risk into fiscal frameworks, including national budgets, debt sustainability analyses, and public investment planning.
> •	Developing costed and forward-looking National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) linked to medium-term expenditure frameworks.
> •	Prioritizing resilient infrastructure investments and establishing contingency funds or insurance mechanisms.
> •	Mainstreaming adaptation into public financial management and fiscal decision-making.
> •	
> Despite growing awareness , the Coalition’s Global Survey of Ministries of Finance (June 2025) reveals that only a minority of MoFs systematically assess sovereign climate risk using formal tools. According to the survey, few MoFs have developed costed national adaptation plans that are linked to medium-term expenditure frameworks or debt sustainability analyses. Challenges highlighted in the survey include:
> •	Limited data and analytical capacity for quantifying long-term risks.
> •	Fragmented governance and coordination.
> •	Tight fiscal space and competing priorities.
> •	Lack of standardized disclosure frameworks.
> 
> Encouragingly, the Coalition’s Compendium of Practice Summary Report (June 2025) showcases emerging good practices. Some MoFs are embedding climate resilience criteria into public investment systems, screening infrastructure projects for climate risks, and using dashboard tools to consolidate data on hazards, exposure, and fiscal vulnerability. These tools support more transparent communication with investors and rating agencies.
> 
> As the work of the Coalition shows, there is strong demand among MoFs for peer learning, technical assistance, and standardized tools to assess and disclose climate-related sovereign risks. A global framework for aligning adaptation planning with sovereign risk rating criteria could help bridge current gaps and support more resilient fiscal governance.

> 
> 3.5. Promising developments and high-level recommendations 
> 
> Most stakeholders continue to prioritise near-term concerns, with limited recognition of tail risks such as the potential impacts of climate tipping points, and insufficient attention and support for strengthening adaptive capacity and or reducing sensitivity to reduce vulnerability and avoid future economic and social losses. Encouragingly, progress in data quality, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the growing sophistication of climate risk analysis is deepening our understanding of adaptive capacity and enabling more informed, forward-looking decision-making.
> 3.5.1 Entry points and green shoots
> 
> Driven by growing investor and market pressure, the quality and availability of climate adaptation data tools are rapidly improving.	Notably, major data vendors now employ robust climate science modelling teams, enhancing the credibility and granularity of risk assessments. This progress is enabling more precise quantification of adaptation costs and benefits, often based on projected climate-related losses and adjusted for a country’s fiscal capacity. These advancements are helping financial institutions and policymakers make more informed, data-driven decisions in the face of escalating climate risks.[for discussion]
> 
> Multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder collaborations are playing a critical role in advancing climate resilience and adaptation finance.	The PCRAM case studies , which bring together climate scientists, engineers, and finance professionals, have demonstrated that resilience investments can enhance value and could be scaled to the sovereign level to identify priority investments in critical sectors. Country platforms are also emerging as effective mechanisms for fostering dialogue among investors, governments, concessional funders, and other key actors in the climate finance ecosystem. Additionally, initiatives like the EMDE Investor Taskforce, a multi-year, multi-stakeholder programme based in the UK, are working to mobilise capital for emerging markets and developing economies, further highlighting the importance of coordinated, cross-sectoral efforts in addressing climate challenges.
> With the rapid expansion of adaptation and resilience (A&R) taxonomies , there is growing momentum toward increased issuance of green and resilience bonds.	both at the corporate and sovereign levels, with a greater share of proceeds expected to be allocated specifically to climate adaptation. These taxonomies are helping to clarify eligible activities, standardize reporting, and build investor confidence, thereby incentivizing issuers to channel more capital into resilience-focused projects. As a result, the market is likely to see a notable rise in adaptation-related bond issuance in the near future.
> Subnational action on climate adaptation and resilience is gaining momentum.	Investors highlighted that they are increasingly requesting detailed adaptation and resilience plans from sub-national issuers, including assessments of the fiscal implications of climate impacts. This is particularly true in the U.S., where municipal and county-level bond issuance is the most active, but also in India and other jurisdictions. Smaller economic consultancies often support this process by quantifying the costs of inaction versus the benefits of adaptation investments. While this kind of engagement is emerging at the sub-sovereign level, similar practices have yet to be widely adopted at national level.

> 
> 3.5.2 High-level recommendations for policy makers and regulators [for discussion]
> 
> To unlock much-needed private investment in climate adaptation and resilience, that would support credit risk profiles of both sovereigns and corporates within them, governments and regulators can take a series of measures to: a) enhance the understanding of physical climate risk and the economic benefits of adaptation through improved information and disclosure, and b) strengthen the financial case for near-term investment in A&R through smart regulation and targeted incentives. 
> Enhancing information and disclosure
> 1.	Make risk information a public good. Governments should ensure that climate and disaster risk information is publicly accessible, comprehensive, transparent, and integrated into national budgets and economic surveys. This data should be aggregated at both national and subnational levels—particularly for high-risk areas such as coastal zones—and made freely available to support informed decision-making across sectors.
> 2.	Clarify the definition of resilience investments. Policymakers should establish clear criteria to distinguish between routine development (e.g. standard drainage systems) and genuine investments in climate adaptation and resilience. This clarity is essential for tracking progress, allocating resources effectively, and avoiding the misclassification of development deficits as adaptation finance.
> 3.	Support the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and the development of adaptation indicators. These efforts provide a coordinated framework for building national resilience to climate change. The GGA, established under the Paris Agreement, sets out broad targets across key sectors like food, water, health, and infrastructure. To track progress, a technical process has refined thousands of potential indicators down to a practical set of 100. By advancing convergence around these measurable indicators, governments can better monitor adaptation efforts, identify gaps, guide investment decisions, and ultimately strengthen both climate resilience and economic stability. 
> 4.	Strengthen communication and long-term planning for adaptation investment. Governments should clearly identify and cost priority adaptation measures in their NDCs and NAPs and improve coherence between these plans to enhance transparency and attract finance. Publishing multiple climate scenarios—including worst-case projections—can help investors understand fiscal risks and resilience needs. At the same time, embedding long-term thinking into adaptation strategies, beyond short political or budget cycles, is essential. Adopting multi-decade planning approaches (e.g., France’s), can align infrastructure, finance, and policy with future climate realities, ensuring sustained resilience outcomes.
> 5.	Strengthen mandatory climate risk disclosure and accounting standards. Regulators should require consistent and transparent climate risk disclosures to help investors understand and price physical climate risks. Enhanced disclosure and transparency will also support central banks and financial supervisors in managing systemic climate-related risks. This includes advancing the implementation of international accounting standards and increased focused on estimating climate-related contingent liabilities and potential provisions. 
> Improving incentives to strengthen the financial case for adaptation and resilience investment
> 6.	Strengthen climate-resilient procurement standards. Regulatory frameworks for public procurement, especially for large-scale infrastructure, must incorporate climate risk parameters. For example, infrastructure in coastal regions should be designed to withstand extreme wind speeds, which can increase damage by over 200%. Embedding such standards will reduce long-term vulnerability and economic losses.
> 7.	Implement levies and repurpose harmful subsidies to expand fiscal space and correct market signals for adaptation and resilience. Levies on high-emission sectors like shipping and aviation can generate predictable funding, while redirecting fossil fuel subsidies can shift incentives toward climate- and nature-positive investments. 
> 8.	Design smart regulation and targeted fiscal incentives to strengthen the short-term financial case for resilience investment. Drawing on models like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, governments can catalyse private capital and innovation for adaptation and resilience solutions. Coordination with sub-national entities is key, as many effective adaptation initiatives originate locally and complement and can inform national strategies.
> 9.	Deploy market-shaping policies and tools to unlock private finance. To this end, it is helpful to spur innovation leveraging investor expertise and fostering cross-sector, multidisciplinary collaboration, for example via existing and emerging country platforms.
> a.	Deploy pull finance mechanisms, which lever market-based, results-driven incentives to reward successful solutions rather than funding upfront. Some have been proven in the mitigation space demonstrating strong potential to drive resilience investment:
> i.	Advance market commitments, where public entities guarantee future purchases of resilience solutions (e.g., heat-resilient materials or cooling systems), can be powerful tools in contexts where conventional options are lacking or unaffordable. This can ensure scalable access to proven resilience technologies.
> ii.	Public-private risk sharing mechanisms such as guarantee schemes, can reduce investment risk and attract private capital into resilience projects. By sharing early-stage or systemic risks, governments and development partners can unlock innovation and scale in otherwise underserved areas. 
> iii.	Outcome-based contracts, where governments or donors pay for verified resilience outcomes (e.g., reduced heat-related hospitalizations), can incentivize effective adaptation. Structured long-term contracts tied to results such as avoided disasters (e.g., floods) have been tested in the US. and help create investable, cash-flow-generating adaptation projects. 
> b.	Support pilots for innovative resilience finance instruments. Governments and regulators can engage with and provide platforms to test emerging tools such as Contingent Resilience-Linked (CORL) Bonds , and Sovereign Climate-Contingent Convertible Bonds (S-CloCo)  . 
> 10.	Review prudential regulations to unlock climate resilience investment. Governments and regulators can reassess capital adequacy rules—such as those under Basel III—to better reflect climate-related risks and reduce the cost of capital for infrastructure in emerging markets. Outdated prudential frameworks may unintentionally discourage climate-resilience investment.  In parallel, fiduciary duty frameworks governing investment advisers, pension fund trustees, and asset managers must evolve to incorporate long-term systemic climate risks. Integrating climate risk into fiduciary responsibilities ensures that institutional investors are empowered to fund adaptation projects that reduce future risk, aligning financial regulation with resilience goals and mitigating the cost of inaction. 
> 11.	Support pre-arranged financing tools particularly in emerging markets and vulnerable economies. These instruments provide rapid access to funds following climate shocks, helping countries preserve fiscal space and respond effectively to disasters.
> a.	Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS), such as catastrophe bonds (CAT-Bonds), transfer disaster risk to capital markets. Governments can promote ILS Resilience Bonds, which release funds for recovery when predefined events (e.g., hurricanes) occur, reducing fiscal pressure.
> b.	Contingent Credit Lines and Guarantee Facilities offer pre-approved financing—such as the World Bank’s Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO)—that can be quickly disbursed after a disaster.
> c.	Parametric Insurance triggers payouts based on measurable parameters (e.g., wind speed, rainfall), enabling faster and more predictable funding than traditional loss-based insurance.

> Box [4] - Initiatives advancing the enabling conditions for climate adaptation investment
> 
> Several initiatives across the UK and EU are working to create enabling environments for climate adaptation investment, with a shared focus on mobilising finance, supporting local authorities, and overcoming barriers to resilience planning and implementation.
> 
> •	ATTENUATE (UK): A collaborative project led by the Grantham Research Institute, aiming to unlock private finance for adaptation by generating economic evidence, improving public sector investment strategies, and addressing behavioural and governance barriers.

> 
> Despite growing awareness of physical climate risks in sovereign credit assessments, the economic benefits of national adaptation efforts remain undervalued, leading to mispricing and underinvestment in A&R, particularly in the most climate-exposed economies.. 
> Stakeholders are at varying stages of integration of A&R efforts into their sovereign credit risk analysis, with some financial institutions beginning to consider sovereign-level adaptation strategies into their assessments, while most stakeholders continue to prioritise physical climate risk mitigation. A&R investments are critical for strengthening national capacity to manage climate impacts by reducing sensitivity and enhancing adaptive capacity, as exposure to climate hazards increases. Demonstrating the advantages of sovereign adaptation investment, especially in mitigating the worsening of physical climate risk in sovereign credit rating assessments, is a key opportunity.
> A&R investments offer a win-win for financial institutions: they expand lending and investable opportunities while enhancing the creditworthiness of recipient countries and the business within them, by reducing climate-related fiscal risks. By contrast, a narrow focus in minimising short term risk exposure, will exacerbate vulnerabilities in the system.
> Assessing adaptive capacity requires tailored, context-specific tools, as adaptation is dynamic, highly context-specific, and cannot be captured by a single metric. While data limitations persist, a growing suite of publicly available benchmarks and portals (many adapted from disaster risk frameworks) are helping stakeholders evaluate resilience and guide targeted investment and policy decisions.
> Encouragingly, progress in data availability and quality, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the growing sophistication of climate risk analysis is deepening our understanding of adaptive capacity and enabling more informed, forward-looking decision-making. These advances, alongside emerging taxonomies and subnational initiatives, are unlocking capital for resilience and building momentum for adaptation-focused financial instruments across sovereign and corporate markets.
> To unlock further public and private investment in climate adaptation and resilience, critical for strengthening sovereign and corporate credit profiles, governments and regulators must improve climate risk information and disclosure, clarify resilience investment definitions, and support long-term planning and adaptation indicators. At the same time, smart regulation, targeted fiscal incentives, and market-shaping tools such as outcome-based contracts and risk-sharing mechanisms can strengthen the financial case for near-term investment. Reviewing prudential frameworks and supporting innovative finance instruments will further enable capital mobilisation, especially in vulnerable economies, aligning financial systems with long-term resilience goals.
> Areas for further research 
> To effectively integrate climate adaptation and resilience into financial and sovereign risk assessments, governments and institutions need better data and analytical tools. A key starting point is quantifying the costs and benefits of adaptation, as highlighted in recent research by WRI . This helps build the investment case for resilience and enables more rigorous economic analysis. However, it's equally important to track actual progress on adaptation, beyond stated intentions in national plans. Without clear visibility into what countries are implementing on the ground, it's difficult for credit ratings and investors to reflect the true value of adaptation efforts.
> In parallel, there is growing recognition of the need to incorporate climate risk into debt sustainability analyses. Emerging approaches—such as those using the IMF’s DIGNAD model —are beginning to account for physical climate risks in sovereign debt assessments. Additionally, global models often lack the geographic and economic specificity needed for country-level insights. Bespoke regional analyses are essential to translate climate risks into fiscal strategy, reflecting diverse geographies, economic structures, and policy priorities. Moreover, emerging research suggests that inflationary impacts from climate shocks—especially in food and energy—may be stronger predictors of social unrest and debt repayment capacity than GDP losses  , highlighting a promising lens for assessing adaptive capacity and guiding resilience investment.

> Certainly! Here's a brief summary:
> 
> The "Deals – Deliverable 3" report examines the impact of physical climate risks and national adaptation efforts on sovereign credit assessments, highlighting a crucial gap in how adaptation measures are recognized financially. While physical climate risks increasingly affect sovereign spreads and credit ratings, especially in vulnerable economies, the benefits of adaptation are inadequately integrated into creditworthiness evaluations. The report underscores the need to address this discrepancy to attract investment for climate resilience, particularly in fiscally constrained countries. The study notes that while some stakeholders are beginning to consider adaptation strategies, short-term analyses often overlook the long-term economic benefits of resilience-building. This mispricing of climate risks and adaptation efforts hampers the capacity of emerging and developing economies to secure necessary investments. Moving forward, improved data, modeling, and communication of adaptation progress are vital to better integrating these considerations into sovereign risk assessments, ensuring financial markets support, rather than penalize, early adaptation actions. The paper by Klusak et al. (2023) is referenced as a study showing potential future downgrades due to projected climate change impacts.
