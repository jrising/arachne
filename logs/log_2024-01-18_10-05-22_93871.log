**user**:
> In xarray, how do I sum over a particular dimension?
**assistant**:
> In xarray, you can sum over a specific dimension using the `sum()` method. Here is a quick example where we sum over the `'time'` dimension:
> 
> ```python
> import xarray as xr
> 
> # suppose 'ds' is your xarray Dataset or DataArray
> # For summing over 'time' dimension:
> 
> summation = ds.sum(dim='time')
> ```
> 
> In this example, `ds` could be your Dataset or DataArray, and `'time'` should be replaced by the name of the dimension that you want to sum over. The method `sum()` takes the dimension name as a string and sums over that dimension.
> 
> This will return a new Dataset or DataArray with the specified dimension removed because those values have been summed up.
> 
> Remember to replace `'time'` with your desired dimension.
