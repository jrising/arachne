**user**:
> For my department's yearly appraisal process, I am to fill out a form with a bunch of questions. Most of these seem fairly straightforward, but for each major section (Research, Teaching, Service), there is a subsection titled "Community engagement, equity and inclusion statement:". What should I put in here?
**assistant**:
> The "Community engagement, equity and inclusion statement" sections are areas for you to discuss your efforts related to engaging with diverse communities, promoting equity, and fostering an inclusive environment in each of the major areas of your professional responsibilities (i.e. Research, Teaching, Service). 
> 
> Here are some suggestions on how you might approach each statement:
> 
> ## Research:
> In this section, you could highlight any research projects or initiatives that examine or support underrepresented or marginalized communities. If your research methodology includes measures to ensure diversity and inclusion, be sure to mention them here. Also, consider discussing collaborations with community partners, efforts to make your research accessible to non-academic audiences, or other ways in which your work is relevant to broader societal challenges or benefits diverse populations.
> 
> ## Teaching:
> 
> Discuss the strategies and practices you have adopted to ensure inclusivity in your classroom. This could include designing course content that reflects diverse perspectives, using pedagogical approaches that cater to different learning styles, establishing a classroom culture where all voices are heard, and providing individualized supports to students from diverse backgrounds. If you have undertaken any professional development in the area of equitable and inclusive teaching, be sure to mention it.
> 
> ## Service:
> 
> Speak about any service work you've done that promotes social justice, diversity, and inclusion in your department, within the university, or the broader academic community. This could involve fostering open dialogue around these issues, mentoring students or early career researchers from underrepresented groups, serving on diversity and inclusion committees, or organizing events or workshops that enhance understanding of equity-related issues. 
> 
> Remember, the key focus of these statements is to demonstrate your active engagement and commitment to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of your academic work. In addition, it would be ideal to provide specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate your contributions. Make sure to also reflect on the impact and future directions of your efforts.
