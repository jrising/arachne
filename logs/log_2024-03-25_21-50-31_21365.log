> I have an aggregated MRIO matrix, consisting of a matrix of intermediate inputs Z (N country rows x N country columns), a matrix of final demand Y (also NxN, where the entry at row i column j says how country i's outputs feed country j's final demand), and a vector of value added + raw inputs v. First, how can I calculate GDP from such a table?
**assistant**:
> In the context of an aggregated Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) table, calculating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) requires adding together the value-added component and the sum of the final demand components for each country. Here are step-by-step instructions:
> 
> 1. Compute the total value added for each country i by summing up all the value added for this country. This vector `V` would be N x 1, where N is the number of countries.
>     ```
>     V = sum(v[:, i]) for i in 1:size(v, 2)
>     ```
> 2. Compute the total demand for each country's outputs that are used for final demand j in the other country (domestic or abroad). This matrix `D` would be N x N. 
>     ```
>     D = sum(Y[i, :]) for i in 1:size(Y, 1)
>     ```
> 3. Compute the GDP for each country as the sum of values from `V` and `D`. This results in a GDP vector `G` which is N x 1.
>     ```
>     G = V .+ sum(D, dims=2)
>     ```

> Note: The code provided is in Julia language. The operations `for`, `sum` could be used as is for Python, R, and many other languages. The `.` before the `+` in the third step signifies element-wise addition in Julia and Python (for Python, numpy library should be used). If you're using a different language, you might need to use a different syntax for element-wise addition.

**user**:
> Great. Now, I would like to produce a "shock" upon each country's GDP. How can I find out how that affects all other countries' GDPs, accounting for direct and indirect effects?
**assistant**:
> To assess how a shock to one country's GDP affects all other countries' GDPs, including both direct and indirect effects through the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework, you would typically perform a scenario analysis using a method like the multiplier analysis. Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow:
> 
> 1. **Introducing a Shock**:
>    - Apply a shock to the GDP of the country you are interested in studying. This shock could represent an increase or decrease in GDP due to a specific event or policy change.
> 
> 2. **Calculate Multipliers**:
>    - For each country in the MRIO table, calculate the direct and indirect effects multipliers. The direct effect would be the initial impact of the shock on the country itself, while the indirect effects capture the impact on other countries through supply chain linkages.
> 
> 3. **Multiply Shock by Multipliers**:
>    - Multiply the shock applied to the initial country's GDP by the direct and indirect effects multipliers for each country in the MRIO table. This will give you an estimate of how the shock ripples through the entire system.
> 
> 4. **Aggregate Results**:
>    - Sum up the effects across all countries to see the total impact of the shock on the global GDP and how it spreads across different regions.
> 
> 5. **Interpretation**:
>    - Analyze the results to understand which countries are most sensitive to the shock, how the effects propagate through the global economy, and any patterns or dependencies that emerge.
> 
> By following these steps, you can gain insights into the interconnectedness of different economies through the MRIO framework and understand the spillover effects of shocks in a global context. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with any specific calculations!
**user**:
> How can I get the MRIO multipliers from IO matrices?
**assistant**:
> To calculate the Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) multipliers from Input-Output (IO) matrices, you can follow these general steps:
> 
> 1. **Constructing the MRIO Leontief Inverse**:
>    - The Leontief Inverse (L) captures the interdependencies of sectors within an economy. To extend this concept to a multi-region context, you will need to construct a MRIO Leontief Inverse specific to your aggregated MRIO table.
> 
> 2. **Calculating MRIO Multipliers**:
>    - Once you have the MRIO Leontief Inverse matrix, you can derive the MRIO multipliers using the following formula:
>    ```
>    M = (I - A)^(-1)
>    ```
>    where:
>      - M is the matrix of MRIO multipliers.
>      - I is the identity matrix.
>      - A is the MRIO Leontief Inverse matrix.
> 
> 3. **Interpreting the Results**:
>    - The MRIO multipliers represent the total impact on the entire system resulting from a one-unit increase in the final demand of each sector in every region. Larger multiplier values indicate a greater interdependence and influence of that sector/region on the overall economy.
> 
> 4. **Applying the Multipliers**:
>    - Once you have derived the multipliers, you can use them to analyze the indirect effects of changes in final demand or value-added components on GDP, employment, and other economic indicators across regions.
> 
> It's important to ensure that your IO matrices are properly aggregated and structured to reflect the multi-regional nature of the analysis. The process may vary depending on the specific structure of your MRIO data and the software tools you are using for calculations.

**user**:
> As I understand it, this multiplier matrix will tell me about how total output is affected:
> x = (I - T)^{-1} f
> But is that the same as how value added or final demand are affected?
**assistant**:
> The formula you provided, \( x = (I - T)^{-1} f \), indeed captures the total output multiplier effects within an Input-Output (IO) framework, where:
> 
> - \( x \) represents the total output multiplier vector,
> - \( I \) is the identity matrix,
> - \( T \) is the Leontief Inverse matrix, and
> - \( f \) denotes the final demand vector.
> 
> However, this total output multiplier matrix does not directly provide insights into how value-added or final demand components are affected. To analyze the impacts on value added or final demand specifically, you would need to adjust the formula accordingly.
> 
> To assess the impacts on value added or final demand, you can consider the following:
> 
> 1. **Value-Added Impact**:
>    - To analyze the effects on value added, you can utilize the Leontief Inverse matrix ( \( T \) ) to calculate the value-added multiplier matrix. The value-added multiplier matrix can be obtained by:
>    \[ v = T \cdot (I - T)^{-1} \cdot f \]
>    where \( v \) is the vector of value-added multipliers.
> 
> 2. **Final Demand Impact**:
>    - Similarly, to assess the impacts on final demand, you can calculate the final demand multiplier matrix by:
>    \[ d = (I - T)^{-1} \cdot f \]
>    where \( d \) denotes the vector of final demand multipliers.
> 
> By computing these additional multiplier matrices, you can gain insights into how changes in final demand or value added propagate through the economy, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the interconnected effects within the system.

**user**:
> Can you show the derivation of the value-added multiplier matrix and the final demand multiplier matrix?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! I can guide you through the derivation of the value-added multiplier matrix and the final demand multiplier matrix within an Input-Output (IO) framework:

> - Identity matrix: \( I \),
> - Final demand vector: \( f \).
> 
> The value-added multiplier matrix \( v \) can be derived as follows:
> 
> 1. **Value-Added Impact Formula**:
>    The impact on value added can be calculated using the formula:
>    \[ v = T \cdot (I - T)^{-1} \cdot f \]
> 
> 2. **Derivation**:
>    - We start by expressing the total output in terms of direct effects and value added:
>      \[ x = (I - T)^{-1} \cdot f \]
>    - The total output can also be expressed as the sum of value added and intermediate inputs:
>      \[ x = v + f \]
>    - Therefore, the value-added vector can be obtained as:
>      \[ v = x - f \]
> 
> 3. **Substitute and Solve**:
>    - Substitute the expression for \( x \) into the equation:
>      \[ v = (I - T)^{-1} \cdot f - f \]
>    - Simplify the equation to obtain the value-added multiplier matrix \( v \).
> 
> ### Derivation of the Final Demand Multiplier Matrix:
> 
> Given:
> - Leontief Inverse matrix: \( T \),
> - Identity matrix: \( I \),
> - Final demand vector: \( f \).
> 
> The final demand multiplier matrix \( d \) can be derived as follows:
> 
> 1. **Final Demand Impact Formula**:
>    The impact on final demand can be calculated using the formula:
>    \[ d = (I - T)^{-1} \cdot f \]
> 
> 2. **Derivation**:
>    - The total output is the sum of value added and final demand:
>      \[ x = v + f \]
>    - Since the total output is also expressed in terms of the Leontief Inverse and final demand:
>      \[ x = (I - T)^{-1} \cdot f \]
>    - Equate the two expressions for \( x \) and solve for the final demand multiplier vector \( d \).
> 
> By following these derivations, you can obtain the value-added multiplier matrix and the final demand multiplier matrix to analyze the impacts of changes in value added and final demand within the IO framework.
