> I am filling out a section of the "Statement of Project Objectives" (SOPO) document required for a grant proposal to DOE. The project is "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)". My additions relate to the community benefits plan (CBP). Here is the concept note for the CBP:
> 
> ---
> The EMPOWER Community Benefits Plan focuses effort on two primary audiences: the offshore wind workforce and the coastal stakeholder communities. EMPOWER will engage these audiences by (1) integrating diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and accessibility; (2) contributing to energy equity and environmental justice; and (3) investing in America’s workforce.  
> 
> # Welcoming and Inclusive Environment 
> 
> EMPOWER will develop and implement equitable opportunities with clear decision-making procedures and a code of conduct. Our primary goal is to create a safe and supportive environment that fosters equitable opportunities for every team member in project activities. With a strong emphasis on open communication, we are committed to promoting the exchange of diverse perspectives and ideas. Scholarship and Mentorship: EMPOWER will develop and implement fellowship, scholarship and mentorship programs to promote equity in access and opportunities in offshore wind. The programs will leverage existing partnerships and activities among our partners, build new ones where there are gaps and will engage underserved communities to provide training and educational opportunities in offshore wind research and workforce training. We will direct our recruitment efforts to venues such as the SACNAS conference and engage community college networks, HBCUs, and Tribal Colleges, along with Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Industries (WRISE). Public Information Session and Community Advisory Board: The Consortium will engage and collaborate with coastal communities who are stakeholders in or directly affected by offshore wind projects by establishing relationships to address community concerns. Centered on the principle of co-creation and co-design, it will ensure community perspectives and priorities are integrated into EMPOWER decision-making by conducting public information sessions and forming a diverse community advisory board. Local residents, businesses, environmental organizations, and Tribal Nations will be engaged regularly to identify and prioritize community benefits that can be derived from the activities of the consortium. The community advisory board will meet at least two times a year to provide input, feedback, and recommendations and board members will be paid an honorarium consistent with best practices.   
> 
> The Mid-Atlantic region has a resident workforce with many of the skills needed to attract offshore wind manufacturers and developers. However, the scale and offshore location of the technology will require some workers to have industry-specific training. EMPOWER can help address this challenge by coordinating directly with the local workforce via the municipal economic development agencies and each state's higher education, technical and community colleges, workforce experts, industry experts, and other state agencies to expand activities such as vocational and union training, training facilities, certification programs, experiential learning opportunities, and curriculum development.
> 
> # Energy Equity 
> 
> EMPOWER will endeavor to address the disproportionate burdens that may be imposed on environmental justice (EJ) communities from offshore wind energy decisions and policies. We will take actions to address energy injustice and advance the just and fair siting, development, and governance of offshore wind energy systems. Equitable access to offshore wind benefits: EMPOWER will establish partnerships with local businesses and organizations to maximize procurement opportunities and subcontracting for minority-owned, women-owned, and disadvantaged enterprises, consistent with the philosophy of Justice40. The workforce training program will prioritize individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds or communities. Environmental justice and mitigation: EMPOWER will conduct environmental impact studies to identify any environmental justice concerns that our projects or those of our collaborating partners may create and develop mitigation plans accordingly. EMPOWER will draw together the expertise needed to effectively address environmental justice concerns in OSW energy siting, development, and governance. Building on our Public Information Sessions, we will initiate a public comment process, synthesizing an ongoing stream of comments to inform our stakeholders and our work. Educational outreach: We will empower individuals and communities to participate in offshore wind energy by increasing awareness, understanding, and participation of minority communities. Educational materials, workshops, and online resources will be developed to explain the benefits and impacts of offshore wind energy in accessible and culturally sensitive styles. Community fairs, renewable energy tours, and information sessions will be organized in collaboration with public schools, colleges, and community organizations to integrate offshore wind topics into educational curricula and career programs.

> # Invest in America’s Workforce 
> 
> Investing in America’s workforce is crucial for economic growth, competitiveness, and energy independence. By training American workers with offshore wind energy skills, the United States will be positioned as a global leader in offshore wind energy. EMPOWER will work to maximize the economic benefits of offshore wind energy by cultivating America’s existing and future workforce. In 2022, the Responsible Offshore Wind Alliance (RODA) prepared a research action plan that outlined the OSW concerns of the fishing industry. As it pertains to the existing American workforce, RODA identified that offshore wind energy might be seen as a benefit to fishermen as they diversify their work by assisting with offshore wind projects, however there might also be a loss or displacement of employment as experienced crew and their respective support services shift to offshore wind energy operations. EMPOWER will engage these communities to identify opportunities to sustain this important coastal workforce as offshore wind develops in the U.S. American Supply Chain: EMPOWER will play a supportive role through research and workforce training to encourage the localization of the supply chain and thus promote the growth of American businesses and reduce reliance on imports from abroad. In the offshore wind events that the consortium will organize, partnerships between offshore wind developers and the American supply chain will be facilitated to enhance the participation of American small and medium-sized companies in the supply chain. Skilled American Workforce: The workforce development and training programs will focus on upskilling/reskilling American workers for the specific needs of the offshore wind industry. During our 6-month design phase, we will use skill mappings and economic modeling to identify jobs lost and gained across the Mid-Atlantic, considering both the justice implications of these changes and re-skilling needs that allow us to inform the AWE programs. During the implementation period, we will integrate the comprehensive K12 educational programing at partner institutions like the Blue Heron Bowl and Kid Wind hosted by ECU CSI since 2015 and 2013 respectively, that focus on engaging students from underserved regional communities. The New Jersey Offshore Wind Bootcamp Training program at NJIT can effectively and efficiently provide initial training for engineers to make transition from traditional power trades to the offshore wind industry while the OSW Skills Academy and the Wind Power Graduate Certificate at UD can help train the professional workforce. American Research and Development: EMPOWER will partner with strong existing partnerships with the U.S. National Laboratories that already include joint faculty appointments and American companies to leverage American expertise and resources to nurture talents that can accelerate the development and deployment of cutting-edge offshore wind solutions for America. The knowledge developed by EMPOWER will be shared with the American OSW industry to enhance technical capabilities and elevate America’s leadership in offshore wind. EMPOWER will devise metrics to measure and track its performance, and at least once a year, reflect on and assess weaknesses, progress, and opportunities.

> First, please provide two objectives (one for each budget period) for the Project Objectives section. Here is additional guidance from DOE:
> Provide a clear and concise (high-level) statement of the goals and objectives of the project as well as the expected outcomes.  If the award is to be structured in Budget Periods, include the objective(s) for each Budget Period. 
> 
> Here are the existing objectives from other teams:
> ---
> Budget Period 1:  
> 
> Objective 1: To create the Academy of Wind Energy (AWE), a nation-wide consortium of EMPOWER universities that offer courses in wind energy and agree to share such courses among the consortium universities. Similar multi-university initiatives are: the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium (IUDC, https://gsas.nyu.edu/academics/inter-university-doctoral-consortium.html), the four-university European Wind Energy Master (for engineering only, https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ewem), the three-university Wind-U graduate certificate (https://www.depts.ttu.edu/elearning/windu/), and the seven Claremont Colleges (https://www.claremont.edu). The AWE is an administrative entity that gives no degrees but facilitates and supports modern and inter-disciplinary education in wind energy at graduate and undergraduate levels, with particular focus on M.S. education.   
> 
>   
> 
> Objective 2: Establishment of State-Level Consortia: The primary objective of this period is to identify and establish local consortia within each State that have expertise and interest in offshore wind energy research. This involves reaching out to potential partners, forming collaborations, and defining the roles and responsibilities of each consortia. This innovative approach serves three critical functions: acting as an advisory board, facilitating external internships, and engaging industrial partners in the offshore wind development process. During this period, the focus is on creating the meta-consortium framework, which brings together the individual State-level consortia. The objective is to design a collaborative structure that fosters inter-consortia communication, resource sharing, and joint goal-setting. This consortia will include representatives from each State-level consortium to form the advisory board of the meta-consortium. This board will provide guidance and expertise to shape the research activities and strategic direction of the Center of Excellence.

>   
> 
> Objective 3: (TEAM 4) 
> 
>  
> 
> Budget Period 2:  
> 
> Objective 4 - Implement AWE: AWE will 1) prepare innovative and multi-disciplinary curricula for the AWE M.S. in Wind Energy, with at least three concentrations (Offshore Wind, Wind Energy Engineering, and Wind Energy Policy; 2) provide additional learning, research, and professional experiences for Ph.D. students in wind energy at EMPOWER institutions, leveraging existing institutional resources; and 3) enable undergraduate (UG) students at EMPOWER institutions to learn about relevant topics in wind energy, including environment, grid integration, and equity issues (the three blades) by granting them access to some of the shared AWE courses as technical electives. The AWE M.S. in Wind Energy includes a common set of introductory inter-disciplinary courses, core courses (including new courses that incorporate the EMPOWER three-blade topics), transferable skill courses (e.g., communication), and experiential learning opportunities (e.g., internships). The AWE courses will be delivered both online (synchronously) and in-person, allowing students the flexibility to select courses taught at any partner college or university. 
> 
>   
> 
> Objective 5 - Implement the meta -consortium: The consortium will 1) promote collaborative research initiatives among the State-level consortia within the meta-consortium. This involves identifying research areas of common interest, facilitating knowledge exchange, and fostering joint projects; 2) Integrate the academy of wind energy training programs with the meta-consortium's activities, ensuring that workforce training aligns with the research goals and industry needs, providing students with relevant skills and knowledge; and 3) expand the network of stakeholders, leverage additional resources, and foster real-world applications of the research findings.

> Objective 6 – TEAM 4 
> 
>  
> 
> Objective 7 – Sustain EMPOWER programming beyond DOE investment: The team’s vision is that EMPOWER will attract further membership and sponsorship from industry, government, and philanthropic sources, ultimately allowing EMPOWER to be a self-sustained asset supporting the DOE. We will identify and execute mechanisms for AWE to self-sustain financially in the long term, if its existence past this award is deemed valuable after due assessment.  For example, we can engage our meta-consortium to establish a research grant scheme, akin to the "Power Systems Engineering Research Center." This consortium will collect membership fees from participating companies within the meta-consortium. The funds will be utilized to create a research grant scheme that allows universities and research institutions to apply for funding to work on problems and challenges proposed by industry partners in the offshore wind sector.

> Can you provide text for the two missing objectives (Objective 3 and Objective 6)?
**assistant**:
> Sure! I've crafted two objectives for Objective 3 and Objective 6 that follow the spirit and structure of the existing objectives and focus on the development of the Community Benefits Plan and its implementation:
> 
> **Budget Period 1**
> Objective 3: Develop EMPOWER's Strategic Community Benefits Plan: The primary goal for this period is to draft a comprehensive and strategic Community Benefits Plan (CBP) that underscores our commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion, environmental justice, and workforce development. By working closely with key stakeholders, we aim to establish clear objectives and strategies that ensure offshore wind energy benefits are shared equitably. This will involve identifying potential partnerships with communities, educational institutions, and organizations and designing outreach and educational initiatives to enhance the pipeline of talent into offshore wind and foster inclusiveness across the sector. Through this objective, we intend to integrate our project activities with wider societal benefits and enhance communication with various stakeholders.
> 
> **Budget Period 2**
> Objective 6 - Implement, Monitor, and Refine the CBP: With the CBP firmly established, our focus will shift to the implementation phase, striving to 1) mobilize our various programs designed to cultivate a skilled and diverse workforce ready for offshore wind opportunities; 2) foster strong, collaborative relationships with communities, and establish a two-way communication channel for capturing feedback and continuously refining our approach; 3) conduct environmental impact studies to ensure the sustainable and equitable development of offshore wind projects; and 4) introduce measures to assess the performance of our CBP, allowing us to track progress and adjust our strategies to maximize community benefits. Our work this period will be dedicated to keeping the scores of wind energy stakeholders informed, engaged, and involved, ensuring that our advances in sustainable energy are simultaneously advances in sustainable and inclusive communities.
**user**:
> For Objective 3, I feel like the top part is too unformed. We will already have a CBP. The design phase should focus on better understanding exactly how we will implement it (and the discussion should be more concrete than "we will understand how to implement the CBP).
> 
> For Objective 6, Can you remove the text about "shifting to the implementation phase"? Also the last sentence suggests that we are just communicating with stakeholders, when in fact we will also be helping vulnerable communities become part of the renewable economy.
> 
> Can you adjust these objectives accordingly?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are the adjusted objectives for Objective 3 and Objective 6:
> 
> **Budget Period 1**
> 
> Objective 3: Design a Robust Implementation Strategy for the Community Benefits Plan (CBP): During this period, our focus will be on refining and solidifying the implementation strategy for the CBP. Building upon the initial development of the CBP, we will engage with key stakeholders and community partners to deepen our understanding of their specific needs and aspirations. Through comprehensive research and collaborative discussions, we will identify targeted actions, programs, and partnerships that promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental justice within the offshore wind industry. Our objective is to establish a well-defined and concrete roadmap for the effective implementation of the CBP, ensuring that it has a tangible and positive impact on the workforce, coastal stakeholder communities, and the wider region.
> 
> **Budget Period 2**
> 
> Objective 6: Continuously Improve and Enhance the CBP Impact: Building upon the foundation of the implemented CBP, our objective in this period is to continuously monitor, measure, and enhance the impact of our community benefits initiatives. Through ongoing collaboration with vulnerable and underserved communities, we will go beyond mere communication and actively support and empower these communities to become active participants in the renewable economy. By identifying and addressing barriers, we will work towards the goal of fostering equity, economic opportunity, and sustainability. We will regularly assess the effectiveness of our programs and strategies, seeking feedback from stakeholders and making necessary adjustments to optimize outcomes. Our commitment is to ensure that the CBP delivers tangible benefits and serves as a catalyst for positive social change within the offshore wind industry and the wider community.
