> I'm trying to make a fun drink for a kid's party. I have lemonade, but I also have a smoothie maker and frozen fruit, and the kids love that. I'm wondering if I can premake the smoothie stuff, or make some kind of lemonade smoothie mix.
**assistant**:
> That sounds like a fun idea! Combining lemonade with a smoothie can make a refreshing and fruity drink that kids will love. Hereâ€™s a simple recipe for a Lemonade Smoothie Mix that you can premake and serve at the party:
> 
> ### Lemonade Smoothie Mix Recipe
> 
> #### Ingredients:
> - 2 cups of lemonade
> - 1 cup frozen strawberries
> - 1 cup frozen blueberries
> - 1 cup frozen pineapple chunks
> - 1 banana (optional, for added creaminess)
> - 1 cup of ice
> 
> #### Instructions:
> 1. **Prepare the Smoothie Base:** In your smoothie maker, blend the frozen strawberries, blueberries, pineapple chunks, and the banana until they are well combined.
> 2. **Add Lemonade:** Pour the lemonade into the blender with the mixed fruits. Blend until the mixture is smooth. The lemonade will add a nice tangy flavor to the smoothie.
> 3. **Add Ice:** Add the ice to the blender and blend again until the mixture is smooth and has a slushy consistency.
> 4. **Storage:** Pour the mixture into a sealable container and keep it in the freezer until you are ready to serve it. 
> 
> #### Serving:
> - **Before Serving:** Take the mixture out of the freezer about 10-15 minutes before serving to let it soften enough to be pourable.
> - **Cup Prep:** You could also do a fun rim on the cups with some sugar or colorful sprinkles. Lightly moisten the rims of the cups with water or a little lemonade and dip the rims into sugar or sprinkles for a festive touch.
> 
> #### Tips:
> - **Customization:** Feel free to adjust the fruit ratios based on what you have or what your kids like the most.
> - **Garnishes:** Add fun garnishes like colorful straws, umbrella picks, or fruit slices on the rim of the cup.
> 
> This Lemonade Smoothie Mix is easy to make ahead of time and will be a big hit with the kids at the party! Enjoy!
**user**:
> Can I make it the night before and keep it in the fridge?
**assistant**:
> While the Lemonade Smoothie Mix is best served fresh, you can make it the night before and store it in the refrigerator. However, keep in mind that the texture may change slightly as it sits in the fridge overnight. The mixture may become a bit more solid due to the frozen fruit and ice. 
> 
> Here are some tips to ensure the best results if you decide to make it the night before:
> 
> 1. **Storage:** Transfer the prepared Lemonade Smoothie Mix into an airtight container or pitcher before placing it in the refrigerator. This will help prevent the mix from absorbing other odors in the fridge.
>    
> 2. **Thawing:** When you're ready to serve the smoothie mix, take it out of the fridge a bit before serving to allow it to soften slightly. You may need to stir or blend it again to restore the desired consistency.
> 
> 3. **Adjustments:** You may need to tweak the texture by adding a little more lemonade or ice and giving it a good blend before serving to achieve the desired consistency.
> 
> By following these tips, you can still enjoy a tasty and refreshing Lemonade Smoothie the next day, even if the texture may be a bit different from when freshly made. Enjoy the party!
