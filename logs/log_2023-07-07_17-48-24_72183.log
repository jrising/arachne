> I am preparing my external dossier for tenure review, and I would like edits to improve the text as well as the identification of any gaps. I will provide the sections of this one-at-a-time. This is a section of my Service Statement.
> 
> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."

> Second, here is a peer's statement for comparison:
> ---
> Statement of Contributions to Diversity Equity and Inclusion
> Since completing my PhD (September 2015), I have taken the following steps to improve diversity,
> equity, and inclusion at UC Davis and within environmental economics. (Activities during the merit
> review period are marked with a *):
> • I was the first instructor for the Environmental Justice Speaker Series (Spring 2018). This was the
> first dedicated class on environmental justice in the Environmental Science and Policy
> Department and had an enrollment of 94 with an additional 9 in an in-depth discussion section. I
> invited a diverse group of speakers, from within and outside of academia, to campus. I
> facilitated opportunities for students to interact with speakers by hosting post-talk dinners and
> inviting student groups (such as EJUC and the Black Student Union) for meetings with speakers
> while on campus.
> • I revised curricula in both ESP 168a and ENV 200b to incorporate material on the racial and class
> determinants of exposure to pollution, and the nature, origins, and consequences of the racial
> wealth gap in the United States. I developed problem set exercises in both ESP 168a and ESP
> 106* that use data behind the EPA’s EJSCREEN tool to allow students to explore the
> demographic and economic correlates of pollution exposure in the US.
> • I co-designed a new class (ESP 106) which is intended as a fully-accessible introduction to coding
> and data-science for students interested in environmental issues with no prior experience.
> Quantitative and data-analytic skills are increasingly required for many jobs and are associated
> with high wage premia. But women and minorities tend to acquire these skills and enter these
> positions at lower rates. This may be because they enter college with less experience than other
> groups and then face barriers to acquiring these skills. This class is designed to address this
> barrier by introducing coding in an accessible and inclusive way, allowing student to develop
> foundational skills they can build on in later classes. In the first offering of the class, about half
> the students entered with no coding experience and successfully finished being able to
> complete simple data analysis and visualization in R. Student comments on evaluations include
> “I gained the confidence that I can try to work with R” and “Programming is not as hard as I
> thought” suggesting the class succeeded in this goal.*
> • I completed the Center for Education Effectiveness’ ACCELERATE Fellows Program to learn
> strategies for inclusive and accessible instruction in 2020. I substantially revised assessments for
> ESP 168a to incorporate more formative assessments following this program.*
> • I am a Faculty Ally for the student-led Diversity Committee within the Environmental Policy and
> Management program*
> • I am participating as a mentor in the inaugural year of the Association for Environmental
> Resource and Economists (AERE) Scholars Program. This is a mentoring program that matches
> environmental and resource economics faculty with more junior mentees in the field, designed
> to increase diversity in the profession. It also includes training and workshop sessions for
> 
> mentors on best-practice for inclusive mentoring. This began in June 2020 and is ongoing. I am
> meeting monthly with my mentee and every 3 months with other mentors.*
> • I have made myself available for mentoring meetings, advertised publicly via Twitter, at both the
> Allied Social Sciences Association meeting in 2020 and the 2021 AERE Summer Conference. This
> resulted in three one-on-one mentoring meetings with more junior women of color in
> environmental economics.*

> Cultural and racial diversity, gender equality, and a diversity of

> living in both the rural and urban worlds and traveling extensively, I

> I place a high value on cultural and racial diversity, gender equality, and the broad range of backgrounds among our academic family. Through my rural and urban living experiences and extensive travels, I've witnessed firsthand the indomitable way diversity bolsters the intellectual vigor and character of academic communities.
> 
> However, being a part of male-dominated fields also exposed me to the palpable deficit of gender equality. This imbalance not only mutes critical academic voices but also fuels the potential for harassment. To upend this status quo, I actively advocate for gender parity and support for LGBTQ+ individuals within academic circles, a resolve that has manifested distinctly in my service across former and current institutions.
> 
> As a crucial component of the seminar series at the London School of Economics and the University of Delaware, I prioritized maintaining an equal gender ratio and ensuring robust international representation. This conscious decision stemmed from my belief in the strength of diversity and was echoed in my research partnerships, which frequently span the globe.
> 
> For instance, I've co-organized international workshops focusing on climate risks. Here, we endeavored to create a rich tapestry of diversity—across backgrounds, regions, and genders—to capture a more holistic understanding of our planet's challenges.
> 
> At the University of Delaware, I was an active participant in Unlearning Racism in Geoscience (URGE). My involvement helped translate our group discussions into concrete actions, catalyzing change within our department’s hiring practices, student resources, and interactions throughout the University.
> 
> Mindful of the importance of these values, I've also endeavored to incorporate diversity within my research groups. My recruitment strategy reflects this commitment. Each of my four PhD students hails from a different country, underscoring my dedication to creating an intellectual space enriched with global perspectives.
