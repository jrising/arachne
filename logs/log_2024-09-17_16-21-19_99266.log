> I'm trying to figure out how to be fair to international prospective students. I get requests of interest, which sometimes turn into requests for pre-submission interviews. Many of these students are from developing countries and the application cost is non-trivial. But I don't want to spend all my time talking with prospective students either. What should I do?

> Balancing fairness to prospective students, particularly those from developing countries, with your time constraints is indeed challenging. Here are a few suggestions:
> 
> 1. **Streamline Initial Communication:**
>    - Create a comprehensive FAQ page or document addressing common queries about your program and the application process. Direct interested students to this resource as a first step.
> 
> 2. **Set Clear Guidelines:**
>    - Clearly outline the criteria and process for pre-submission interviews on your website or in communications. This can help manage expectations and ensure that only the most suitably prepared and serious candidates reach out for interviews.
> 
> 3. **Introduce Preliminary Assessments:**
>    - Consider a short preliminary assessment or questionnaire that prospective students need to fill out. This can help you gauge their preparedness and genuine interest, allowing you to prioritize who gets further engagement.
> 
> 4. **Group Information Sessions:**
>    - Organize group webinars or info sessions for prospective students. This way, many people can learn about your program at once, reducing the need for individual meetings and providing a platform for questions.
> 
> 5. **Pre-Application Workshops:**
>    - Offer workshops specifically designed for students from developing countries. These could cover application processes, expectations, and any financial aid options available, helping to level the playing field.
> 
> 6. **Encourage Early Applications:**
>    - Communicate that early applications are encouraged and might offer a better opportunity for interaction and consideration. This helps stagger your interactions over time.
> 
> 7. **Virtual Office Hours:**
>    - Set aside specific times each week for virtual office hours where students can drop in for short, focused questions. This keeps your schedule predictable and ensures students have access to you.
> 
> 8. **Collaborate with Alumni:**
>    - If possible, involve current students or alumni in these efforts. They can offer insights and even conduct informational interviews, providing a peer perspective to prospective students.
> 
> By implementing these strategies, you'll be better able to manage your time while providing fair and meaningful support to prospective students from diverse backgrounds.
