> What parts of the US government are required to report cost-benefit analysis in their work? I know that the social cost of carbon was an interagency number, but I don't know how much they all would use it.

> In the United States, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a critical tool used by various parts of the government, especially in the context of regulatory policymaking. Here are some key aspects regarding its application:
> 
> 1. **Executive Branch Regulations**: Under Executive Orders 12866 and 13563, federal executive agencies are generally required to conduct CBA for significant regulatory actions. These analyses assess the expected benefits and costs of proposed or finalized regulations.
> 
> 2. **Office of Management and Budget (OMB)**: The OMB oversees the regulatory process for executive agencies and provides guidelines for conducting CBAs through OMB Circular A-4. This includes recommending the use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) when evaluating regulations that impact greenhouse gas emissions.
> 
> 3. **Independent Agencies**: While independent agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are not bound by executive orders in the same way, many still conduct CBAs, and they acknowledge the importance of assessing the economic implications of their decisions.
> 
> 4. **Social Cost of Carbon**: The SCC is an example of a metric used in CBAs to monetize the climate-related costs of carbon emissions. It was developed through an interagency process, led by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon, established under the Obama administration and revisited under subsequent administrations. It helps agencies quantify the benefits of emissions reductions.
> 
> The extent to which different agencies use the social cost of carbon depends on the nature of their work and the particular regulations or policies in question. Generally, any regulatory action potentially affecting carbon emissions might incorporate the SCC to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
> 
> CBA plays a significant role in decision-making across multiple sectors of the government, and it's particularly crucial in crafting policies related to environmental, health, and safety regulations. If you need more specific details or examples, feel free to let me know!
