While our scope was extensive, it was not fully comprehensive, and some datasets included in the tables could not be evaluated in terms of their resolution and update frequency.

Stakeholders often have useful insights on emerging sources of data, but our stakeholder interview process was very limited.

> Certainly! Here is some draft text to fill in the bullet points and expand on the discussion section:
> 
> 1. **Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and Broader Challenges:**
> 
>    The findings from Delaware highlight several challenges that are universal to marine spatial planning across the globe. Key among these challenges is the disparity in the quality and availability of data necessary for informed decision-making. Regions often face issues related to the high cost and technical difficulties of collecting marine data, impacting the ability to develop comprehensive management plans. Similar to Delaware, many areas experience a disconnection between the different types of data required—from ecological metrics to human activity patterns—making holistic planning difficult.
> 
>    Addressing these data gaps provides an opportunity to enhance MSP processes globally. By improving data comprehensiveness and accuracy, planners can better integrate the ecological, economic, and social dimensions crucial to sustainable ocean use. Consistent spatial and temporal data sets allow for effective resource management and conflict resolution between differing marine activities, ultimately leading to more robust and adaptive planning strategies. This integration fosters an environment where marine ecosystems can thrive alongside sustainable economic activities, supporting both conservation and human livelihoods.
> 
> 2. **Broader Impacts:**
> 
>    Identifying and addressing data gaps has significant implications for policy-making and the efficacy of MSP practices. By ensuring comprehensive data coverage, policymakers can anticipate and mitigate conflicts between various marine activities, such as fishing, shipping, and tourism. This proactive approach reduces the potential for resources to become over-utilized or areas to be multi-claimed, leading to more coherent and cooperative usage of marine spaces.
> 
>    The involvement of local communities and stakeholders is paramount in the MSP process. By engaging diverse voices, MSP can account for local needs and values, enhancing the social legitimacy and effectiveness of planning outcomes. Stakeholder involvement also ensures that new data sources and anecdotal insights are incorporated, keeping the planning process dynamic and locally relevant.
> 
>    Ultimately, closing data gaps contributes to healthier marine ecosystems. Comprehensive data supports better monitoring and management practices, preserving biodiversity and ecosystem functions. As marine ecosystems improve, they provide enhanced services—such as carbon sequestration, storm protection, and food resources—that are vital for human well-being. A well-managed marine environment thus represents not only a healthier aquatic world but also a foundation for sustainable economic and social development.
