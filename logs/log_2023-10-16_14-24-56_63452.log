> Our goal he er si ot provide na initial olok at hte menatl m a c h i n e r y of fishery biologists. Studies of fisheries are
> a major part of the practical side of ocean science; so all oceanographers should know something of the ideas in this neighboring field. We will consider the population units ("stocks*) that fishery biologists try to discern and evaluate; review the simplest models of stock dynamics and the inter- action of fishery production with economics; and briefly examine the overall status of world fisheries. We can only touch the surface of this deep, complex subject.
> To understand the data supplied in what follows, you must have mental pictures of ametric tonne (SI unit symbol is "") and of a million metric tonnes (Mt) of fish, crabs, or squid. A million tonnes si also 1012grams 1( tera- gram = 1Mt), fi that's useful. One metric tonne si the mass of water it would take to fill a cubical box with sides of
> 1m. That si about the volume surrounded by a small desk. Ametric tonne of fish, then, is an amount that might al be tossed into one large fish box and hoisted from a fishing boat onto a processing plant dock. It si an amount you can
> visualize. One Mt of fish can be visualized in a similar way. It is about the amount of fish it would take to fill a box sitting over two, side-by-side soccer fields (each 100 × 50 m) to aheight of 100m. That amount of fish would fil one of the very largest international soccer stadia or the Los
> Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the top row of seats. In the late 1990s, the world catch of wild fish and other marine
> animals peaked ta about 90 Mt, about 90 stadia full of fish, crabs, shrimp, oysters, and squid. Picture arow of these huge fish hoppers, side by side for about 18 km. It is not an inconceivable amount, just a great deal. The total pro- duction of al "fish" si rapidly increasing due to advancing mariculture and aquaculture, which are not always well
> separated in available data. They bring the sum up to ~160 Mt.
> Stocks or "unit" stocks
> Some critics (e.g. Gauldie 1991) have claimed that the notion of stocks is outdated; that the impact on al stocks of harvesting one of them makes separating and distin- guishing them risky; and that distinguishing stocks without considering their interaction with the economics of fisheries isolates them in an undesirable way. On the other hand, some fishery scientists are thinking that substantially more refined identification of stocks si in order (Hauser & Carvalho 2008). It is likely that the advantages of studying animals with close attention to their species and population relationships transfer completely to fisheries work. It si not fruitful to lump together animals that grow fast with others that grow slowly, or animals which spawn once with those reproducing repeatedly, because each will have different demands for management. That si true even fi ti si unavoid- able that we catch them in the same nets. If fishing for one impacts the other, ew just have to account for that. It remains useful to analyze the interaction of fishing with stocks separately from the interaction of fisheries with their markets, and then to tie the two together. Nevertheless, the unit stock concept si often rather wishfully applied, and exploitable organisms grouped together for fishery manage- ment are often not the neat interbreeding subpopulations defined in the ideal case.
> David Cushing (1995 and earlier books) was the modern champion of the unit stock concept, although thinking on adefinition of stocks goes back over acentury. According to older definitions, a stock was simply those fi s hof a given kind, or even of ageneral class like "flatfish", accessible to the boats fishing out of agiven port, or from acluster of ports grouped for statistical summary of landings. More recently, an ideal unit stock has been seen as a reasonably

> strict breeding group of abiological species, just one kind of fish, squid, or shrimp, etc. The notion that there are such
> groups arises partly because a large number of species par- ticipate in seasonal migrations to restricted spawning loca- tions in the sea that are remarkably consistent from year to year. It si these mating meetings that define subpopulations with a countable (at least in principle) number of indivi- duals, distinctive both in terms of size and age structure, with enough homogeneity in behavior and other aspects of biology to make them manageable under harvest. Such stocks have persistent proportionsof variant genotypes (as represented by blood types, other protein variants, or DNA sequences), and they vary in those proportions from stocks with mating migrations at different times or sites. Thus, genetic markers can help to define the limits of unit stocks, keeping always in mind that proportions of genotypes in population samples are required to decide fi a group of fish (or port landings) is in one stock or another. Similar pro- portions do not imply any very great level of genetic inter- mixing, since only a few individuals switching their mating site or time will provide some gene flow.
> Cushing offers the term hydrographic containment as one explanation for the recurrence across species, even phyla, of mating conventions. The North Sea plaice (Pleuro- nectes platessa), for example, gather over amodest region in the southwest corner of the North Sea (Fig. 17.1a) to spawn. Individuals travel long distances to reach this site. The nearly certain reason that selection has promoted this site as the place for plaice to mate and spawn is that the most suitable juvenile rearing habitat is in the Dutch Waddensee, and the drift of the larvae from the English Channel will bring them to just outside Texel Gate, the entry to the Waddensee, as they reach the juvenile life phase. Matching of spawning sites to subsequent larval- drift paths provides minimal loss of larvae and juveniles to waters unsuitable- for survival, and it also provides for arrival at a suitable juvenile habitat. That is the meaning of hydrographic containment.
> Gulf of Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) meet in March-April for amating spree just to the northwest of Kodiak Island over a shelf trench adiacent to Cape Kekurnoi
> on the Alaskan Peninsula. Eggs sink to about 150 m and are not advected much during 2weeks of development. On
> hatching, the larvae ascend to the upper 50m, drifting southwest in the Alaska coastal current, often in patches and often entrained for atime in back-eddies, as they feed ni the plankton-rich Shelikoff Strait, growing ta ~2mmd- through May. There are other pollock stocks associating at other spawning sites and times, particularly one on the eastern end and seaward edge of the Bering Sea shelf in May.
> Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) generally have about a dozen major and many minor spawning sites (Brander 1997; Fig. 17.1a), from Loften in Norway to Georges Bank, where breeding groups gather for relatively short
> spawning seasons. For example, cod from al over and around Georges Bank move to the northeast peak of the bank (Fig. 17.1b) to spawn in late February. In February- March, Calanus finmarchicus (copepod) adults that are ready to spawn will accumulate over this site, and their spawning provides copious nauplii for cod larvae to eat. Just as important, drift from this point retains the larvae over the bank until they are ready ot swim along the bottom. Stocks at the many mating sites are distinct geneti- cally, although an endless debate continues about the fidel- ity of individuals to mating groups and the precise statistical evaluation of genetic distinctions.
> At least some groups that mix in feeding habitats remain strongly distinct genetically, each group's members taking
> part in migrations to different breeding sites. For example, Svein-Erik Fevolden and colleagues have studied Atlantic cod in Norwegian waters, long thought on the basis of blood types and otolith distinctions to be twostocks. There a r e " n o r t h e a s t A r c t i c c o d " ( N E A C ) t h a t m o s t l y f e e d as juveniles and adults offshore in the Barents Sea and extend- ing to the Spitsbergen area, and Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) that mostly feed closer inshore and in fords. In December to January, the NEAC migrate along-shore to breeding areas near offshore banks in the Lofoten vicinity. The hatched larvae are carried in the northward coastal current back to the Barents, where the juveniles grow to maturity. The adults return north as well for the summer- fall feeding season. The NCC both spawn and feed in and near fjords al along the coast, occasionally mixing with NEAC, particularly adjacent to fjords farthest into the
> Arctic. Sarvas and Fevolden (2005) examined the frequen- cies of the A and B alleles (there are only t w o of the nuclear gene for pantophysin, amembrane protein found in secre- tory tissues. They developed a PCR technique for rapid identification of the alleles and found more than 90% Bin cod caught offshore and ni the Barents Sea identifiable as NEAC and 50-100% A in cod captured in fords and spawning at sites scattered along the Norwegian coast (Fig. 17.2). Selection alone is unlikely to sustain this level of distinction; it derives from breeding structure, although Case et al. (2006) cite evidence for a degree of selection.
> The intermediate gene proportions from some of the areas to the north can be due to either mixing of NCC and NEAC in the collections, or to actual interbreeding.
> A complex literature considers the level of genetic dis- tinctions among Atlantic cod in detail, without fully ex- plaining within-population variation in allele proportions (usually compared between years), but establishing with certainty that fish stocks diverge genetically over wide geo- graphical ranges (e.g. Pogson et al. 2001). That shows that gene flow is slow. In part, that may simply be distance, but ti also can be attributed (particularly for intra-regional cases like the Norwegian-Arctic cod and Norwegian ford cod) to separation into stocks with spawning-site fidelity, As

> sites are best for reproduction, others for feeding. Atlantic and Pacific salmon species provide extreme examples of the phenomenon, with each stream area defining aunit stock. 'The freshwater provides their larvae ("alevins") hydro- graphic containment in asense, and probably more impor- tantly it serves as arefuge from marine predators. Genetic
> studies, similar to those on Atlantic cod, have been done for many species, generally with similar results. The unit stock and hydrographic containment concepts are useful idealizations for a wide range of marine animals.
> While mating sites are many and widespread, there are also large ocean areas and stretches of coastal ocean, even very productive ones, with little spawning by fish with pelagic larvae. That is because young etlf there would be swept away to unsuitable habitats. Breeding adults do not know this; natural selection installs breeding times and locations as part of areproductive program that produces
> pantophysin alleles to show that the group ofcod spawning ta the northeast peak of Georges Bank (Fig. 17.1b) are distinct from spring-spawning cod along the southwest coast of the Gulf of Maine, and that both are distinct from

> among the hake, herring (Sinclair 1988), tuna, elasmo- branchs, squid, and a wide range of demersal fishes: plaice, flounder, halibut. Even whales migrate, often thousands of miles, switching from subpolar feeding grounds to sub- tropical areas where they visit special local sites for calving and mating. In their case, ti cannot be for hydrographic containment, but the common feature applies that some

> survivors, a program by which the young arrive in appro- priate places at appropriate times. Fish leaving young where they will be carried out of a suitable habitat do not have grandchildren. Aprime example of a spawning gap (Parrish et al. 1981) is the California coastal zone from Cape
> Mendocino to Point Conception, where eddying streamers carry newly upwelled water far out to sea (represented by the fat arrow ni Fig. 17.3), mixing ti eventually into the oligotrophic central gyre. Largely separate stocks of north- ern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) spawn to the north of Cape Blanco (southern Oregon) and to the south of Point Conception (at Santa Barbara), but not much between. Adult anchovy, and sardines also, wander through central Californian water, but they belong to spawning stocks to the north or south. The Pacific hake (Merluccius productus)

> inshore after spawning determines subsequent recruitment to the fishery. Thus, an index of "year class strength" (see below) is negatively correlated with the amount of offshore flow estimated from an index of the along-shore wind stress in January (Bailey et al. 1982).
> Fish and squid thatdo spawn off central California have different reproductive strategies. Fish like the kelp green- ling (Hexagrammusdecagrammus) and ling cod (Ophiodon elongatus) deposit their adhesive eggs on the bottom and the young hatch as rather advanced larvae. Presumably, they stay near the bottom and are not carried away. Surf perches (Embiatocidae) bear live young, large, "precocious larvae", probably capable of enough swimming to remain in the zone very close ot shore from which water is not rapidly exchanged offshore during upwelling. The rock fishes (Sebastes spp.) are live-bearing, although the young released are small, in yolk-sac stage, and not particularly competent. However, the bulk of releases are in January to early March, when flow near the coast is onshore and northward (Moser & Boehlert 1991). Sebastes larvae do get carried seaward, and they are among the most common larvae of demersal fish in the plankton beyond the conti- nental slope. Possibly, they are capable of avery long larval phase, retaining some chance of eventually reaching a suit- able settling habitat over the shelf or slope. The very oldest pre-settlement stages of Sebastes are mostly captured ni the

(ii) Managers are often overruled in the politics of fishing (Rosenberg (2003). In some approaches, R and G are explicitly included. In other, simpler approaches, the relations among X, B and Y(X,B,A) are the focus. We will consider the both types briefly. Readers seeking an exten-

> artifactually correlated with X. Fortunately, in many cases the relationship is close enough not to be attributed to this artifact alone. One way is to examine Y/X in a fishery that is somehow associated with a total count of the stock. The Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) fishery fits the requirements. The commercial fishery captures
> returning fish with gill-nets (effort in "fathom-days") in Bristol Bay, but fishing is forbidden in the inlets to the rivers. T h eyield of the gill-net fishery is measured by count- ing salmon. Once they are swimming up the rivers, people at the fish ladders and weirs watch and count the fish that escaped the fishery. By including results from multiple years, the correlation of Y/X to B = (Y + river counts) can be examined (Fig, 17.6a).
> The CPUE estimates appear to be excellent. CPUE esti- mates are alsoused for much less exact comparisons of catch
> rates to stocks. For example, Martin (2009) has compared the June sockeye catch (mixed gear with effort in boat-days) just near the south tip of the Alaska Peninsula with estimates of the total annual sockeye runs for western Alaska (Fig.
> 17.6b), predictably finding a much less exact fit.
> Another test can be applied to fish (or clams) which move infrequently (or very slowly) so that they can be totally fished out of some modest area without influence from migrants moving into the vacated space. Tropical snappers (Lutjanidae) are territorial around reefs, moving only short distances from their base to grab p r e y(or baits). Over 10 weeks, King (2007) directed fishers in Western Samoa as they fished down the Etelis coruscans stock with hook and line on a 12 km? patch of reef n o tpreviously fished. A time-series plot (Fig. 17.7a) of CPUE vs. total catch, Ysums has g as its slope. Leslie and Davis originally used this technique to estimate r a t abundances, in which
> case eliminating them was a good idea anyway, so the plot is calleda "Leslie plot". Estimates of the original total stock are either the intercept on the Ysum axis or the inter- cept on the CPUE axis, a, divided by q (which are mathe- matically equal). It is the linearity o fthe series that implies the proportion of CPUE to stock size. A similar t e s thas been done for dredgingof clams and scallops. In one exper- iment (P. Rago, unpublished), a patch of bottom (11,613 m?) with substantial numbers of razor clams was repeatedly dredged, each track sieving about 1500 m?. The Leslie plot (Fig. 17.7b) of bushels (the unit in the fishery under study, 1 bushel =135 clams) captured vs. total clams was again quite linear. It was clearly very difficult to get the last few clams. There are very few such results because a require- ment of depletion fishingcan be devastationof the stock. But they do show that in general CPUE can be a measure of stock. In most cases, however, there is no way to estimate 9, so Y/X must be used as a proxy for actual abundance numbers.
> While CPUE is useful in some fisheries, it must be kept in mind that these measures are sensitive to even small shifts in fishing technique. For example, North Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are captured by laying out lines of baited hooks across the bottom, leaving them for 12-24 hours, then reeling in the line and, on most days, fish. Up until 1982-1983, the fishersused "J-hooks", then switched to circle hooks (Fig. 17.8).T h ecapture rate p e rhook fished rose by a factor of two to three, dependingupon fish size (IPHC 1998). An apparently simple change in hook shape raised the hooking rate and reducedescapes dramatically. Sometimes subtle changes in technique occur in a fishery without managers being aware. Since fishers are intensely aware of their own CPUE, these can be

> improvements in gear, search efficiency, communication among fishers, focusing fishing atthe mostproductive times, and simply more experience in the work. Changes of CPUE caused by technique modification can appear to managers to be increases in stock size. Whenever stock condition warrants it, managerslike to (or legally must) provide fishers higher quotas orlonger seasons, so misinterpreted upward CPUE shifts can readily result in over-fishing.
> In fact, CPUE as a measure of stock size has received
> extended criticism early and late, as reviewed by Maunder
> et al. (2006). There turn out to be a many biases. A partial list includes:
> 1 a tendency to excessively high values early in a fishery as the most susceptible fish are captured, with later CPUE values becoming underestimates;
> 2 failure of C U E to fall as stocks decline because fishers focus on the remaining centers of distribution;
> 3 intentional misreporting of both catches and effort to avoid reaching quotas, to make stocks look strong, to make fishers appear successful (low Y, high Y, low X, and high X are all possible biases to reports under different circumstances);
> 4 continuous or stepped improvements in the power of a given level of fishing effort, X (at least as measured) to catch fish (also outlined above);
> 5 shifts in the accessibility of the stock to prevalent fishing methods because of climate or weather variations, prey redistributions or other environmental changes.
> To overcome at least (2), (3), and (4), some fisheries are regulated on the basis of management agency research surveys on standard station grids with fixed methods, in recent decades coupling effective sonar biomass assessments with trawling or species-appropriate capture methods. There is a reasonably good track record for such agency surveys as predictors of subsequent catch relative to indus- try effort. Fishers often view agency surveys as wrong because, ni their view, no attention is paid to where the fish are; that is, fishers know where to fish and they do not tell the agencies. That, ofcourse, is the cause of error source (2) above. The struggle to get reliable data, to "see" the fish in the sea is endless. Current recommendations are to manage by "integrated assessment" (Maunder et al. 2006) and even more broadly focused "ecosystem-based management", mentioned below. Assessments have CPUE asan input, but age structure; reproductive biology; estimated recruitment; growth dynamics; distribution patterns; predator and prey ecology; shifting oceanography; and more, are taken into account. The better-managed fisheries in the United States, in particular that on the Eastern Bering Sea pollock stock (Ianelli 2005), areregulated in light of fisheries-independent trawl and acoustic surveys, and exploitation is regulated to well below estimates of maximum sustainable yield (consid- ered below).

> (AB/At = R/B,A/ +. . . /
> Fish are considered to be "recruited" to a fishery when they are large enough to be captured by its methods. Thus, size at recruitment sometimes can be chosen by the fishers or
> by fishery managers (usually by decree). For example, the pots used to capture Dungenesscrab on the northwestcoast of the USA have an escape port just smaller than the legal size, a minimum width of carapace. Many small crabs visit the pots then leave again, and undersized crabs found by crabbers retrieving their pots are tossed back to the sea. Females are all thrown back, too. Thus, recruits are quite strictly defined as male crabs larger than the legal size. For bottom-trawl fisheries, mesh size can be adjusted, a n dpre- recruits slip through the openings - at least that is the intention. Recruitment rate (numbersof young entering the catchable stock per t i m e depends upon a list of variables, and understanding how those factors control the rate is a major scientific challenge for fisheries biologists. Variables include the number of eggs spawned, hatching success, survival to recruitment age or size, retention throughout development within a suitable habitat, and the unused car- rying capacity of the habitat available for new recruits. Survival of larvae depends upon temperature, speed and direction of currents, availability of sufficiently nutritious food of the right size, and the activity of predators and parasites. Carrying capacity can be mostly filled by large numbers of older individuals, which may inhibit recruit- ment- sometimes by cannibalism. Survival and growth of
> potential recruits are reduced by competition with larger and tougher, older individuals.
> Usually, recruitment is taken to be a quasi-parabolic function of stock size (Fig. 17.9a), referredto as a "spawner- recruit"curve. At the l o wend oft h e scale (often an "experi- ment" forced by over-fishing, but which can also be a result of climate degradation relative to the requirements of the fish) there are indeed very few recruits when there are very few spawners. Spawner-recruit relations for several herring stocks (Fig. 17.9b & c), illustrate this well. The points on the graphs retreated toward the origin as the stocks were fished down. This is very simply understood; ifthere are no parents, there will be n o young. The relationship away from the origin often, but not always (Fig. 17.10) tends to a wild scatter. Intense effort and emotion have gone into choos- ing and justifying the best mathematical functions to fit spawner-recruit curves. There are curves due to Beverton and Holt (same as the Michaelis-Menten function), Ricker,
> Cushing, Shepard, and others for fitting these stock- recruitment relationships. With rare exceptions, the debate is useless, since no one of these deterministic equations looks better as a representation of the scatter than the rest. There a r eseveral reasons beside competition f o ra spawner- recruit curve to drop at the right. For fish with planktonic larvae, it will be rare that larval numbers are so great that they limit their own resources, since larvae are a minor part of the overall pelagic ecosystem, but it could happen. Large numbers of larvae could also attract predator atten- tion, reinforcing successful prey search patterns, raising mortality.
> Of course, fisheries should always be managed in light of the necessity to sustain recruitment, that is, with the intent to keep plenty of fish active as parents. That we so often fail to operate under this simple precept is astound- ing. Sometimes fisheries are managed with the notion of maximizing recruitment. A model is chosen in which recruitment peaks below the maximum stock of spawners, and the stock is then reduced by fishing to the vicinity of that recruitment peak. The best examples are salmon fisher- ies. These are in a sense ideal for the purpose, especially if salmon are fished in or near their natal river, since spawners for the next cycle are the same fish counted as recruits in the present cycle. They are active in both roles at nearly the same time. The idea is that to maximize the number of salmon returning to a stream (recruits) there should have been some optimal number of spawners in the previous generation (stock). Since the a priori expectation is a domed function, we might guess that substantially fishing down the number of spawning salmon would actually increase the number of returning salmon available for the fishery. The argument is strained because of t h eseparation of the fresh- water and marine juvenile phases. It has to be argued that fewer eggs can produce more and healthier seaward- migrating fry or smolts by reducing competition in fresh- water, and then that the increase in seaward migrants will improve final adult returns. In some instances, the data are convincing, in others not. Results for the pink salmon
> (Oncorbynchus gorbuscha) stock spawning in the Kodiak Archipelago off Alaska illustrate both cases (Fig. 17.11a& b). If"recruits" are taken to be fry that are headed for the sea, then the data seem to show that reducing the stock to 2-3 million spawners does not reduce recruits significantly, and in some years seems to generate an addition to fry entering the sea of about 1.5-fold. If recruits are taken to be the adults returning as 2-year-olds, the relation (for which there are more years of data) is less clear. Two million spawners can return 3 million or 15 million adults to the combined fishery and spawning stocks. Survival at sea is surely variable and crucial to salmon recruitment.

Accounting for growth potential i nman- agement means adjusting the size (age) at recruitment so that fish growing at substantial rates remain in the field making meat for eventual harvest. The trade-offcan be that more time to grow is coupled with more time for natural mortality, which reduces the final take.
> Another factor is that it can be difficult to leave some of

The reason that might be valuable is that most long-lived "fish" (cod, halibut, grouper, and lobster, ... but not salmon or squid) grow continuously, albeit with slowing, to great potential sizes, often at ages measured in decades. Reaching those sizes, they are available to fewer predators,so their death ratedeclines. The benefit ofleaving
> them in the stock would be that very large females of many species produce disproportionally more eggs than younger,
> smaller females. For example, Bobko and Berkeley (2004) showed that black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) in the California Current double their annual egg output pergram of body tissue from 374 to 549 between age 6 (near earliest reproduction) and 16 years, while the total fecundity rises from 300,000 to a million embryos (their young are released after hatching). Moreover, big, old, fat, fecund female fish (lately called BOFFFF or just BOFF) actually produce bigger and better individual eggs by supplying them with more oil and protein. As demonstrated by Berkeley et al. (2004). larvae from those eggs develop and grow faster, are more resistant to starvation (Fig. 17.14) and thus have better survival chances. For some fish and some capture tech- niques, individuals exceeding a size threshold can be returned to the sea, surviving temporary capture, but for many the ascent to the surface or crushing in trawls is fatal.
