> Can you construct a mapping from each of the CV disciplines to one of the disciplines on the survey of earned doctorates? Please include the number associated with each CV discipline.
**assistant**:
> Given the extensive list of CV disciplines and the specific disciplines in the survey of earned doctorates, I'll provide a mapping for each CV discipline to the closest or most fitting discipline in the survey. Due to the detailed nature of the request, the mapping will concentrate on categorizing each CV discipline into broader categories where applicable, drawing parallels based on content and focus. Note that some fields are interdisciplinary and may fit into more than one category, but for simplicity, I will place them in the one that seems most appropriate.
