> I have a Dell OptiPlex desktop. What is the BIOS startup key?
**assistant**:
> The BIOS startup key for a Dell OptiPlex desktop is typically the `F2` key. 
> 
> As soon as you see the Dell logo during startup, press `F2` repeatedly until the BIOS setup menu appears. 
> 
> If `F2` does not work, you can try the `F12` key for a one-time boot menu. 
> 
> Remember, system designs may vary, and some systems may use a different key for entering the BIOS setup. If neither `F2` nor `F12` work, please let me know and I can help you further troubleshoot the issue.
