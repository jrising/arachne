> The PAGE integrated assessment model includes a statistical cost of civilization (the net present value of all future human life/civilization), which is calibrated as having a mean of $53 quadrillion. How was this arrived at, and is there other research to inform this kind of estimate?
**assistant**:
> The "$53 quadrillion" figure you've mentioned is likely derived from an economic value calculated using an Integrated Assessment Model, such as the PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model. These models integrate aspects of both economics and climate science to assess aspects of the climate policy, including economic ramifications of climate change.
> 
> Typically, an integrated assessment model (IAM) will calculate the cost of civilization (or the net present value of all future human life/civilization) using several factor inputs. These may include:
> 
> 1. Estimated Population Growth.
> 2. Projected GDP per capita.
> 3. Discount Rate: The method of adjusting future earnings to present value.
> 4. Damage Function: Estimating the economic damage associated with a given increase in global average temperature.
> 5. Projections for how much global average temperatures will increase.

> Regarding how they might have arrived at the $53 quadrillion value, it's likely an estimate of the expected future global GDP, considering a typical discount rate over the time periods involved.
> 
> It's important to note that these models require a significant amount of assumptions, and there's a broad divergence in the academic literature regarding the appropriate discount rate or damage function. As such, they are not without controversy and often debated in economics and policy-oriented disciplines.
> 
> In terms of other research informing this kind of estimate, there are other IAMs besides PAGE, such as DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model) and FUND (Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution). Each model uses different methodologies and assumptions, leading to a range of valuations.
> 
> IAMs and their estimates should be treated as highly uncertain and contingent on a multitude of factors. However, they do provide places to start discussions about the economic impacts of climate change, and they highlight the magnitude of the potential risks associated with it.
