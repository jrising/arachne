> To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, it is essential to actively remove  carbon dioxide, alongside reducing emissions. Marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) is emerging as a promising strategy due to the ocean's vast capacity as a carbon sink, having absorbed a quarter of fossil CO₂ emissions since 1850. However, mCDR research is still in its early stages. Many techniques remain untested in the ocean, and the short- and long-term impacts on ecosystems and coastal communities of large-scale deployment are still not well understood. This uncertainty, combined with the diverse socio-economic, cultural, and political factors surrounding ocean use, can result in varied community impacts and differing perspectives on mCDR activities.
> 
> 
> Objective: This capstone project focuses on generating a synthesis and accompanying database of best practices for community engagement, identifying current gaps, and addressing critiques. Given the environmental, social, and cultural values of ocean use, and the potential impacts on diverse communities, this synthesis aims to promote ethical and transparent engagement to inform the development of future Codes of Conducts for mCDR. 
> 
> 
> This project will draw on community engagement literature across climate, marine, and terrestrial carbon removal fields, with a focus on inclusivity, transparency, and respect for the unique concerns of local and underserved communities, including indigenous groups. Ideally, community engagement seeks not only to reassure communities about mCDR’s impact but to enlist their ideas and involvement in ways that could lead to scientific advances and enhance the project’s climate and economic benefits. This project aims to support mCDR practices that are both scientifically sound and socially responsible, fostering public trust and ensuring that the benefits of mCDR are shared equitably.

> The following is a review of co-production literature that I would like to extract relevant references from:
> ===
> 1.1 Review of co-creation principles
> Climate risk information is often generated from a scientific perspective and can have low resonance for policy
> makers due to the mismatch with their needs (Hanson et al., 2019). This issue can be addressed by using
> participatory co-creation processes.
> There is a well-advanced literature on the general process of co-creation and co-design, and this has been
> applied to the research context in recent years, including in the climate change domain. This approach was
> used in the design of the co-creation approach in the COACCH project (CO-designing the Assessment of
> Climate CHange costs), the predecessor project of ACCREU.
> The approach in COACCH drew on the co-creation literature (and in particular the reviews and best practice
> from Dilling and Lemos (2010), Mauser et al. (2012), Hegger et al. (2012), Hegger et al., (2014), Groot et al.
> (2014), Beier et al. (2016), Hollaender and Groot (2014), Campbell et al., 2016) Moser (2016), Visman et al.
> (2016), Harvey et al. (2017), Vincent et al. (2017) and Vincent et al., 2018).
> This led to the design and implementation of a research protocol and best practice for co-design and co-
> 5
> production for climate research projects (see Watkiss et al., 2018; McGlade et al., 2021: McGlade et al., 2022),
> Underpinning the original COACCH co-creation approach were a set of principles or ‘success factors which
> were produced with a literature review (Watkiss et al., 2018). These principles were revisited at the end of the
> COACCH project to update based on lessons learned (McGlade et al., 2022). The updated success factors are
> that the co-creation process for climate research should be:
> 1. Process orientated, recognizing the process is as important as the outputs. Clearly defined and well-
> structured processes and outcomes increase the likelihood of stakeholder engagement and ownership.
> 2. Objective and outcome led, with clearly identified roles and responsibilities. The literature recommends
> that the roles and responsibilities of all participants are mutually understood and agreed upon. Goal setting
> and role identification should happen early in the process to foster effective collaboration.
> 3. Targeted, ensuring representative stakeholders are involved. There is a need to limit the number of actors
> to keep the process manageable, but it is important to include a representative selection of stakeholders
> with different perspectives is included.
> 4. Transparent and inclusive, to allow alternative views. The literature stresses that co-design processes have
> to be built for inclusivity and creativity, not just for efficiency and effectiveness. The success of joint
> knowledge production will be enhanced if different perspectives of stakeholders are recognized and
> respected.
> 5. Time managed, with enough time, resources and facilities to deliver the process. The literature reports that
> co-creation demands significant time and effort, and it recommends that projects allow sufficient time for
> the process, including time and resources maintaining relationships with stakeholders.
> 6. User and decision orientated, with the aim to meet user needs and produce information of relevance for
> decisions and decision makers, while managing expectations.
> 7. Joint product orientated, using outputs to build the engagement and co-production process. The review of
> good practice co-production highlights that successful co-production often has an emphasis on producing
> joint outputs, such as joint knowledge products.
> 8. Iterative, with an ongoing process of review, learning and update throughout the project. Co-creation
> should be seen as an ongoing and collaborative process. Adjustment may be needed, especially when
> stakeholders work together for the first time. Regularly reviewing the process, including research
> assumptions, criteria, methodologies, ensures the usability of outputs. The literature highlights that there
> is a need for a monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) to support the iterative approach.
> This deliverable has reviewed more recent literature to assess if the recommended principles require updating.
> There is more literature that is now published on co-creation in the climate domain, especially for climate
> services and climate research.
> Schuck-Zöller et al. (2022) define five principles: (1) common ground, (2) transparency, (3) professionalism,
> (4) enhancement of applicability as well as (5) theoretical and empirical foundation. These are more focused
> on climate services but have relevance to climate economics research.
> A set of co-creation (research for impact) principles were developed by the Adaptation Research Alliance
> (ARA, 2021), for conducting research that is focused on generating actionable insights to drive meaningful
> impact, and particularly for locally led adaptation. These principles were based on extensive consultation of
> academic and grey literature. The six principles are: driven by user needs, co-produced with knowledge
> holders, impact-focused and measurable, sustainable over time, equitable in practice, evolving and flexible).
> Fleming et al. (2023), based on a set of climate services projects that applied co-design, co-production and co-
> delivery identify seven key factors: Frame the problem together; Allow time to build relationships, trust and
> understanding; Test and agree on expectations; Clarify key language and key outputs; Be inclusive and
> explicit; Support interpersonal skills and reflexivity; Be adaptive and match activities to objectives.
> Norström et al. (2020) identify four principles that underlie high-quality knowledge co-production for
> sustainability research. These are: Context-based (situated within the particular social, economic, and
> ecological context); Pluralistic (recognising co-creation must recognize the multiple ways of knowing and
> doing things); Goal-oriented (problem-focused and benefits and with clearly defined and meaningful goals
> 6
> shared among participants); and Interactive (with frequent interactions among participants throughout the
> process.
> The overall finding is that the principles reported in more recent literature are similar to the final COACCH
> principles, and this provides reassurance that they are still fit-for-purpose. However, these principles can also
> be enhanced with additions from the above suggestions, such as:
> - The need for knowledge production to be pluralistic and equitable in practice (Norström et al., 2020;
> ARA, 2021)
> - Transparency about the theoretical and empirical foundation of findings using clear language to
> communicate this within outputs (Schuck-Zöller et al., 2022; Fleming et al., 2023).
> Furthermore, as highlighted in the later section, emergent and reflexive design requires a more expansive
> approach and therefore the consideration of different principles.
> 1.2 Lessons from the COACCH project and the wider literature
> The evaluation from the COACCH project and its co-creation approach identified a number of lessons
> (McGlade et al., 2021: 2022):
> The role of knowledge brokers (a dedicated team from within the consortium) was critical throughout. This
> was not just at the workshops, but throughout the project to continually drive the engagement and user-focus
> and ensure the anticipated uptake of results in decision making. To support the knowledge brokers, a
> dedicated ‘relationship manager’ (selected member of the research team) was assigned to each stakeholder.
> This worked well, providing stakeholders with a reliable and direct access point to receive project updates
> and communicate their needs. It also meant that research results could be tailored and easily incorporated
> into the stakeholders’ decision-making processes.
> An important key to the success of this process was to build relationships with stakeholders (individuals and
> organizations). To encourage closer collaboration, the project involved deep engagement stakeholders who
> were involved in collaborative case studies. This recognizes that closer collaboration is only possible with a
> relatively small number of stakeholders, and therefore a twin track of stakeholder co-creation was
> undertaken.
> This means that there are four groups of actors in the process, in addition to researchers:
> • Knowledge brokers who facilitate and manage the collaborative process.
> • A wide group of stakeholders with a general interest in the project.
> • A selection of deep engagement stakeholders (DES), participating through in-depth co-production.
> • A dedicated relationship manager (researcher) to ensure continued contact for each DES.
> This means that there are five groups of actors in the process:
> • Researchers and consortium members;
> • A wide group of stakeholders with a general interest in the project;
> • A selection of deep engagement stakeholders (DES), to allow more in-depth co-production;
> • A dedicated relationship manager (researcher) to ensure continued contact for each DES;
> • A set of knowledge brokers (from the consortium) to facilitate and manage the process.
> It is important that expectations are agreed with all these actors. This includes the expectations of
> researchers as well as stakeholders. For example, in the COACCH project, we found that many researchers
> were unprepared for the scope of stakeholder engagement in a co-creation project.
> A further lesson is to carry out activities that emphasize the joint process. As with previous studies, it was
> found that developing joint products was useful, whether reports or tools, to help build the engagement and
> co-production process.
> The evaluation found that the collaborative process has to take place throughout the project, and there is a
> 7
> need to demonstrate you are listening to stakeholders. Regular and transparent reporting on progress was
> carried out for each research question to demonstrate accountability and increase trust between researchers
> and stakeholders. Efforts were made to have open channels for communication and to share interim results
> on a regular basis.
> The final key lesson was to vary and adapt forms of engagement. This can include different formats at
> workshop, as well as different forms of engagement.
> A literature review has also been undertaken to take lessons from other more recent reviews of co-creation
> processes.
> Fleming et al., (2023) report on their experience from applying the overall process of co-design, co-
> development, and co-delivery in a number of different projects. They found that each project had a specific
> context around stakeholder relationships, governance arrangements, and capacity to actively participate. They
> highlight that the three steps (co-design, co-production, and co-delivery) are not distinct, but form a continuum
> across phases of a project. They also identify the need to consider project context and to set out (in that context)
> that all parties understand their roles and responsibilities. They point to the importance of evaluations of
> outcomes and stakeholder experiences. These issues mirror the experience from COACCH (McGlade et al.,
> 2022) although the need to consider the flow across phases is a useful perspective.
> Suhari et al. (2022) identified barriers in delivering co-creation, to get common understanding among
> stakeholders, especially when there were diverging perspectives on the research problem. They also identify
> that lack of resources and training in engaging with practice partners were important barriers. More generally
> they identify five barriers to co-creation (1) Adequate entry-points and continuity 2) Competencies, skills and
> training (3) Mutual understanding (4) Integration of practitioners’ realities (5) Balancing influence. They
> include best practice suggestions on how these can be overcome, with respectively 1) Setting clear and realistic
> goals 2) Tandems of experienced cocreation researchers with newcomers 3) Providing enough time to clarify
> key concepts can foster mutual understanding from the start of the project 4) Analysis of practitioner’s contexts
> and 5) Ensuring transparency and space to negotiate decision authority. Cutting across all of these, they
> highlight that the most important recommendation is the need for a boundary manager to ensure best practice,
> i.e., a brokered process. ACCREU does use a brokered process and has identified similar best practice and the
> key role of knowledge brokers, but the idea to partner up experienced co-creators with new researchers is a
> useful addition.
> Bojovic et al. (2021) reflect on the process of co-creation and report that participatory processes gradually
> involve more specialised stakeholders over time, with researchers becoming co-learners and supporting users.
> The authors identify the joint development of products or services as a key factor in success. This does
> highlight that there may be additional opportunities to conduct a more advanced form of co-creation in the
> case that stakeholders involved in COACCH are also involved in ACCREU.
> 
> 3.2 Literature review on emergent/reflexive co-creation
> To help inform this new approach, a literature review was undertaken on how to undertake reflexive co-
> creation and what works.
> Moser (2016) sets out the different forms of co-design, and separates knowledge production from policy, the
> latter of most relevance for this task of the project. She also identifies the potential to use co-design for
> 16
> transformation, defining this as a change process that aims at fundamental change of a system’s form,
> structure, function and purpose (this is similar to the IPCC definition of transformational adaptation, see
> above) recognizing that perpetuating current trends would be unsustainable (in either or all of an ecological,
> social and economic sense). One area that is highlighted, with respect to social transformation, is the need to
> bring different actors to the table. This can include change agents, who have more radical perspectives (e.g.,
> social movements), marginalized or underprivileged groups, actors from specific vulnerable areas (of
> relevance), and actors with different cultural or social norms or views (especially to researchers). It can also
> include decisions with different perspectives e.g., from different disciplines or aggregation levels. The paper
> also suggests different communication or participatory approaches that might be relevant, including
> storytelling, talking in pairs or small groups, brainstorming, system mapping, experiential learning (field
> visits). It is noted that these methods have not been used to date in COACCH (nor planned in the instrumental
> co-creation in ACCREU) but could be relevant for this subtask.
> Page et al (2016) set out key lessons on co-designing transformation research, as the need to: (1) ensure co-
> design processes are themselves carefully designed; (2) encourage new ways of thinking about problem
> formulation through co-design; (3) carefully balance risks for the participants involved while also enhancing
> opportunities for intellectual risk taking; (4) facilitate personal transformations in co-design as a way to
> stimulate and encourage further creativity; and (5) for funders to carefully and constructively align criteria or
> incentives.
> Harvey et al. (2017) set out that this type of reflexive co-creation offers new ways of thinking and has the
> capacity to challenge existing views and norms, through a conscious reflection that arises from participation
> in the co- process. Rather than using a brokered process, it seeks to bring researchers and non-academic actors,
> from different disciplines, together for discussion in an agora (an open intellectual and social space), allowing
> existing views to be confronted. The outcome is usually some form of collective narrative, as well as a
> community of practice (that has gone through the process). Such processes are often similar to the social
> learning literature, which encourages reflection and has double and even triple loop learning. The events held
> can often include different ways of presenting the issues and encouraging debate, with theatre or participatory
> based activities, as well as communication material, including live feedback or cartoon storyboards. While the
> focus is on single events, Harvey et al present examples where wikis were used to run the discussion over a
> longer period of time.
> Lotz-Sisitka et al (2016) used co-creation to design a programme for transformative, transgressive learning on
> the nexus of climate change and other factors. They highlight that the types and processes of learning can
> drive more radical innovations, and it frames the co-creation as a process for negotiation and learning with
> others on how to bring about transformations. It also highlights the role for deliberative democracy approaches
> to bring diverse groups of people and institutions together. Interestingly, the paper differentiates
> transformative learning and transgressive learning. The former is defined as the psychosocial processes of
> cognitive and emotional and potentially also social change. The latter is a form of transformative learning that
> generates critical thinking and collective agency to directly and challenge aspects of society that have become
> normalized, and which require challenging for substantive transformation to occur.
> Byskov et al. (2021) provide an agenda for incorporating ethics and justice into adaptation and resilience
> planning for climate change. The authors highlight the need to consider justice in resilience and adaptation
> planning, ensuring the protection and representation of vulnerable communities. The paper emphasizes the
> importance of integrating different forms of knowledge within adaptation and resilience planning, raising the
> question of trade-offs in resilience and adaptation efforts and how to consider the ethical implications of
> adaptation and resilience planning in practice and options for managing risks. Colloff et al (2021) look at
> intentional transformative adaptation, and report that inherent to this issue, and to the success of
> transformative adaptation projects, is consideration of power imbalances and how they are addressed. It
> identifies that a co-production process that is depoliticised and focused on scientific solutions ignores the
> power, politics, interests and positions of those engaged in the process and presumes a scientific rationality,
> as compared to the institutional reality. Interestingly they identify that researchers have a different role in
> this case, as participants in the process (and to be reflexive) and not as sources of expertise to fix the
> problem, noting this is an unfamiliar role. Therefore, the co-creation process has to look at societal rules,
> norms and governance to in making decisions about [transformative] adaptation. They also identify the need
> to look at agency, the ability to achieve objectives through knowledge, resources, and social networks, either
> 17
> within current structures, or by working to change them (i.e. to make a difference). In practical terms, they
> identify the use of participatory visioning. This approach can reveal to participants their preferences and
> help to build trust. They note that visioning is different from scenario planning as visions are normative
> expressions of aspirations, not bounded futures or forecasts. They also recommend the process includes
> steps to broaden adaptation options, within a framework that includes consideration of values, rules and the
> decision context. Finally, they recommend that the process includes the exploration of strategies (using
> adaptation pathways).
> Chambers et al (2022) introduce the concept of co-productive agility as a key success factor for
> transformations. They define this as the willingness and ability of diverse actors to iteratively engage in
> reflexive dialogues to grow shared ideas and actions, highlighting this involves constant change and
> repositioning to navigate tensions and opportunities. They also identify there is a need to balance the need
> for critically reflexive approaches with solutions-oriented spaces. As with the literature above, it seeks to
> question dominant agendas and the underlying root causes, and to challenge assumptions and consider
> power dynamics, with inclusion of issues of justice. It also seeks to explore diverse agendas, to foster
> learning and with mutual respect for a plurality of perspectives. In more practical terms the paper sets out six
> process considerations 1) setting boundaries around what actors and approaches are relevant; 2) creating
> agile spaces for coproduction to occur; 3) initiating processes of transformation; 4) opening up pathways by
> engaging upwards; 5) enacting transformations to mobilize sustained change; and 6) examining changes to
> iteratively understand their impacts.
> Ziervogel et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of community-level capacity building and knowledge co-
> creation in supporting transformative adaptation to climate change, particularly in marginalized
> communities. They argue that a transdisciplinary approach, which involves collaborative knowledge co-
> production and integration of diverse knowledge systems, can empower community-level actors and
> organizations to assert their perspectives and contribute to transformative adaptation.
> Jarzabkowski et al (2024) report four reflexive insights from work on co-creation for disaster insurance. These
> are that translating, co-creating, and performing activities are an iterative, rather than sequential, process in
> which these activities partly overlap and build on each other.; a flexible yet robust impact object is crucial;
> co-creation is indispensable, but it is also, often, contentious; impactful research necessitates humility,
> courage, and persistence.

**user**:
> Great. Also, the goal is to make a kind of database where certain aspects of the context can be mapped to choices or principles that are highlighted as being reflected in best practices. Based on the material, can you construct a table with columns of "Context" (could just be "Any", but some papers are concerned with particular contexts), "Engagement Objective", "Principles Identified", and "Reference(s)"?
**assistant**:
> Sure! Here's a table that captures the context, engagement objectives, principles identified, and references based on the relevant papers. This structure can help map contextual aspects to best practices effectively.
