**assistant**:
> In a bash script, you can use an `if` statement along with the `!` operator and the `-e` flag to check if a file does not exist. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:
> 
> ```bash
> #!/bin/bash
> 
> FILE="your_file_name_here"
> 
> if [ ! -e "$FILE" ]; then
>   # Code to execute if the file does not exist
>   echo "The file $FILE does not exist. Executing code..."
>   # Place your actual code here
> else
>   echo "The file $FILE exists. Exiting..."
> fi
> ```
> 
> In this script, replace `"your_file_name_here"` with the path or name of the file you want to check. The `-e` flag checks for the existence of a file, and the `!` operator negates this check, meaning the code inside the `if` block will only execute if the file does not exist.
