> What kind of data does the US government make available at the level of NAICS codes? I specifically need data that is state-level or higher.

> The U.S. government provides a wealth of information at the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code level. A few primary sources of this data include:
> 
> 1. **U.S. Census Bureau**: Offers business patterns data, and other economic census data segmented by NAICS code. The data covers most economic activities and provides information on metrics like the number of businesses, employment, payroll, and more. They usually offer data down to the Zip Code level, so state-level data is definitely available.
> 
> 2. **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**: Provide industry-based data for employment, hours, and earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (both in seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted types), which can be segmented by NAICS code.
> 
> 3. **Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**: They offer gross domestic product (GDP) by industry and state-level data that can be broken down by NAICS code.
> 
> 4. **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)**: Provides state and national level energy consumption and production data classified by NAICS code.
> 
> Please note that while all these data are publicly available, not all datasets are updated frequently or cover all industries. The availability of detailed data might also vary based on the anonymity requirements and size thresholds to avoid disclosing data for individual businesses. You can often find API access or .csv downloads provided for these databases.
> 
> To check for specific availability, you might need to go to each department's website or use the [US government's data portal](http://www.data.gov). Remember that the NAICS system was developed for statistical purposes and not all regulatory or other data sets will use it.

> How do I get economic data from the census at the NAICS level?
**assistant**:
> To obtain economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau at the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) level, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Visit the American FactFinder**: The American FactFinder is an online tool provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, which allows you to access a wide range of census data. Go to the [American FactFinder website](https://factfinder.census.gov/) to get started.
> 
> 2. **Select your data set**: On the American FactFinder homepage, you'll find various options to choose from. To access economic data at the NAICS level, you can select one of the following datasets depending on your requirements:
>    - Economic Census: This dataset provides comprehensive economic data for various industries. You can find detailed information on the number of establishments, employment, revenue, and other relevant economic indicators.
>    - Annual Economic Surveys: These surveys cover specific sectors, such as manufacturing, retail trade, accommodation and food services, etc. They provide annual data on employment, payroll, and other factors.
> 
> 3. **Define your geography**: After selecting your dataset, you'll need to specify the geographic area you're interested in. You can choose at least the state or select more detailed levels such as county, city, or ZIP code.
> 
> 4. **Choose the relevant NAICS codes**: In this step, you'll be able to select the NAICS codes that correspond to the industries you want to focus on. The NAICS codes are structured hierarchically, so you can select broad industry categories or drill down into more specific subcategories.
> 
> 5. **Customize the variables**: Once you have selected the NAICS codes, you can further customize the variables you want to extract, such as the number of establishments, employment figures, revenue, or specific demographic characteristics.
> 
> 6. **View and download the data**: Once you have made all the necessary selections, the American FactFinder will display the available data based on your criteria. You can then explore the data online, create tables, charts, or maps, and download the data in various formats, such as CSV or Excel.
> 
> It's worth noting that the American FactFinder has been transitioning to a new data platform called data.census.gov. The process for accessing economic data at the NAICS level may evolve slightly, but you should be able to find similar functionalities and datasets on the new platform. Be sure to explore the website and stay updated on any changes in accessing Census Bureau data.
