> In Excel, how do I set up a conditional formatting rule on a column, so its background color is determined by a value in another column?
**assistant**:
> To set up a conditional formatting rule in Excel where the background color of one column is determined by the values in another column, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Select the Column to Format:**
>    - Click on the header of the column you want to format or select the specific cells in the column.
> 
> 2. **Open Conditional Formatting:**
>    - Go to the "Home" tab in the Excel ribbon.
>    - Click "Conditional Formatting" in the "Styles" group.
>    - Choose "New Rule" from the dropdown menu.
> 
> 3. **Create a Custom Rule:**
>    - In the "New Formatting Rule" dialog box, select "Use a formula to determine which cells to format."
> 
> 4. **Enter the Custom Formula:**
>    - Enter a formula that references the cell in the other column that you want to base your formatting on.
>    - For example, if you want to format cells in column A based on values in column B, and you are starting with cell A1, your formula might be `=$B1="SpecificValue"` (adjust the formula according to your criteria).
> 
> 5. **Set the Format:**
>    - Click on the "Format..." button to set the desired formatting (e.g., background color, font color).
>    - Choose the fill color or other formatting settings you want and click "OK."
> 
> 6. **Apply the Rule:**
>    - After setting the format, click "OK" again in the "New Formatting Rule" dialog box.
>    - The rule should now apply to the selected column based on the values in the corresponding cells of the other column.
> 
> **Example:**
> Let's suppose you want to change the background color of cells in column A based on whether the corresponding cell in column B contains the word "High". Hereâ€™s the specific example:
> - Select column A.
> - In the "New Formatting Rule" dialog, choose "Use a formula to determine which cells to format."
> - Enter the formula: `=$B1="High"`
> - Set the desired background color format.
> - Click "OK" to apply the rule.
> 
> This way, cells in column A will change their background color depending on the values in column B.
> 
> If you need further customization or specific conditions, feel free to ask!
