> which I believe is a request for me to supervise a student within one
> of the following academic programs (and it may not be clear):
>  - Masters in Marine Policy: Explain that this program has now
>    transitioned to the exciting new Environmental Science & Management
>    program
>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)
>    which has a Marine track.
>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
>    or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
>    prospective students.
>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &
>    Policy school: In this case, suggest that the applicant reach out
>    to Carlos Moffat <cmoffat@udel.edu>.
>    
> As a first step, identify any specific questions asked in the email or
> core confusions and relay them back here. I will provide any answers
> if needed to incorporate in the response. If the person is local to
> the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, or if they did schoolwork at MIT,
> Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, tell me.
> 
> For the Ph.D. programs, limited funding is available. For the EE
> Masters and ESM programs, these are self-funded programs.
> 
> We now have a form that we use to help students identify what program

> 
> If the applicant seems well-qualified to do quantitative work related
> to my research (climate change risks, food systems, interdisciplinary
> quantitative modeling) as a PhD student, encourage them to mention me
> in their statement of purpose, but note that funding is limited and
> they should apply by December 1 for full consideration.
