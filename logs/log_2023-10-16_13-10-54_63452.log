**assistant**:
> A triangular distribution can be seen as the convolution (a kind of sum) of two uniformly distributed random variables. A plausible generative process that leads to a triangular distribution would consist in the following steps:
> 
> 1. Randomly draw a number from a uniform distribution, set this as your initial number.
> 2. Draw another number from a different (or not) uniform distribution.
> 3. Sum the two numbers together.
> 
> The result will approximate a continuous triangular distribution. The peaks of the triangle will be related to the range of your uniform distributions.
> 
> Uniform distribution means that every outcome in a range is equally likely. An example of a conceivable real-world scenario would be throwing two dices and computing the sum of their results. The distribution of the sum is not uniform, but triangular, since there are more ways to get a sum of 7 (most likely outcome) than a sum of 2 or 12 (least likely outcomes). It should be noted that a die gives a discrete uniform distribution whereas we assumed a continuous uniform distribution for the explanation above. However, the analogy holds. 
> 
> Such systems could emerge in nature or human systems anywhere there’s reason to expect a convergence to a middle value versus the extremes, with the degree of symmetry in the system reflected in the symmetry of the triangle.
**user**:
> I think the sum of two uniforms will always be symmetric, and the ranges will have to be equal to not generate a flat top. Is that right?
**assistant**:
> You are correct. When the sum of two independent uniformly distributed random variables is taken, the resulting distribution will always be symmetric. This means the triangular distribution obtained from the sum will have a symmetric shape, regardless of the range of the uniform distributions involved.
> 
> To generate a triangular distribution with a non-flat top, it is necessary to introduce additional operations or transformations to modify the shape of the distribution. One way to do this is by applying a linear transformation to the sum of the uniforms. For example, you can multiply the sum by a constant value to stretch or compress the distribution along the x-axis, and then shift it along the x-axis by adding or subtracting a constant value.

> By manipulating the range and parameters of the uniform distributions, as well as applying appropriate linear transformations, you can customize the specific shape of the resulting triangular distribution to meet your desired requirements.
