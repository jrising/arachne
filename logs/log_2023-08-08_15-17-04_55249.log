> Is there a function in Excel that returns true for any number, but false for a character or for an error/NA?
**assistant**:
> Yes, Excel has a function called ISNUMBER for this task. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:
> 
> ```excel
> =ISNUMBER(A1)
> ```
> 
> This formula will return TRUE if the value in cell A1 is a number, and FALSE if the value in A1 is something else, such as text, error, or #N/A. 
> 
> Remember, this formula considers dates as numbers because Excel stores dates as numbers. If you only want to return TRUE for actual numbers and not dates, you can combine ISNUMBER and ISDATE functions like so:
> 
> ```excel
> =AND(ISNUMBER(A1), NOT(ISDATE(A1)))
> ```
> 
> This formula returns TRUE only if the value in cell A1 is a number and not a date. For any character, error, #N/A, or date, the formula returns FALSE.
**user**:
> Can I do an IF in excel to first check if something is a number and then to see if the number is greater than 0?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use the IF function in Excel to first check if a value is a number and then evaluate if it is greater than 0. Here's an example of how you can construct the formula:
> 
> ```excel
> =IF(AND(ISNUMBER(A1), A1 > 0), "Yes", "No")
> ```
> 
> In this formula, A1 is the cell reference that contains the value you want to check. If the value in cell A1 is both a number and greater than 0, the formula will return "Yes". Otherwise, it will return "No".
> 
> Feel free to adjust the "Yes" and "No" outputs to match your desired text or replace them with cell references or formulas if you need to perform further calculations based on the result.
**user**:
> When I do this, the AND returns #N/A if A1 is an #N/A.
**assistant**:
> I apologize for the oversight. When using the `AND` function in Excel, if any of the arguments are #N/A, the result will be #N/A. To avoid this issue, you can use the `IFERROR` function to handle the #N/A error and return a desired result. Here's an updated version of the formula:
> 
> ```excel
> =IF(AND(ISNUMBER(A1), A1 > 0), "Yes", IFERROR("No", "Error"))
> ```
> 
> In this modified formula, if the value in cell A1 is both a number and greater than 0, it will return "Yes". If the value in A1 is not a number or not greater than 0, the `IFERROR` function will catch the #N/A error and return "No" instead. You can replace "No" with any desired output or formula as needed.
