> I am developing a proposal, under which we will be sharing significant output data and wrapping that up in an interactive interface. Here's a section in the proposal about this:
> ===
> 2. Tools and Dataset Development
> 
> NOWASTING aims to provide accessible tools, datasets, and models that support evidence-based decision-making, enhance understanding, and foster local capacity-building. Key considerations for tools and dataset development include:
> 
> 
> Food Security Futures Explorer: Develop an interactive online platform that integrates project data, including climate projections, crop suitability, fishery productivity, and nutritional content. The Explorer will enable stakeholders to simulate different scenarios, assess risks, and explore adaptation options.
> Data Accessibility: Ensure open access to all project datasets and models through an online repository, enabling researchers and stakeholders to access and use the information for their own analyses and applications.
> Local Capacity-building: Design training programs, workshops, and webinars aimed at empowering stakeholders, researchers, and students in the use and interpretation of the tools, datasets, and models developed within the project.
> 
> 
> All of the results produced by the project will be made available online, as downloadable datasets and visualizations. This will include: (1) spatiotemporal climate projections for the co-designed scenarios; (2) effects of climate change on the crop suitability and productivity; (3) effects of climate change on fisheries productivity (4) effects of climate change on the composition and abundance of fish species and agricultural crops, and the consequences for the consumption and nutrition content of such food production; (5) projections of food production and local food availability across different socioeconomic and climate scenarios; (6) measuring possible nutrient gap or degree of suboptimal dietary intake of key nutrients for the average Senegalese and Nigerian household (according to income, region); (7) the welfare effects on (agriculture and fish) producers and consumers (of agricultural products and fishes) when harvesting, revenues, prices and product nutrition values in the respective sectors are adversely affected by climate change; and (8) potential future health outcomes from changes in nutrition patterns and under multiple public health responses. Future projections will be made at high resolution and through 2050.
> Ocean observations are crucial for informing vulnerable populations about how their livelihoods can be affected (directly and indirectly) by the increasing pressures facing the oceans. This will be also useful for contributing further the relevant stakeholders’ abilities to predict and adapt to such pressures, especially those caused by climate change and human activity.
> 
> Because of the many dimensions of this data, users need tools to explore and understand it. The Food Security Futures Explorer will be the central tool for sharing data and visualizations, and will feature interactive tools to engage a broader audience and inform policy and behavior. The interface will be co-created to support stakeholders in developing resilience to production, nutrition, and health risks. The tool will contain extensive information about adverse environmental changes to serve as an early warning system and for evaluating stakeholder adaptation options. The Explorer will Integrate sustainability and economic outputs into the model to guide producers in decision-making.
> ===
> 
> I know of free ways to do this-- I can make the interface as an RShiny app, and we can share data on public repositories such as Zenodo. But I think ti will be good to make something nicer than I could, and to plan to share more data than Zenodo will do for free.
> 
> What kinds of budget options could I include in my proposal, to convince the funders that we are serious about data and tools development?
**assistant**:
> Investing in data and tool development underscores your project's commitment to transparency, educational empowerment, and long-term usability. Here are some budget considerations you might want to include in your proposal for this purpose:
> 
> 1. **Dedicated Developer(s):** Hire full- or part-time data visualization or software development experts. Depending on your location and their skill level, you could anticipate $60,000 - $120,000 annually per full-time developer. This will ensure professional quality, maintainability and the ability to address user feedback.
> 
> 2. **UI/UX Design:** Plan to contract a UI/UX designer to ensure that the interface is intuitive and accessible. A good designer can cost anywhere between $50-$150 per hour. Allocating a portion of the budget to this will show your sincerity in creating a user-friendly platform.
> 
> 3. **Data Management & Hosting:** Handling large datasets and maintaining an online-tool require reliable and powerful servers. Base costs for managed cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud or Azure start low but can grow more than $1,000 monthly for robust applications. Professional databases, like MongoDB Atlas, can add a few hundred more.
> 
> 4. **Data Curation, Validation, and Metadata Generation:** It is crucial to ensure data quality and effective metadata creation to support data discoverability. You may need to budget for a data curator, potentially a part-time role depending on the size and complexity of your datasets. This might demand approximately $30,000 - $50,000 per year.
> 
> 5. **Training & Support:** Allocate resources for targeted training or workshops and for ongoing user support - both for your interactive tools and the datasets. Depending on the scope of your training, you could plan $500 - $3,000 per event, and a similar annual cost for support.
> 
> 6. **Maintenance & Updating:** Plan for annual maintenance to cover bug fixes, updates, and continuous integration and testing tools, often calculated as 15-25% of initial development costs per year.
> 
> Therefore, a potential annual budget just for data and tools could range from $150,000 - $400,000, though ultimately it will depend on your project's specific requirements and the balance of in-house vs outsourced expertise. 
> 
> It is evident that significant investments in data and tool development signal to funders that you regard these components as vital elements of a robust, impactful project. And these estimates will serve as an objective justification for such allocations.
**user**:
> That kind of money is not going to be possible. Currently, I have $5000 set aside for this. What can I do for, say, $8,000? And let's estimate that I have 500 GB of data and 3 dashboards for viewing different kinds of data across multiple dimensions in time and space.
**assistant**:
> With a budget of $8,000, your options are somewhat limited, but you can still take significant steps in tool and dataset development by focusing on cost-effective solutions and doing as much as possible in-house, while maintaining a high level of functionality. Here’s how you might allocate the budget:
> 
> 1. **DIY Data Hosting ($1,000 - $2,000/year):** For data hosting, you could look into cost-effective cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, which might cost around $12 to $23 per month for 500GB of storage. Another option would be using services like Figshare, which offers free uploads up to certain limits and then charges for additional storage.
> 
> 2. **RShiny App Development ($0 if In-House):** Since you're familiar with RShiny, creating the dashboards yourself will save money. The shinyapps.io service has a free tier that would be suitable for launching your app. If you need more capacity, their basic paid plan is $39/month, which would amount to $468 annually.
> 
> 3. **UI/UX Improvement ($1,500 - $3,000):** Allocate part of the budget to hire a freelance UI/UX designer for a limited number of hours to make key improvements to your RShiny app's interface. Sites like Upwork or Fiverr can help you find skilled designers willing to work within your budget constraints.
> 
> 4. **Training Materials Development ($1,000 - $1,500):** Rather than hosting live events, focus on creating evergreen instructional materials. These could be in the form of written guides, recorded webinars, or video tutorials on how to use your tools and interpret the data.
> 
> 5. **Professional Data Management ($2,000 - $3,000):** You could either hire a freelance data manager for a short-term project to set up your data structure and ensure its quality or invest in more automated data management tools which would assist in this process.
> 
> 6. **Miscellaneous ($500 - $1,000):** Keep some budget aside for unforeseen costs, subscription or service fees, and smaller tools that can help improve workflow and productivity.
> 
> To maximize your existing budget:
> 
> - **Maximize Usage of Free or Open-Source Software:** Whenever possible, utilize free or open-source alternatives to commercial software. R, Python, PostgreSQL, QGIS, etc., are robust platforms for performing complex data analysis without incurring software costs.
>   
> - **Seek Additional Funding or Partnership:** Consider looking for additional funding sources like grants focused on open data or collaboration with an academic institution that might provide infrastructure or labor (like students who can work on the project as part of their coursework) in exchange for access to the data.
>   
> - **Leverage Existing Networks:** Utilize your professional and academic networks to potentially get pro bono or reduced-cost support for UI/UX design or data management through collaborations or partnerships.
>   
> - **Focus on Scalability:** Initially, create a basic, functional system, ensuring that it’s scalable so that you can add features, improve functionality, and increase capacity incrementally as more funds become available or your project grows.
> 
> You'll need to be strategic about how you allocate funds, perhaps by doing much of the work yourself and being mindful of any services that would require ongoing monthly payments. It can also be useful to look ahead for future funding opportunities that could enable you to enhance the project's tools and datasets further.
