> I would like to plan an activity for my class that asks them to develop an adaptation strategy, over multiple years. But importantly, I want to show them how backward induction works in the process. Can you suggest a setup for this?
**assistant**:
> That sounds like an exciting and insightful activity! Here's a structured setup for your class to explore adaptation strategies using backward induction:
> 
> ### Objective:
> Students will develop a multi-year adaptation strategy for a hypothetical community facing climate challenges. They will utilize backward induction to ensure that their strategy aligns with long-term goals and constraints.
> 
> ### Context:
> - **Community Background**: Provide students with a fictional community description, including geographic location, climate-related risks (e.g., rising sea levels, increased drought), population demographics, and current resource availability.
> - **Time Horizon**: Define a specific timeline, such as 10 or 20 years, for which they need to plan their adaptation strategy.
> 
> ### Setup:
> 
> 1. **Introduction (15 minutes)**:
>    - Present the concept of adaptation strategies in the context of climate change.
>    - Introduce backward induction and how it can be used in decision-making to ensure strategies remain robust over time.
> 
> 2. **Group Division (10 minutes)**:
>    - Divide the class into small groups, ideally 3-4 students per group, to encourage collaborative thinking.
> 
> 3. **Research and Initial Strategy Development (30 minutes)**:
>    - Each group researches potential adaptation measures, factoring in financial, technological, and social aspects.
>    - Students brainstorm initial strategies for mitigating the community's climate risks.
> 
> 4. **Backward Induction Exercise (45 minutes)**:
>    - Ask each group to start at the end of the timeline and work backwards. 
>    - For example, by Year 10, what are essential conditions or achievements (e.g., infrastructure resilience, food security) needed to declare the strategy successful?
>    - Work backwards year by year, deciding what must be accomplished each year to meet the end goal.
>    - Encourage groups to consider constraints and pivotal decisions at each stage.
> 
> 5. **Presentation and Discussion (30 minutes)**:
>    - Each group presents their strategy and explains how backward induction influenced their decisions.
>    - Facilitate a class discussion about the different approaches and the insights backward induction provided.
> 
> 6. **Reflection (15 minutes)**:
>    - Ask students to reflect on their experience using backward induction and how it can be applied to real-life planning challenges.
> 
> ### Materials:
> - Handouts with community details and background information.
> - Access to computers or tablets for research.
> - Whiteboard or large paper sheets for brainstorming and strategy mapping.
> 
> ### Assessment:
> - Evaluate students on their understanding of backward induction, their ability to create a cohesive and feasible adaptation strategy, and the quality of their presentation and reflection.
