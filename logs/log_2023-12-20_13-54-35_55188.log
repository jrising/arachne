> consideration the background knowledge I have in climate change, enhancing the value of
> agricultural commodity have crucial contribution in the development and sustainable
> poverty reduction in Ethiopia and I strongly feel that a PhD in Agricultural Economics will
> be very relevant to my job back here in my country. My potential employer, Bule Hora
> University is the only state university that is working in a community based teaching
> learning process and it will be a good channel where I can transfer the knowledge gained in
> an optimized manner to my country and future generations. Like other developing
> countries, Ethiopia is dependent on the export earning of agricultural potential, to
> overcome obstacles and to achieve their goals. While working in the public sector we
> all strive for positive changes in our society. I am sure all changes we want in society
> have to start with NGO and ourselves. I shall develop national programs, which could
> help to adjust long-term relations among cultures and continents.
> This is my way, the way of a person who wants, for certain, to change the fortune of
> Ukraine and its’ folk. I am a drop of my Ethiopian people and the fortune of all the
> ocean depends on my personal experience, knowledge which I can and want to pass
> the other people. I want to conduct my thesis on Determinants of Farmers’ willingness
> to participate on soil and watershed conservation practice.
> In conclusion, I would like to say that I am eager to gain new experiences, improve
> my skills and broaden my understanding of the dynamic economic world, and I am
> persuaded that studying in the PhD in Agricultural Economics Program would contribute
> to my development as a specialist of international level in the best possible way.
> Thank you very much for considering my
> application. Yours faithfully,
> Haile Tamiru
