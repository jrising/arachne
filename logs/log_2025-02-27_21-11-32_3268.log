**assistant**:
> A good name for these sections at the end of an academic paper is "Supplementary Sections." This term encompasses all the additional, yet important, parts like acknowledgments, data or code availability, conflict of interest statements, and references. However, make sure you consider any specific terminology or structure recommended by the journal or institution you're submitting to, as these might have preferred terms or formats.

> How about simply using "End Matter" or "Final Sections"? These terms clearly indicate the concluding parts of your paper without overlapping with the "Supplemental Information" designation. You could also consider "Postscript" if you want a creative touch, though it might not convey the formal nature of those sections as effectively.

> Ultimately, clarity for your readers is key, so choosing a title that distinguishes these areas from your Supplemental Information is wise.
