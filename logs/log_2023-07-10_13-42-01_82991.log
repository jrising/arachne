> I believe that tenure in economics departments requires publishing in a "top-five" journal. Is that "top-five" list specific to different fields? Where does one find that list? Is more than one top-five required?

> The "top-five" journals in economics are often considered to be:
> 
> 1. The American Economic Review (AER)
> 2. Econometrica
> 3. The Journal of Political Economy (JPE)
> 4. The Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE)
> 5. The Review of Economic Studies (ReStud)
> 
> These are regarded as prestigious in the field of economics due to their high impact factors, expansive historical content, and acceptance of top-tier research. 
> 
> While specifying the "top-five" does provide a common standard, it is worth noting that the exact ranking can vary based on different metrics such as citation count, reputation, and impact factor. Different institutions may also have their own interpretation of what the "top-five" journals are, based on their specific field and approach to economics. For instance, environmental economists may have a different list than those focusing on monetary policy.

> As for tenure requirements in economics departments, publishing in these "top-five" journals can definitely boost an individual's application. However, it's not a universal requirement across all institutions. Each university or department has its own policies and they evaluatemultiple factors like teaching effectiveness, contributions to the department and institution, and more. Some may require more than one "top-five" publication, while others may have different standards.
