**assistant**:
> It appears that your application is encountering a hardware-related assertion failure at the level of the native macOS graphical user interface, specifically related to creating a layer tree of NSView objects, which are used extensively in the Mac GUI. This generally happens when there is an OS issue or compatibility problem between the software and the OS version, but can occasionally also be caused by underlining hardware issues. It's quite unusual for a Python application like a Flask web server to encounter such errors, which are often seen in native macOS apps that use such GUI layers extensively, unless the Flask app is integrated with some GUI operations.
> 
> Meanwhile, the "illegal hardware instruction" error that follows seems to stem from the instruction set issued to the hardware by some part of your Flask app being unsupported.
> 
> Regarding the last line, it is a warning about a leaked semaphore object, which could suggest that some resources were not properly handled. In multiprocessing, semaphores are often used as a locking mechanism to prevent data races, and forgetting to release a semaphore can lead to a resource leak, where system-wide resources are exhausted over time.
> 
> Here are some suggestions:
> 
> - **Update your system software.** Make sure that your macOS system software is up-to-date. Out of date software can have bugs that exhibit these symptoms.
> 
> - **Check the Python, Flask and dependencies versions.** Ensure you're using a stable, widely-used version of Python, Flask and other major packages your app is relying on. They should also be compatible with each other.
> 
> - **Inspect GUI operations.** If your Flask app is running some GUI-related tasks, or relying on libraries that do, try to isolate these tasks and test if they could be the root cause.
> 
> - **Profiling your application.** Use a Python profiler to examine the application's behavior and see where these issues might be occurring.
> 
> - **Investigate the semaphore issue.** Examine where in your application you start new processes and make sure to correctly dispose of any resources they use.
> 
> Last but not least, investigate any recent changes to your Flask app that might have precipitated these symptoms, especially those involving system-level operations, hardware utilization, or multi-processing.

**assistant**:
> The code you provided seems to be using matplotlib to create a plot with various subsets of data. While it's not immediately apparent why this code would cause the specific assertion failure or hardware instruction error you mentioned, there are a few potential reasons.
> 
> 1. **GUI Interactions**: Matplotlib typically relies on a GUI backend to display plots. When running in a web application like Flask, it's crucial to use a non-interactive backend, such as `agg`, to avoid conflicts between GUI event loops. Ensure that you have set the backend correctly before importing matplotlib:
> 
>    ```python
>    import matplotlib
>    matplotlib.use('agg')
>    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Compatibility Issues**: Check the versions of matplotlib and its dependencies (including numpy and any other libraries you're using) to ensure they are compatible with each other and with your system. Older versions of matplotlib or its dependencies can sometimes interact poorly with newer system updates or hardware configurations.
> 
> 3. **Resource Leaks**: This code snippet itself doesn't show any obvious resource leaks. However, in larger applications, resource leaks can occur when multiple figures or axes are created without proper cleanup. Make sure you are explicitly closing or clearing the figure and axes objects after saving the plot:
> 
>    ```python
>    plt.close(fig)
>    ax.clear()
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Concurrency Issues**: If this code runs concurrently, either through multi-threading or multi-processing, ensure that you are using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent conflicts and resource leaks. Matplotlib is not designed to be thread-safe by default.
> 
> 5. **Hardware or System Instability**: If the issues persist and are not related to the code itself, it's possible that there could be underlying hardware problems or issues with the system. In such cases, it may be worth checking your hardware for any faults or inconsistencies and running diagnostic tests to ensure the stability of your system.
> 
> By addressing these points, you should be able to troubleshoot and narrow down the cause of the issue. If problems persist, please provide more specific information, such as the version numbers of the libraries you are using, any error messages you receive, or any relevant system information, so that we can assist you further.
