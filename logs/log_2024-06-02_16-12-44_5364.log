> In flask, I am doing an ajax call for "GET /vote-updown?id=196&prob=0", but when I look at print(request.form) in the function, I get ImmutableMultiDict([]). What happened to my id and prob?
**assistant**:
> For a `GET` request in Flask, the data is not sent in the request body (which is what `request.form` captures), but rather in the URL query string. To access the `id` and `prob` parameters from your query string, you should use `request.args` instead of `request.form`.
> 
> Here's an example of how you can modify your Flask function to access these parameters:
> 
> ```python
> from flask import Flask, request
> 
> app = Flask(__name__)
> 
> @app.route('/vote-updown', methods=['GET'])
> def vote_updown():
>     id_param = request.args.get('id')
>     prob_param = request.args.get('prob')
>     
>     print(f"id: {id_param}, prob: {prob_param}")
>     
>     # Add your logic here using id_param and prob_param
>     
>     return "Vote received", 200
> 
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     app.run(debug=True)
> ```
> 
> This code importantly uses `request.args.get()` to access the query parameters `id` and `prob`. Calling the URL `GET /vote-updown?id=196&prob=0` should result in:
> 
> ```
> id: 196, prob: 0
> ```
> 
> being printed to your console.
