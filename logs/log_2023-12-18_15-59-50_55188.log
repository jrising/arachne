> Here's my Christmas letter draft of this year:
> ---
> Dear friends and family,
> I am writing this letter from under a pile of onesies and Disney princes figurines, with a single hand holding back a wall of stuffed animals from collapsing and engulfing us all. My only hope is that I can cast this note onto the sea of toys and someone will find it.
> This year, Austin turned 3 (June 8) and Oliver turned 1 (Sep. 8), and we turned around to find our lives immersed in new chaos. Easy days of turn-taking parenting are out, duets at midnight are in.
> Austin is such a curious kid. As he has tried to figure out his abstracts in the past year, a fascination for "fake" careened into an obsession with all things dark (villains, night skies, gummy bear colors). We are lucky that they don't make kid underwear (which Austin now successfully wears!) with skulls and crossbones.
> Austin loves reading with James, with predictable results. Our reading list from the last year has included many re-readings of Bea Wolf (a rumpus version where Beowulf is a 5-year-old girl whose arms hold the strength of 50 kids); every story featuring a Disney villain (with particular emphasis on Ursula, Jafar, and Hades); some Magic School Bus books (Austin is also enamored with skeletons and things being digested); and, most recently, a graphic novel of Moby Dick.
> Oliver is a total joy, always ready with full-belly chuckles. We suspect this is a coping strategy to get his frazzled parents' attention, but we won't complain. Oliver is now at the same preschool as Austin, on the ground floor of an artist complex, where his teachers photo-document their "invitations" to play and students hold regular meetings. 
> You can often find Oliver holding baskets in both hands, climbing any available stairs with a rapidity that we can never get used to. He loves to say "bye-bye" as he disappears up some stairs, and to give you a serious "nah" if you give him the wrong thing for his baskets. Just in the past week, he has gone from 5 steps at a time to perfectly controlled lurching. He has also figured out how to get into Johanna's phone, change settings, and order recurring yogurt pouch deliveries.
> The new year found us exploring ancient tunnels in Acre, Israel with Johanna's family. It was the first time we had visited relatives in Israel since pre-COVID, and it now seems like particularly fortunate timing. In March, we spent a week in London, visiting old friends while James spoke at a "future of climate risks" workshop. In April, we got to pair a wedding in California with a visit to James's relative's famous Easter party. June was Portugal, another Johanna family trip that was planned and then canceled three years ago. July and August saw plenty of time on Cape Cod with cousin Arthur (no longer "baby Arthur" at 2), Daniel, Hannah and team-favorite Uncle Noah who designs workouts with our kids as weights. September had a road-trip to North Carolina to see friends and an unexpectedly awesome science museum. Our future speculative travel plans are centered around a round-the-world trip piggy-backing off of some work James has in South Korea.
> 	James is up for tenure at the University of Delaware, and is proud and tired from this last semester, which was spent developing a new course in real-time, and writing a report on how much poorer countries are today because of climate change. Since June, James now spends all his time with his new friend, Arachne. Arachne is an artificial intelligence, who helps James with his teaching and research, helps with meal-planning and parenting, and generally puts us humans to shame.
> 	Johanna has taken more-than-her-share of the social life of the family (which has always been big). Johanna has built a community of moms, artists, foodies and friends, powered by a relentless dedication to Instagram and WhatsApp groups. The daily demands of calling on Philly's large network of female run businesses leaves little time for other jawns.
> We want to wish you all a new year of cool weather and cool friends, bad guys and good laughs! May your 2024 be peaceful, happy, and healthy and we hope to see you soon! 
> Love,
> James, Johanna, Austin, and Oliver
> ---
> Do you have any grammatical or other suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Your Christmas letter is lovely and it's an enjoyable read. I have a few minor suggestions though:
> 
> 1. "Austin turned 3 (June 8) and Oliver turned 1 (Sep. 8)"... This use of parentheses is a little jarring. Consider changing it to something like: "Austin turned 3 on June 8th, and Oliver turned 1 on September 8th,..."
> 
> 2. "Our reading list from the last year has included many re-readings of Bea Wolf (a rumpus version where Beowulf is a 5-year-old girl whose arms hold the strength of 50 kids)"... Also here, brackets are a little jarring. Consider changing this to: "Our reading list from the last year has included many reruns of Bea Wolf, a riotous version where Beowulf is a 5-year-old girl, her arms wielding the strength of 50 kids."
> 
> 3. "You can often find Oliver holding baskets in both hands, climbing any available stairs with a rapidity that we can never get used to."... All your verb phrases are in the present participle (gerund) form which makes the sentence longer and somewhat less impactful. Consider the more immediate: "Oliver often holds baskets in both hands, climbs any available stairs with a startling rapidity."
> 
> 4. "The new year found us exploring ancient tunnels..."  While "found" is acceptable, I feel like it's quite passive. Consider: "We kicked off the new year exploring ancient tunnels..."
> 
> 5. "Johanna has taken more-than-her-share of the social life of the family (which has always been big)." The parentheses is unnecessary, remove and restructure: "Johanna has taken on more than her fair share of the family's bustling social life."
> 
> 6. "The daily demands of calling on Philly's large network of female run businesses leaves little time for other jawns." I understand "jawns" is a Philly slang which may befuddle some. You could say "... other endeavors/activities." to make it more comprehensible if you wish.
> 
> Lastly, this is not an error but rather a suggestion for tonality, consider ending the letter with just "Love, The Rising Family" for a more unified and cohesive conclusion.
> 
> I really hope these suggestions help make your Christmas letter even better!
