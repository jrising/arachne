> To select the value from column B when the value in column A in that row is X in Google Sheets, you can use the `VLOOKUP` function or the `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions.
> 
> Using `VLOOKUP`:
> 1. Select the cell where you want to display the result.
> 2. Type `=VLOOKUP(X,A:B,2,FALSE)` in the cell, where X is the value you're searching for, and A:B is the range of your data (column A and column B).
> 3. Press Enter.
> 
> Using `INDEX` and `MATCH`:
> 1. Select the cell where you want to display the result.
> 2. Type `=INDEX(B:B,MATCH(X,A:A,0))` in the cell, where X is the value you're searching for, and A:A and B:B are the ranges of your data (column A and column B).
> 3. Press Enter.
> 
> In both cases, replace "X" with the value you are searching for. The first method uses the `VLOOKUP` function to look up the value and return the value in column B. The second method uses the `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions to find the row containing the value and return the value in column B.
