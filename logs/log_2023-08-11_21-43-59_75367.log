> I am using a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy to identify resources and activities that should be taken into account for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. Here is a section of that report:
> ---
> Human Use
> Areas of precaution for wind turbine development carry spatial use conflicts where development may be preferable, although developers and resource managers will have significant considerations and prioritizing in the areas represented. A variety of human uses exist in the study area, from ongoing activity to submerged obstructions.
> 
> Firing Ranges
> The Delaware Atlantic coast was formerly home to two firing ranges from the early 20th century until the1970’s (USACE, 2005). These two ranges were known as the ‘North Firing Range’ and ‘South Firing Range;’ the Delaware National Guard utilized these sites as artillery ranges in the 1950s. The North Firing Range was located within the Delaware State Seashore, north of Indian River Inlet, affiliated with Fort Miles military site. Artillery with a 20-mile range was used at this location. The South Firing Range, also affiliated with Fort Miles, was located in the present Fenwick Island State Park (USACE, 2000). This area was used as a firing range for M60 machine guns, M79 grenade launchers, and 45-caliber submachine guns as well as for firing at aerial targets (USACE, 2000). Sand extracted from these areas has been found to contain unexploded ordinances (UXOs), which are potentially dangerous and should be carefully considered when commencing installation of offshore infrastructure. The northern firing range delimitation was digitized from the USACE (2005) report; the South Firing Range was digitized from a USACE (2000) report. These were imported from a PDF file and geo-referenced. Polygon features were drawn on the map corresponding with the firing locations. Please refer to Map 44. UXOs may be hazardous for persons or equipment if such an area is chosen for turbine installations. This may be overcome through use of a magnetometer to identify any UXOs and remove them prior to installation, however, due consideration of the risks should be given.
> Potential Buffer Zones
> Even though these considerations are not depicted on the maps, it is important to mention the additional factors that potentially would need to be considered during MSP in the region. First, the NASA Wallops Flight Facility, created in 1958, is located on Virginia’s Eastern Seashore. The facility currently launches primarily sounding rockets and super pressurized balloons (NASA, 2011). In addition, the Wallops Flight Facility has a research airport, which includes tracking radar and surveillance radar. It is feasible that an exclusion zone or buffer will be required due to the potential impacts of large-scale offshore wind projects on radar. In 2007, Department of Defense (DOD) analyzed potential impacts of offshore wind projects on the missile defense early warning radars, the Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) at Beale AFB, CA, and the PAVE PAWS radar at Cape Code Air Force Base, MA (DOD, 2007). The study found that offshore wind projects could potentially have a significant impact on radars and recommended the establishment of a 25-km offset zone within the effective “line-of-sight” of the radars, taking into account the direct, refracted, and diffracted signals from the radar (DOD, 2007, p. 1). It is difficult to estimate whether similar buffer zones would be required for the NASA facility, but such scenario is possible.
> 
> Historic Places
> The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) is the primary federal law that governs the preservation of cultural and historic resources in the United States. The law established a national preservation program and a system of procedural protections to identify and protect cultural and historic resources of national, state, tribal and local significance. Under Section 106 of the NHPA, federal agencies must identify historic properties, consider the effect its proposed action will have on any identified sites, and then consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) regarding ways to avoid or mitigate any adverse effects. While the law does not mandate any particular result, it provides a meaningful opportunity to resolve potential conflicts.
> For wind turbines to be in conflict with historic properties, according to Delaware's Department of State, Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs' interpretation of Section 106 regulations (36 CFR 800.5), turbines must either create "a demonstrable negative aesthetic effect" by diminishing the current visual aesthetics through the elimination of open spaces, or through the introduction of incompatible visual elements. Under 36 CFR 800.5, the SHPO/Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) evaluates whether a proposed action will have an “adverse effect” on historical properties. Submerged lands that were dry during the last ice age and were inhabited by tribal populations also may be considered under these regulations.
> Several properties in coastal areas of Delaware have been determined historic. These include the Fenwick Island Lighthouse, Indian River Lifesaving Station in Rehoboth Beach (the Life-Saving Service is one of the precursors to the US Coast Guard), rebuilt to its original state of 1905, and the All Saints' Episcopal Church in Rehoboth Beach. In Maryland, St. Paul's by-the-sea Protestant Episcopal Church (Ocean City) is a historic listed property. This Gothic-style church on the beach is known for its unique architecture. The Indian River Lifesaving Station, as displayed on Map 44, is a historic property under the National Register of Historic Places. Under section 106 of the NHPA, all Federal Agency actions require consultation with the SHPO to assess adverse impacts to the historic property. Adverse impacts could include introduction of visual elements, although only to the extent that they “diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic features” (36 CFR 800.5 (a)(2)(a)(v)).
> In addition to the properties on the National Historic Register, any effect on the view of the ocean from Assateague Island National Seashore off the coasts of Virginia and Maryland, extending just south of Ocean City, Maryland, is also likely to be considered during the MSP process. In 1964, Congress established Assateague Island National Seashore in order to protect and develop Assateague Island "for public outdoor recreation use and enjoyment" (16 USC § 495f). Congress subsequently directed the Secretary of the Interior to make a comprehensive plan for the protection, management, and use of the seashore that would include uses of waters adjacent to the seashore that would reasonably influence the use of the seashore (16 USC § 459f–11). In addition, other federal agencies that are considering issuing a loan, grant or license for a project that in the Secretary’s judgment would "significantly adversely" affect Assateague are required to consult with the Secretary to determine if the proposed project is consistent with the Secretary's plan. More generally, a scenic buffer may be required under the National Park Service Organic Act of 1916 (16 USC l), which governs all national parks, monuments and other reservations, and declares that fundamental purpose of said parks, monuments and reservations is “to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.” A scenic buffer would likely reduce the visual impact on Assateague Island National Seashore, and could be necessary if viewshed impacts are found to conflict with public outdoor recreation use and enjoyment.
> Archaeological Shipwrecks and Delaware Antiquities Act
> There have been a total 250 known wrecks along the Delaware/Maryland coast, fifteen of which were recorded at the Indian River Inlet (John Milner Associates, 2004). Most of these shipwrecks were recorded to have grounded onshore or the near-shore shoals.
> Under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 (43 USC 2101 et seq.), the U.S. government owns abandoned shipwrecks on federal lands. However, the act also guarantees public access to these (historic or non-historic) shipwrecks (43 USC 2103 (a)) for recreational uses. According to the Abandoned Shipwreck Act Guidelines (54 FR 13642, April 4, 1989) established by the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, Federal agencies must "have established programs to survey, identify, document, evaluate, protect, and preserve historic properties that are under their ownership or control or that may be affected by their programs and projects." If the Secretary of the Interior deems a shipwreck as historically significant, then the historic shipwreck must be preserved, and any action that may significantly alter or destroy the landmark requires consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). In addition, if access to any shipwreck is restricted, then it is mandatory to consult affected interest groups.
> Under the Delaware Antiquities Act (7 Del. C. 5303 et seq.), the Delaware Department of the State has authority to enhance, preserve and protect archaeological resources, and may take title to all archaeological resources on State lands, including those in or on subaqueous lands. The State has title to all shipwrecks embedded in subaqueous lands, and any person seeking to excavate or alter any archaeological resource must seek a permit under § 5309. According to data from NOAA’s Electronic Navigational Charts, there are currently 17 shipwrecks that lie within the borders of the proposed study area (Map 44), seven of which are deemed "dangerous." Only one of the shipwrecks - the Roosevelt Inlet Shipwreck off of Lewes - is recognized on the National Register. It is unlikely that the offshore wind projects will be located so close to shore, therefore, projects would not likely have an impact on this historically significant shipwreck. Other sites are not listed and thus only a guarantee of public access or consultation with stakeholders when access is restricted is required.
> Native American Artifacts
> Under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, any native artifacts inadvertently discovered during the construction of an offshore wind project must be reasonably protected, and construction must be halted until the items discovered are protected (25 USC 3002(d)). Removal of any archaeological resource requires a federal permit under the Archaeological Resource Protection Act of 1979 (16 USC 470 et seq.). Notice must be given to any Indian tribe that may consider the site as having religious or cultural importance (16 USC 470cc(c)). Although Indians are known to have been living on the Delmarva Peninsula, specific sites containing artifacts are either unknown or unpublished.
