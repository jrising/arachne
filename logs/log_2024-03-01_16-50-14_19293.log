**user**:
> I have a subversion repo on my computer, but the repo on the server has been corrupted. How can I save my subversion repo files to a new, empty repo that I've just set up on the server?
**assistant**:
> The process you need to follow involves dumping your repository on your local machine and then importing it into your new repository on the server. Please remember to back up any important data before proceeding. Here is how you can do this:
> 
> ### On Your Local Machine
> 
> 1. First, you need to dump your repository. Open a terminal and change directory (`cd`) to where your repository is located.
>    ```
>    cd /path/to/your/repository
>    ```
> 2. Use `svnadmin dump` to create a dump of the repository.
>    ```
>    svnadmin dump . > repo-dumpfile
>    ```
> This will create a file named `repo-dumpfile`. Make sure the command is executed successfully. The `.` specifies the current directory, or you can replace this with the path to your repository if you haven't `cd`ed into it.
> 
> ### On Your Server
> 
> 3. Next, `scp` or otherwise transfer the dump file to your server.
>    ```
>    scp repo-dumpfile username@your.server:/path/to/new/location
>    ```
> 
> 4. On your server, go to your new, empty repository.
>    ```
>    cd /path/to/your/new/repository
>    ```
> 
> 5. Now, you load the dump file into the new repository.
>    ```
>    svnadmin load . < repo-dumpfile
>    ```
> The `.` specifies the current directory, or you can replace this with the path to your new repository if you haven't `cd`ed into it.
> 
> If everything goes as planned, your local repository should now be replicated on your server! Keep in mind that you'll need to have `svnadmin` rights to execute these commands.
> 
> Remember to update your local working copy to point to the new repository on the server. You can do this with the 'svn switch' command:
> 
> 6. In your local working copy directory, use `svn switch` to point to the new repository URL.
>    ```
>    svn switch --relocate old-repo-url new-repo-url 
>    ```
> 
> If you encounter any issues or have questions with these instructions, please feel free to ask!
