> Ankit Anuragi: I want to build my career as a data scientist and for that, I have to gain a lot of knowledge and experience this can only be achieved by working on some project or internship. This project is offering the right profile with the perfect match for my interest. I like working on tasks related to technological applications. My interest in Machine learning and deep learning begins with my first course on machine learning “Machine Learning by Andrew Ng” wherein I was introduced to the basics of Machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I always had a deep affinity for maths and consequently developed a keen interest in this field due to the steadfast application of maths in it. My quest to know more and my hunger to use my exceptional analytical skills in maths has made me decide to go for this real world as this project offers the same set of working and learning environments for me. I already have experience in using ml/dl predicting power and I am eagerly waiting for a chance to apply my knowledge in this domain.

> Jagori Bandyopadhyay: In today's world, technology is one of the most important tools we have to combat climate change. The use of data science, in particular, can play a significant role in mitigating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. As an aspiring data scientist, I am passionate about leveraging my knowledge of technology and innovation to make a positive impact in this field. Shedding light on my previous experiences, I have worked on an NLP project under the guidance of my professor wherein I developed a model which can predict the stock price volatility of a company based on the audio and transcript of their quarterly earnings call. This project taught me valuable skills like Data collection, handling, cleaning, and Multimodal Deep Regression. I am currently working on improving its results using BERT. I have handled and trained huge datasets as a part of Hackathons. I was graded as ‘Excellent’ in the ‘Machine Learning Foundations and Applications’ course and the ‘Programming and Data Structures’ course offered by my Institute. I genuinely enjoy researching and studying topics in-depth. I am eager to contribute wholeheartedly to revamping the Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE) model and would be honored to join your team.
