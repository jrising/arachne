> How do I label each feature using a field value in QGIS?
**assistant**:
> Sure, here is a step-by-step guide on how to label each feature using a field value in QGIS:
> 
> 1. Load the layer into QGIS.
> 
> 2. Make sure the layer is selected (highlighted) in the 'Layers' panel. 
> 
> 3. Go to the 'Layer' menu at the top of the screen, then go down to 'Properties'. Alternately, you can also right-click on your layer in the 'Layers' panel and select 'Properties'.
> 
> 4. In the 'Layer Properties' box that opens, on the left-hand side, click on 'Labels'.
> 
> 5. Now, near the top of the 'Layer Properties' screen, you should see a dropdown option that says 'No Labels'. Click on this dropdown menu and change the selection to 'Single labels'.
> 
> 6. Once you've selected 'Single labels', a new dropdown menu will appear right below it, where you can select the field you want to use for your label. This menu will contain all available fields you can label by. Simply pick the desired field.
> 
> 7. Click on 'Apply' at the bottom right of the window and watch your labels appear on the map. If you are happy with the changes, click 'OK'.
> 
> The labels are fully customizable. If you need to adjust the appearance of the labels (e.g., change the font, color, or size, or add a halo around the text), you can do this within the same 'Labels' tab in the 'Layer Properties' dialogue box. 
> 
> Remember, you also have the option to create conditional labeling by using expressions. These options offer flexibility in how you choose to represent your data.  
> 
> I hope this helps, James! If you have further questions about this process or anything else, don't hesitate to ask.
**user**:
> I want all my labels to show, but I don't mind if they are displaced vertically (less so, horizontally) to do so. How can I allow automatic placement like this?
**assistant**:
> To allow for automatic label placement while prioritizing label visibility over strict positioning, you can use the "Labeling Placement" options in QGIS. Here's how you can achieve this:
> 
> 1. Follow steps 1 to 5 from the previous response to access the "Layer Properties" dialog box and select the "Labels" tab.
> 
> 2. In the "Labels" tab, you'll find a section called "Labeling Placement." Here, you can customize how the labels are positioned on the map.
> 
> 3. Choose the placement strategy that suits your needs. QGIS offers several options, including "Around point," "Offset from point," "Horizontal," "Free," and more.
> 
> - "Around point" places the label around the feature without overlapping it. It allows for some displacement to ensure visibility, both vertically and horizontally.
> - "Offset from point" moves the label a certain distance from the feature, allowing for more control over displacement but still prioritizing visibility.
> - "Horizontal" aligns all labels horizontally, which can be useful if your features are linear.
> - "Free" gives the most flexibility by allowing complete freedom of label placement, but it may result in overlapping.
> 
> 4. Once you've chosen an option, you can further fine-tune it by adjusting the parameters provided. For example, you can set the maximum number of tries to place a label before skipping it, or the maximum distance the label can be shifted to find placement.
> 
> 5. Preview the label placement by clicking the "Show Preview" button. This will display the labels on the map according to your chosen placement strategy and parameters.
> 
> 6. Experiment with different options and parameters until you achieve a label placement that balances visibility and positioning to your satisfaction.
> 
> Remember, label placement is subjective and depends on your specific data and preferences. You may need to iterate and adjust the parameters to achieve the desired result.
> 
> I hope this information helps, James! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
