> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters and information about spatial planning for activities. Prior to this report, perhaps the most comprehensive collection of materials to inform marine spatial planning is a report, “Delaware Marine Spatial Planning: Offshore Wind Context” by Bates et al., 2012.
> 
> We have used this report as a partial template. Since this information is now a decade old, we have also worked to collect updated forms of the data.
> 
> I would like to include a section in the report on our attempts to build upon the work of Bates et al., and I want you to develop a draft of this material. Below are two status reports on the material to inform this section.
> 
> Status report 1: This makes an initial check on what datasets we wanted to ask the author (Alison Bates) about vs. which ones we could collect ourselves. We did contact Alison about their data, but decided not to ask for any datasets because of the challenges they would have in sharing the data, which would be quite old anyway.
> List of datasets to ask Alison about
>  AIS Data Analysis ( Confidentially agreement with BOEM & NOAA)
>  Traffic Separation Schemes ( TSS shape-file form AIS ? )
>  Anchorage Area ( ???)
>  Commercial Fishing ( VTR from NOAA- NMFS, Confidentially agreement) 
>  Recreational Fishing ( VTR from NOAA- NMFS, Confidentially agreement) 
>  Sand Barrow Location ( USGS, methodology of extracting data is not clear)
>  On-shore Transmission ( on demand data from Delmarva and Delaware Electric Cooperation )
>  Under-Sea Electricity Transmission Hub ( AWC) [ They did mention about a data request and pdf version, but I can not find anything ]
>  Paleovalley  ( McKema & Ramsey, 2002)
> List of datasets to collect
>  Cold-Water Corals (NOAA/ NCEI)

> #Updating the Foundations of Marine Spatial Planning in Delaware: Building Upon the Work of Bates et al.
> 
> In the pursuit of advancing marine spatial planning in Delaware, our team endeavored to build upon the foundational work of Bates et al., painstakingly updating, revising and, where necessary, replacing the datasets originally used in their influential 2012 study, “Delaware Marine Spatial Planning: Offshore Wind Context.” This effort required an extensive exploration of data sources, careful verification of information, and a keen understanding of the intricacies of marine spatial planning.
> 
> Our initial plan of action involved reaching out to Bates and colleagues who contributed immensely to the reports in order to obtain firsthand data. After a sober evaluation of the enormous challenges associated with transferring and using the decade-old data, we decided to embark on a laborious journey of collecting the information ourselves.
> 
> ##Physical Data
> 
> ###Bathymetry
> 
> We encountered difficulties in finding an exact bathymetry dataset to match Bates et al.'s, hence a direct update is not available yet. We have found a collection of various bathymetry datasets on the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and used that to the best of our capabilities.
> 
> ###Sediments
> 
> We were successful in acquiring an updated sediment dataset. Collected from the U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 118, the dataset, 'usSEABED: Atlantic Coast Offshore Surficial Sediment Data Release, version 1.0', constitutes part of our new foundation for marine spatial planning.
> 
> ###Sand Borrow Locations
> 
> Our efforts in updating the physical datasets extended to sand borrow locations. We accessed and harvested federal sand and gravel lease borrow area data from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
> 
> ###Paleovalleys
> 
> We were unable to find a paleovalley dataset to match the one used by Bates et al. The Delaware Offshore Geologic Inventory provided some relevant information, including sediment samples, radiocarbon and amino acid racemization dates, seismic profiles, and vibracores, though not in the format we needed.
> 
> ##Biological Data
> 
> ###Marine Mammals
> 
> The task of updating the marine mammal dataset was partially successful. While we found similar data at Duke University's SeaMap, an error message appeared during the download process, indicating the unavailability of the required data file. Future attempts will be made to rectify this issue and secure the complete dataset. 
> 
> ###Cold-Water Corals and Essential Fish Habitat
> 
> We triumphed in our search for updated datasets for cold-water corals and essential fish habitats. We found these datasets on NOAA/NCEI and MARCO respectively.
> 
> ###Avian
> 
> We also identified three different sources to compile an updated avian dataset, which includes the Mid-Atlantic Avian Abundance model from Duke University's SeaMap, the USGS Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset Catalog, and a database of marine mammal and seabird research activity in the Pacific (US).
> 
> ###Bats
> 
> Challenges met us in our search for an updated bat dataset. Accessing the dataset requires approval from the Delaware NABat Projects leader. We encountered a stumbling block during this process as the University of Delaware is not listed in their organization list. We continue to deliberate possible solutions.
> 
> ##Human Activities
> 
> ###Traffic Separation Schemes, Shipping and AIS
> 
> We were able to acquire updated datasets on Traffic Separation Schemes, AIS and shipping, which are crucial for effective marine spatial planning. The AIS data was obtained from the repository.
> 
> ###Fishing (Commercial and Recreational)
> 
> Our success continued in the human activity sphere with updates to the commercial and recreational fishing data. We partially updated the commercial fishing dataset, as some species mentioned in the original study were absent in the new data. For recreational fishing, we utilized NOAA's 2022 catch level and trip level data.
> 
> ###Artificial Reefs and Historic Places
> 
> Artificial reefs and historic places were among the datasets collected. The former was compiled from DNREC while the latter from the National Register of Historic Places. 
> 
> ###Potential Buffer Zones, Firing Ranges, Dump Sites, Native American Artifacts, Undersea Electricity Transmission Hub, On-Shore Transmission and Wind Resource
> 
> Unfortunately, we did not find the necessary datasets to match the ones mentioned in Bates et al.'s report. Our search for updated information on potential buffer zones, firing ranges, dump sites, Native American artifacts, undersea electricity transmission hubs, on-shore transmission, and wind resources did not yield substantial results.
> 
> ###Submarine Cables
> 
> The updated submarine cable dataset, however, was successfully collected from NOAA.
> 
> In conclusion, enhancing the work initiated by Bates et al., our comprehensive investigation has illuminated not only the challenges in marine spatial data acquisition but also the dynamism of the data landscape. As we continue to refine this living body of information, we understand that our achievement essentially represents a single step forward in the journey towards effective conservation, use and governance of our marine environments.
