> The transformer-based technology behind large language models (LLMs) has the potential to be a revolutionary tool for socio-environmental systems research, communication, and monitoring. The goal of this project is to integrate an LLM with spatiotemporal environmental data and on-demand modeling. The result will be an interactive tool that can support multiple steps in the research and management process for complex socio-environmental systems, while addressing existing validity problems with LLM technology. Specific applications include hypothesis generation, advising on data and analytical methods, scenario and storyline development, environmental risk analysis, prioritization of research and information needs, and stakeholder engagement.
> 
> The application of focus for this project is scenario development, where the integrative strengths of LLMs have particular potential. An LLM tool with embedded access to current and future environmental would support risk identification and management, cascading and concurrent outcomes of interest, and stakeholder and expert elicitation. By closing the feedback loop between quantitative modelers, soft data sources, and stakeholders, LLM technologies may enable the next generation of scientific models.

> Methodologically, the project would take a two-pronged approach: (1) We would build upon an appropriate state-of-the-art open-source pre-trained LLM, adding nodes with custom behavior that provides quantitative information, and then training the network to use these. (2) We would develop a multi-step approach with an existing internet-scale model, where queries are translated into function calls to provide additional contextual information, before producing the final response. We would then compare these approaches with both pre-defined tests and in experiments with users.

**user**:
> One of the pre-proposal requirements is:
> The first page of the pre-application must specify at least one scientific hypothesis whose investigation motivates the proposed work, using no more than 100 words, in a box with a black border. For any hypothesis that is not itself innovative, the pre-application must describe at least one innovative insight into how the hypothesis can be investigated that may be exploited by the planned research.
> 
> Can you propose what our hypothesis could be?
**assistant**:
> Here is a proposed hypothesis that could drive and motivate your proposed work:
> 
> **Hypothesis:**
> "The integration of large language models (LLMs) with spatiotemporal environmental data and on-demand modeling will significantly enhance the capacity for scenario development in complex climate risk analysis."
> 
> **Innovative Insight for Investigation:**
> By leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs in conjunction with real-time environmental data feeds and iterative stakeholder engagement, the planned research aims to explore how the dynamic interplay between qualitative narratives and quantitative modeling can lead to more accurate and actionable insights for managing complex climate risks scenarios. This innovative approach seeks to bridge the gap between traditional scenario planning methods and cutting-edge AI technologies, enabling a more holistic and interactive decision-support tool.
