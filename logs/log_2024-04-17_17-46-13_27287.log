> I am constructing a list of xarray datasets, and now I want to merge them into a single dataset where each of the datasets has a different coordinate value. So, along a new "ssp" coordinate in the merged dataset, the first dataset in the list would be called "SSP1", then the next is "SSP2", and so on. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by initializing a new coordinate in each dataset in your list using the `assign_coords()` function, and then concatenate them along the new coordinate. Here's a basic example in Python:
> 
> ```python
> import xarray as xr
> 
> # Assuming datasets is your list of xarray Dataset
> datasets = [ds1, ds2, ds3, ...]
> 
> # Assign new coordinate to each Dataset
> for i, ds in enumerate(datasets):
>     datasets[i] = ds.assign_coords(ssp=("ssp", [f"SSP{i+1}"]))
> 
> # Concatenate all datasets along new 'ssp' coordinate
> merged_dataset = xr.concat(datasets, dim="ssp")
> ```
> 
> This script assumes that `ds1`, `ds2`, `ds3`, ... are your xarray datasets. The `enumerate()` function is used to get the index `i` of the list (which starts from 0), and we add 1 so that the SSP numbering starts from 1. The `assign_coords()` function is used to add a new coordinate `ssp` to each dataset, with a single valueâ€”`SSP1` for the first dataset, `SSP2` for the second one, and so on. Finally, the `xr.concat()` function concatenates all datasets along the new 'ssp' dimension.
