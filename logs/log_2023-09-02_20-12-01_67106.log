**assistant**:
> No, the estimated coefficients from your econometric model would not necessarily be a weighted sum of the betas for the two data-generating processes (DGPs). The output you get would depend on how these processes overlap and interact, the structure of the errors, and the assumptions you've made in your model.

> Most standard econometric techniques (like ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood estimates) assume a single underlying DGP. When multiple DGPs are present, these methods can produce biased or inconsistent parameter estimates.

> In your case, if the two processes are not correctly accounted for and separated, the resulting estimates may merely reflect an amalgamation of the two processes - probably not a simple weighted sum unless the processes are very simple and the mixture is essentially linear. Estimates could be more influenced by the process that contributes more data, has less noise, or that better fits the model's assumptions.
