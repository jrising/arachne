> 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2024.102938,Agricultural resilience: Impact of extreme weather events on the adoption of rural insurance in Brazil,"Brazil's agricultural, livestock, and forestry production is essential, feeding more than 10% of the global population. However, climate change and extremes affect quality and production, challenging the Sustainable Development Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty. Extreme weather events generate economic and social costs, driving the use of adaptation strategies, with rural insurance being one of the main instruments to manage these risks. This study analyzes the impact of extreme weather events on rural insurance contracting in Brazil, using daily precipitation and temperature data to calculate extreme weather indices and perform panel regressions. The analysis of Minimum Comparable Areas (MCAs) between 2006 and 2016 showed that events such as “Frost” and “Hot Days” significantly increased insurance contracting, especially in the South and Central-West regions. The results highlight the importance of extreme variables and the need to consider regional differences and insurance alternatives. Despite the importance of insurance, increasing financial unviability suggests the need for additional strategies, such as crop diversification, community solidarity, and conservation of agricultural practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

It contributes substantially to the livelihoods of millions of small producers worldwide. Coffea canephora represents 40% of the world's production of beans. Coffea canephora is a perennial crop, it is sensitive to climate, and several production areas in Brazil may become unfit for C. canephora cultivation due to expected climate change. Thus, knowledge of the temporal dynamics of favorable climate conditions for C. canephora in Brazil is necessary. This work aims to elaborate the CLIMEX model to predict the climatic suitability for C. canephora in Brazil in the current climate and front of climate changes for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100. The model shows a good agreement between the density and the growth rate of the species, which indicates significant reliability of the results in the proposed model. Our modeling results show that there has been a reduction in the areas very favorable to C. Canephora over the years, in the North, Southeast, and the entire east coast of the Northeast regions. Compared to the current scenario, the model projection reduces by 49, 73, 82, and 88% in 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100, respectively. The results may help long-term planning strategies to mitigate the economic effects of the climate change scenario on C. canephora production in Brazil.

Nevertheless, the accelerated growth of tourism in various nations might lead to significant environmental consequences due to heightened energy consumption. This surge in energy usage contributes to the exacerbation of global warming through the amplified release of carbon dioxide (CO2). In light of the increasingly evident impacts of climate change on the natural environment, a multitude of endeavors have been undertaken with the aim of attaining ecological sustainability. The objective of this study is to examine the dynamic effects of economic growth, energy consumption, and tourism on carbon emissions in Brazil by analyzing time series data spanning from 1990 to 2019. The stationarity of data was assessed through the application of unit root tests, while an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach was employed to analyze the relationship between the components, accounting for both the long-term and short-term dynamics. The empirical results indicate that a 1% rise in economic growth, energy consumption, and tourist arrivals leads to environmental deterioration by causing a respective increase in CO2 emissions of 1.37%, 1.06%, and 0.57% in the near term, and 0.72%, 0.62%, and 0.16% in the long term. This article presents policy ideas aimed at achieving carbon neutrality in Brazil by increasing the utilization of renewable energy sources, while simultaneously fostering sustainable tourism as a means to enhance the country’s economy. Highlights •This study investigated the tourism-economy-energy-environment nexus in Brazil. •The econometric analysis revealed that tourism, energy use, and economic growth increase CO2 emissions. •This article offers policy suggestions to achieve sustainable tourism and carbon neutrality.

The manufacturing sector’s recovery is analyzed in light of the proposal to reindustrialize the economy in the ongoing global climate emergency. In line with the new-developmentalist literature, reindustrialization implies widening policy space to recover public and private investment in productive assets, providing financial conditions compatible with long-term re-turns. It assumes an active role in state intervention. In this sense, the New Brazilian Industry industrial policy should anchor long-term expectations to enhance productive investment committed to the green transition. This approach positions industrial policy as the anchor to build a sustainable development convention. © 2024, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Museu de Zoologia. All rights reserved."

It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020–2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030–2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
> 10.1142/S2010007823500124,THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON FAMILY FARMING AND LARGE-SCALE AGRICULTURE IN BRAZIL: A COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM APPROACH,"This paper analyzes the regional economic impacts of climate change (CC) on the agricultural productivity of crops linked to family farming and large-scale agriculture in Brazil. Variations in agricultural productivity estimated according to CC scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 [IPCC (2014). Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report. Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Core Writing Team, RK Pachauri and LA Meyer (eds.), IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland, 151pp.], between 2021 and 2050, were used as inputs in the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model AGRO-BR to project the economic impacts of the phenomenon. The model presents regional configuration composed of the 27 Brazilian Federation Units and 42 agricultural sectors, disaggregated into family farming and large-scale agriculture sectors. The results indicate that the North and Northeast regions would be negatively affected, Midwest and Southeast would suffer moderate impacts, while the South region would benefit mostly. São Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul would show economic growth, softening the negative impacts on national GDP. Regional disparities and the deterioration of food security conditions could increase in Brazil.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company."

However, the evidence is limited in low- and middle-income countries, and the productivity losses due to non-optimal temperatures have not been quantified. We aimed to estimate the work-related impacts and economic losses attributable to non-optimal temperatures in Brazil. We collected daily mortality data from 510 immediate regions in Brazil during 2000 and 2019. A two-stage time-series analysis was applied to evaluate the association between non-optimum temperatures and the Productivity-Adjusted Life-Years (PALYs) lost. The temperature-PALYs association was fitted for each location in the first stage and then we applied meta-analyses to obtain the national estimations. The attributable fraction (AF) of PALY lost due to ambient temperatures and the corresponding economic costs were calculated for different subgroups of the working-age population. A total of 3,629,661 of PALYs lost were attributed to non-optimal temperatures during 2000–2019 in Brazil, corresponding to 2.90 % (95 % CI: 1.82 %, 3.95 %) of the total PALYs lost. Non-optimal temperatures have led to US$104.86 billion (95 % CI: 65.95, 142.70) of economic costs related to PALYs lost and the economic burden was more substantial in males and the population aged 15–44 years. Higher risks of extreme cold temperatures were observed in the South region in Brazil while extreme hot temperatures were observed in the Central West and Northeast regions. In conclusion, non-optimal temperatures are associated with considerable labour losses as well as economic costs in Brazil. Tailored policies and adaptation strategies should be proposed to mitigate the impacts of non-optimal temperatures on the labour supply in a changing climate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
> 10.1080/15567036.2023.2251921,The determinants of CO2 emissions in Brazil: The application of the STIRPAT model,"CO2 is one of the crucial concerns of the global economy due to its negative environmental impact. Based on the limitations of extant studies, this research employs the STIRPAT framework to investigate the asymmetric effect of urbanization (URB), gross domestic product (GDP), and energy intensity (EINT) on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) in Brazil from 1980–2022 using innovative econometric techniques such as Non–linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS). The NARDL findings are as follows: (i) The NARDL bounds test confirmed the existence of long–term association; (ii) In the long–term, a positive change in URB reduces CO2 by 8.6%, while an adverse change in URB does not affect CO2. In the case of GDP, a positive change raises CO2 by 1.73%, whereas a negative change reduces CO2 by 2.94%. For EINT, a positive change induces CO2 by 2.12%, while a negative change decreases CO2 by 3.82%; (iii) In the short–term, an adverse change in URB spurs CO2 by 0.39%. For GDP, a positive change raises CO2 by 1.73%, whereas a negative change reduces CO2 by 2.94%. Lastly, a positive EINT change drives CO2 by 2.12%; (iv) The DOLS findings confirm the NARDL results. The policy implications are discussed. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
> 10.1007/s13412-022-00782-w,"Dynamic impacts of economic growth, energy use, urbanization, tourism, agricultural value-added, and forested area on carbon dioxide emissions in Brazil","Global climate change caused by greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, poses incomparable threats to human life, the environment, and development. The present study empirically investigates the dynamic impacts of economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, renewable energy use, urbanization, tourism, agricultural value-added, and forested area on CO2 emissions in Brazil. Time series data from 1990 to 2019 were utilized by applying the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach followed by the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) method. The DOLS estimate findings reveal that economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, urbanization, tourism, and agricultural value-added cause environmental degradation by increasing CO2 emissions in Brazil while increasing renewable energy use and forested areas help to mitigate the CO2 emissions in Brazil. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). In addition, the pairwise Granger causality test is utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables. This article put forward policy recommendations toward sustainable development by establishing strong regulatory policy instruments to mitigation of CO2 emissions. © 2022, AESS."
> 10.1007/s10308-021-00645-z,How and why European and Chinese pro-climate leadership may be challenged by their strategic economic interests in Brazil,"Climate change has been socially constructed crisscrossed by public and private interests, asymmetries and world-view conflicts. When it comes to the legitimacy of norms to address the complexities of social conditions of vulnerability and effective actions to fulfil distributive and climate justice principles, climate change still faces a discrepancy between political announcements and incongruous practices of international actors. While analysing the cases of China and the European Union, we point out contradictions stemming from their policy goals guided by strategic interests. From a global climate justice perspective, we analyze recent power dynamics that operate at two levels: first, economic relations and negotiations between Brazil and the two poles of power, considering the scenario of socio-environmental injustice and climate insecurity; second, policy practices of both global players in climate governance, bearing in mind the notions of climate justice and development as conceptual guides to understand when and where contradictions emerge. To do so, this article is structured around three sections: (i) a brief historical account of China’s and the EU’s roles in international climate policy; (ii) their legacies in climate governance and the inextricable relationship between their normative behaviour and their development objectives; (iii) an overview of the signing of the strategic memorandum of understanding for economic and trade agreement between Mercosur and the EU in 2019, as well as Sino-Brazilian relations facilitating investments and trade in multiple segments vis-à-vis the most recent multifaceted backlash in Brazil’s socio-environmental and climate policies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
> 10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106353,The protective role of mangroves in safeguarding coastal populations through hazard risk reduction: A case study in northeast Brazil,"Coastal and estuarine ecosystems such as mangroves provide coastal protection services, safeguarding coastal communities and economies. However, sea-level rise can affect mangroves' protective role by increasing exposure to coastal hazards and economic costs. To better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sea-level rise, we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosion/accretion rates on the shoreline. We assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves. Finally, we estimated the economic losses and costs from the long-term retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss. This study was carried out along the western coast of the South Atlantic, in the northeast Brazilian region. Coastal exposure indices were estimated using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software, and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. Finally, the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building. The results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030. In terms of the value of property loss, this translates to US$38,800 and would increase to US$72,000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario. Based on our coastal vulnerability assessment, almost 50 km of the coastline (20%) would transition to intermediate-high exposure levels if the current distribution of mangroves were to be lost. It is expected to cost about US$145 million in rockfill works and US$21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sea-level rise on mangroves ecosystem services. At the national level, a total loss of mangroves in Brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly US$4000 million. More robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystem-service co-benefits they provide. The latter is essential in low- and middle-income nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and well-being. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
> 10.1016/j.rser.2022.112860,When being renewable may not be enough: Typologies of trends in energy and carbon footprint towards sustainable development,"Renewable energy has been encouraged to address climate change and promote sustainable development, leading to structural changes in the national energy matrices. Brazil is reaching a 50/50 renewable/non-renewable energy mix. However, the wide variability in emissions intensity among renewable sources raises questions about the effectiveness of structural changes for SDGs. The present study aims to identify typological profiles (TPs) of structural changes in sectoral energy and carbon footprint and their contributions to sustainable development. From an ecological input-output model, we calculated the sectoral energy and carbon footprint for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The method adds novelty by creating typologies of structural changes confronting renewable vs. non-renewable and mainly renewable vs. renewable. Four TPs of structural change were found. TP-I and TP-II tended to increase the relative share of renewables in their energy footprint, opposing TP-III and TP-IV. A controversy emerged contrasting TP-I and TP-II since both increased renewable consumption. TP-I decreased the renewable emissions while TP-II increased them. The explanation lies in the energy sources’ emissions intensity. While TP-I sectors tended to increase the consumption of renewable energies with low intensity of emissions, such as electricity, TP-II sectors increased the consumption of renewables whose gross emissions intensity could be even higher than non-renewables. Therefore, the simple substitution of non-renewable for renewable sources may not be enough. Pursuing the long-term sustainable structural changes need to be planned based on renewable sources with the lowest net emission intensity and highest renewability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Core to the environmental risk and security issues is the greenhouse gas emission which reflects carbon dioxide emissions effect on global climate. In order to better understand this stuff, the study explored the combined effect of increasing railway transport, air transport and urbanisation on the environment in emerging economies from 1995 to 2016. The study employed the Pesaran CD, average mean group (AMG), correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) and cointegration test approach. The study revealed that rail transport and urban population show good statistical strength to improve the environment. Findings from the study indicate that the proliferation of the emerging economies such as India, China, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and Russia has greatly contributed to the growth of environmental sustainability. There is a lot of policy blueprint mentioned in this study, in which when adhere to could provide pertinent decision advocate in building quality environmental economies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The apparent consumption of this type of paper from 1961 to 2016, calculated from the data of the FAOSTAT system, was used to estimate the amount of waste disposed of annually in three site categories: sanitary landfill, controlled dump, and open-air, uncontrolled dump. The 2006 IPCC Guide methodology was used to calculate CH4 emissions and long-term carbon storage. Nine scenarios based upon the law that establishes the National Solid Waste Policy (NSWP) were examined, considering 100% waste disposal and treatment in landfills or incineration from 2014. The total emission was estimated at 1.967 MtCH4, corresponding to 55.080 MtCO2eq by GWP-AR5, and the stored carbon at 3.724 Mt, corresponding to 13.655 MtCO2eq. CH4emission increased beyond the population growth rate due to an increase in the per capita paper consumption in the country, from 0.02 kgCH4.year-1 in 1961 to 0.30 kg CH4.year-1 in 2016. The NSWP has not yet been accomplished, and the scenarios outlined indicate that, from the point of view of CH4 emissions, it would be more advantageous to carry out incineration instead of applying other waste treatment technologies. © 2022 Universidade Federal do Parana.

> 10.1080/14693062.2022.2074351,Capacity building as the cornerstone of the climate change regime: evolution of the agenda through a policy-practitioner view from Brazil,"As developing economies walk a tightrope balancing economic development with environmental protection, capacity building becomes the most prominent instrument to ensure that the development needs of citizens are met within the realities of the climate change regime. Capacity building sits at the very foundation of the climate change regime, together with ‘finance’ and ‘technology development and transfer’ mechanisms. Recognizing that developing countries are on the receiving end of implementation projects, this review highlights historical understanding of the constituents of capacity building initiatives and how these can advance humanity towards the global good of decelerating, and even reversing, the adverse impacts of climate change. In particular, the article describes the institutionalization of capacity building since the establishment of the international climate change regime and highlights some of the stances of the Brazilian environmental diplomacy in this process. Furthermore, it emphasizes initiatives taken by developing countries to empower their citizens and to serve as a mainstay for enhancing South–South cooperation by sharing climate-friendly practices and capabilities. With the establishment of the Paris Committee on Capacity Building and Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency at COP21, it is clear that ‘clarity’ and ‘tracking of progress’ are the new objective tools needed to build on and supplement NDCs and related national efforts for tackling climate change. Key policy insights Capacity development projects should be tailored to the characteristics and needs of each recipient Non-Annex I country. Effective and lasting development of capabilities requires going beyond imparting technical know-how of environmentally-beneficial technologies and must include adopting a ‘learning by doing’ approach. National institutions of the recipient countries should be at the helm of capacity building projects to bring in necessary knowledge on national regulations, traditional skills, and resources that are vital to the success of these initiatives. Transparency in information flow and timely multistakeholder assessment of capacity building efforts are the lynchpin for enduring capacity development efforts. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
> 10.1080/14693062.2022.2116381,The green transition in emerging economies: green bond issuance in Brazil and China,"Green bonds have emerged as an innovative financial instrument that may be used to mobilise incremental resources for long-term financing projects focused on building sustainable infrastructure. In this regard, this article advances research on green bond markets in emerging economies (EEs) by comparing the evolution of the certified green bonds markets in Brazil and China. For this purpose, a mixed analysis was applied. The qualitative analysis is based on a literature review to contextualise the main drivers and barriers to the evolution of the green bond market in light of national policies and features of the financial system in each country. For the quantitative analysis, the certified green bond markets are assessed in terms of the amounts issued as a percentage of the debt securities markets, considering the participation of each issuer type and the allocation of revenue across eligible sectors. Information on certified green bond amounts issued and on debt securities’ markets was obtained from the Climate Bonds Initiative and BIS databases. The results show that the evolution of the Chinese and Brazilian certified green bonds markets remains negligible, in terms of the whole debt securities market. Although green bonds may be considered an important market solution, they still do not provide sufficient resources necessary for a meaningful green transition, especially in EEs. However, findings also show that in China, compared to Brazil, features of the financial system combine with more consolidated green policies to act in favour of scaling up and distributing revenue to crucial sectors to green transition. Key policy insights: Without well-coordinated national green policies and appropriated institutional arrangements, the growth of the debt securities market in emerging economies (EEs) will not boost the certified green bond market. In EEs, notably in Brazil and China, the central government’s influence on the policy coordination and the financial system is fundamental in achieving green goals. Greater participation of state-owned financial institutions in EEs could improve the access to finance more emergent solutions (e.g. low carbon transport, water infrastructure, etc.) beyond more mature ones (the usual solar and wind energy) to promote the green transition. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
> 10.3390/catal11121549,Thermochemical and catalytic conversion technologies for the development of Brazilian biomass utilization,"The social, economic, and environmental impacts of climate change have been shown to affect poorer populations throughout the world disproportionally, and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020–2021 has only exacerbated the use of less sustainable energy, fuel, and chemical sources. The period of economic and social recovery following the pandemic presents an unprecedented opportunity to invest in biorefineries based on the pyrolysis of agricultural residues. These produce a plethora of sustainable resources while also contributing to the economic valorization of first-sector local economies. However, biomass-derived pyrolysis liquid is highly oxygenated, which hinders its long-term stability and usability. Catalytic hydrogenation is a proposed upgrading method to reduce this hindrance, while recent studies on the use of nickel and niobium as low-cost catalysts, both abundant in Brazil, reinforce the potential synergy between different economic sectors within the country. This review gathers state-of-the-art applications of these technologies with the intent to guide the scientific community and lawmakers alike on yet another alternative for energy and commodities production within an environmentally sustainable paradigm. © 2021 by the authors.

> 10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101275,A real options framework for reducing emissions from deforestation: Reconciling short-term incentives with long-term benefits from conservation and agricultural intensification,"Tropical forests provide enormous ecological and economic value. The potential is rapidly growing for carbon markets to deliver private and public compensation for emissions reductions from forest protection at national and subnational scales. Nevertheless, monetization of forest ecosystem services remains scant, leaving forests vulnerable to conversion to other land uses in the short run. We develop a real options framework for a representative farmer's land-use decisions, identifying a value gap between private short-term incentives versus long-term benefits from carbon market compensation, given uncertainties over future values for emissions reductions from forest protection. A quantitative illustration of this framework for Mato Grosso, Brazil, demonstrates that forest conservation coupled with cattle ranching intensification is competitive with the predominant practice of extensive cattle production, but is hindered by landholders’ perceptions of the relative option values to different land uses. We show how bonds, call and put options allow for early monetization of part of potential future carbon revenues, even under uncertainty, changing incentives at the landholder level and jumpstarting conservation and more efficient models of agricultural production. These approaches provide a model for addressing the financial needs of farmers on the ground to accelerate the transition towards low-deforestation rural development at large scales. © 2021"

Modelling tools are needed to help understand the range of possible outcomes due to these ‘telecoupled’ global-to-local relationships, given future political, economic and environmental uncertainties. Here, we present CRAFTY-Brazil, a LUCC model representing production of multiple agricultural commodities that accounts for spatially explicit (e.g., land access) and temporally contingent (e.g., agricultural debt) processes of importance across our nearly four million km2 Brazilian study area. We calibrate the model calibration for 2001–2018, and run tests and scenarios about commodity demand, agricultural yields, climate change, and policy decisions for 2019–2035. Results indicate greater confidence in modelled time-series than spatial allocation. We discuss how our approach might be best understood to be agency-based, rather than agent-based, and highlight questions more and less appropriate for this approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
> 10.1016/B978-0-323-85250-0.00014-1,The institutional approach of climate change at the multinational level: The new paradigm of the Brazilian legislative experience,"For just over 30 years (specifically, since 1988, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, was created), climate change has been an important research issue. This is a result of a series of international climate treaties and related multilateral negotiation processes that have been kept among countries. Brazil has participated in all these processes since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was drafted, in 1992, during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development; and, ultimately, became a signatory of all the main correlated treaties. This chapter investigates the domestic impact of such treaties, and how a relevant part of Brazilian laws is related to this climate-protection theme. In this context, the chapter also discusses the national powers and competences of the Federative Republic of Brazil regarding the different sectors and economic activities embedded within the climate change treaties, in general, addressed to the mitigation of this global environmental problem. The methodology used is the descriptive-analytical one, with the analysis of international treaties, official history of negotiations, and official documents of the main climate-related treaties, including the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, developed during the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015. The results specify the effective administrative and legislative attributions of the federated entities bringing light to the institutional roles regarding the implementation of the Brazilian commitments established by its National Determined Contribution under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The focus is on the interactions of national and subnational level spheres of power, namely, the Federal Union, states, and local governments, considering the Sustainable Development Goals and how this institutional approach based on three spheres of power is unprecedented. Therefore our contribution is a discussion on the Brazilian institutional structure for implementing climate change policies and stakeholders in the process. The findings conclude how the Brazilian experience may be of interest to other countries in the world, regardless of their form of government and stage of development. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

> 10.3390/math8122217,"Greening the financial system in USA, Canada and brazil: A panel data analysis","Each country designs its own scheme to achieve green financing and, in general, credit is considered to be a fundamental source of greening financial systems. The novelty of this study resides in that we examined green financing initiatives in USA, Canada and Brazil by focusing on major components of the financial systems before, during and after the 2008 world financial crisis. By means of panel data analysis conducted on observations ranging across the period 1970–2018, we investigated variables such as domestic credit from banks, domestic credit from the financial sector, GDP, N2O emissions, CO2 emissions and the value added from agriculture, forest and fishing activities. According to our findings, domestic credit from banks was insufficient to achieve green financing. Namely, in order to increase economic growth while reducing global warming and climate change, the financial sector should assume a bigger role in funding green investments. Moreover, our results showed that domestic credit from the financial sector contributed to green financing, while CO2 emissions remained a challenge in capping global warming at the 1.5◦C level.

In recent years, the Brazilian presidential elections in 2018 and the recovery from one of the nation's worst economic recessions defined a political scenario that has been causing shifts in the patterns of land cover change. A variety of national plans for the near-future exist and include the construction of new roads connecting remote Amazonian areas and large dams that could flood up to 10 million hectares. These development plans threaten environmental conservation, but the potential effects on the local or regional land cover are mostly unknown. In this work, we construct a model to evaluate the possible consequences of policy actions on land cover dynamics in the near-future at a high-resolution scale. The regression model extracts the historical relationships between land cover and spatial drivers of change, and its extrapolation for the future enables the simulation of scenarios for the national plans currently discussed in Brazil. We also simulate three scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which makes contrasting management assumptions. The resulting maps indicate that considerable changes in land cover composition and configuration may occur even in a short period. The historical Brazilian economic forces make the decrease in natural vegetation probabilities challenging to stop even in an environmentally oriented scenario, where plans for the construction of new infrastructure are abruptly interrupted. Our results also indicate that environmental degradation cannot be prevented without coordinated efforts between public agencies with a broad diversity of development viewpoints. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

The rapid and cluttered development of mining in the Brazilian Amazonia is historically related to local economic collapse, besides representing a global environmental risk. Here we bring a historical perspective of human activities in the Brazilian Amazonia, focusing on mining activities to discuss how it can threaten Amazonia's integrity, leading to negative consequences to biodiversity, human populations, and the world climate system. We also highlight the role of indigenous lands on buffering the impacts of human-induced environmental threats, which depends on government actions toward sustainable policies rather than inadequate environmental regulation aiming short term profits. Finally, we suggest the sustainable use of forest resources through the emission of green bonds, which may represent the best alternative to avoid the Amazonia depletion while allowing Brazilian economic growth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

This novel approach analyzes climate extreme events over the past four decades (1980–2016) using multiple gridded observation and reanalysis datasets. Furthermore, future changes in climate extremes are analyzed from 20 downscaled Earth System Models (ESMs) at high horizontal resolution (0.25° of latitude/longitude), under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in the extreme indices are analyzed over mid-twenty-first century (2046–2065) and end-of-twenty-first century (2081–2100) relative to the reference period 1986–2005. Results show consistent warming patterns with increasing (decreasing) trends in warm (cold) extremes in the historical datasets. A similar but more intense warm pattern is projected in the mid and end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation indices, observations show an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction of consecutive wet days over almost all Brazil. The frequency and intensity of extremely wet days over Brazil are expected to increase according to future scenarios. Designing effective adaptation and mitigation measures in response to changes in climate extremes events depends on this improved understanding of how conditions have and are likely to change in the future at regional scales. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, many regions suffer from shortage of both meteorological monitoring stations and historical information on ETo. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a daily gridded reference evapotranspiration data set for Brazil that matches the period and grid cells of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data. ETo was calculated using data from 849 weather stations over the period from 1 June 2000 to 31 December 2018. The features used to model ETo were the GPM daily data set, WorldClim averages monthly, and two engineered features. Among the machine learning algorithms assessed, the Cubist presented the best performance-computation cost trade-off in a subset of the entire data and, therefore, was selected to model ETo daily. The developed data set presented root mean square error of 0.65 mm day−1, or 16% lower than previous ETo data set developed for Brazil using interpolation techniques. The GPM and engineered features showed higher importance for the models trained during the wet season, while the WorldClim maximum temperature averages monthly were more important during the dry and cold season.

Four months after the first report, the oil has already been found along >3000 km of the Brazilian coastline on >980 beaches and was recently observed along the Amazon coast, making this oil spill the most extensive and severe environmental disaster ever recorded in Brazilian history, in the South Atlantic basin, and in tropical coastal regions worldwide. Four features of this oil-spill disaster make it unique: 1) the characteristics of the oil spill; 2) the characteristics of the affected region in tropical Brazil; 3) the significant number of protected areas (>55) and tropical ecosystems affected by the oil; and 4) the absence of measures and/or flaws in the measures taken by the federal government to address this environmental and social emergency. The affected species and poor human communities in Brazil should receive focused attention in the coming decades owing to the long-term impacts of the oil contamination. Environmental monitoring and response measures must be implemented to minimize the ecological, economic, and social effects of the spill. Biodiversity and climate regulation losses considering blue carbon environments should drive discussions regarding mining accidents and global consequences related to pre-salt oil exploitation, new spill events, and their global impacts. These measures are particularly relevant in areas with high tropical biodiversity and high social inequality, as in the present case, which represents one of the worst-case scenarios of an environmental and governmental disaster. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Thus, the analyses proposed by this study aimed at identifying the impact of climate change on naturalised streamflows and Affluent Natural Energy (NEA) projections for the Brazilian electricity sector using six models of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project, based on the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the 21st century. The streamflows for the 24 stations representing the National Interconnected System (NIS) were estimated through the concentrated hydrological model SMAP (Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure), while the streamflows for the other stations that comprise the NIS were obtained by linear regression. The streamflows, as well as the productivity of the reservoirs, were used to calculate the NEA. The results showed that most of the models project possible reductions in annual naturalized streamflows and NEA for the three periods analyzed and for the North, Northeast and Southeast/Midwest sectors. Meanwhile, in the Southern sector, for the period 2010-2039, most of the models indicated an increase in the annual naturalized streamflows and NEA. © 2020, Brazilian Journal of Water Resources.

This paper seeks to verify the economic impacts of climate change in the Legal Amazon region, especially on agricultural production, land use, GDP and job creation. We employ the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, REGIA - Inter-regional General Equilibrium Model for the Brazilian Legal Amazon, to assess changes in agricultural production and land use in the region due to climate change scenarios proposed by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The results indicate a drop in economic indicators in the Legal Amazon leading to a loss in real GDP in the order of 1.18% in 2049 due to decrease in production and employment in the agricultural sector. Deforestation will increase due to the gradual replacement of pasture areas by crop fields. Such changes are not homogeneous in the space, affecting more the states of Mato Grosso, Tocantins and Pará, whose economy are dependent upon agriculture. © 2020 The Authors"

The most-needed substantial upscaling of investments in GHG mitigation options in all sectors, and particularly in manufacturing sectors, can be an opportunity for a green economic development leap in developing countries. Here, we use the Brazilian manufacturing sectors as an example to explore a transformation of its economy while contributing to the Paris targets. Projections of Brazil's economic futures with and without a portfolio of fiscal policies to induce low carbon investments are produced up to 2030 (end year of Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution-NDC), by employing the large-scale macro econometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model, E3ME. Our findings highlight that the correct mix of green stimulus can help modernize and decarbonize the Brazilian manufacturing sectors and allow the country's economy to grow faster (by up to 0.42% compared to baseline) while its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decline (by up to 14.5% in relation to baseline). Investment levels increase, thereby strengthening exports' competitiveness and alleviating external constraints to long-term economic growth in net terms. © 2019 by the authors."

It points out a set of conjuncture factors that allow us to foresee a new paradigm of sustainable development for the region by transforming the sun’s radiant energy into electricity through distributed photovoltaic generation. The new paradigm, as presented in this essay, has the transformative potential to free the region from past regional development dogma, which was dependent on the scarce water resource, and the marginal and predatory use of its Caatinga Biome. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a pre ante design, following the procedures of scenario building, as an adaptation mechanism to climate change in the sector of energy generation and socioeconomic inclusion. Findings: The scenarios of socioeconomic resilience to climate change based on the abundance of solar radiation, rather than the scarcity of water, demonstrates its potential as a global adaptation paradigm to climate change. Research limitations/implications: The developments proposed are dependent on federal legislation changes, allowing the small producer to be remunerated by the energy produced. Practical implications: The proposed smart grid photovoltaic generation program increases the country's resiliency to the effect of droughts and climate change. Social implications: As proposed, the program allows for the reversion of a pattern of long term poverty in semi-arid Northeast Brazil. Originality/value: The exploitation of the characteristics of abundance of the semiarid climate, i.e. its very condition of semi-aridity with abundant solar radiation, is itself an advantage factor toward adaption to unforeseen drought events. Extensive previous research has focused on weighting and monitoring drought i.e. the paradigm of scarcity. The interplay between exploiting Northeast Brazil’s abundant factors and climate change adaptation, especially at the small farmer levels constitutes a discovery never before contemplated. © 2019, Paulo Nobre, Enio Bueno Pereira, Francinete Francis Lacerda, Marcel Bursztyn, Eduardo Amaral Haddad and Debora Ley."

However, the increasing population and the extraction of natural resources challenge forest governance. This paper assesses the historical evolution of the policy narratives that have driven environmental governance in Brazil. We argue that environmental policy has evolved through an overlapping of narratives, rather than a change in governance logics. The success of REDD+ relies not only on the soundness of its scientific base but also on its interaction with existing narratives, the susceptibility of policies to economic and political changes at the national and international level and the mechanisms of social exclusion it may reinforce. © 2018 BioOne.

This can be achieved through the cascading use of biomass, which also offers the potential of creating additional value from biomass by developing novel products. Taking sugarcane as a case study example, this paper aims to analyze how well Brazil, the world's leader in sugarcane production, is positioned to reach these goals. The paper combines two conceptual tools: one is the ‘biomass-based value web’, which was developed as an extension of the value chain concept with the aim to capture the links within and between value chains that arise from the cascading and joined use of biomass. The other concept is that of the ‘national innovation system’ (NIS), which serves to identify the different types of actors involved in the biomass value web and the linkages between them. For empirical data collection, the study combined three methods: a mapping of the physical biomass flows in the value web, in-depth interviews with the actors involved, and the application of the ‘Net-Map’ tool to identify the actors in the NIS and their linkages. The findings show that the development of Brazil's international competitiveness in sugar and ethanol was based on political incentives that resulted in a strong network of institutions that focused on these two products. However, to become a front-runner in the future bioeconomy, the existing innovation network needs to be expanded. In particular, it is important to integrate national and international private sector organizations. The findings also suggest that industries need stronger incentives to collaborate with knowledge institutions. Long-term consistent policies and funding opportunities for risky investments are also required to further strengthen Brazil's innovation network to meet future opportunities and challenges of the bioeconomy. © 2017 The Authors"

Most of the plants are concentrated in the southeast region, where the largest consumers and the largest population concentration are located. The expansion of this system, considering the hydroelectric contributions, will occur exploring the potentials located in the Amazon region. This analysis paper shows that the variations imposed by climate changes on some climatological variables create significant uncertainties about the power generation forecasts of the hydroelectric power plants to be installed in the Amazon, thus compromising the financial economic feasibility of these enterprises and also possibly compromising the expansion plans of the Brazilian energy system. The methodological approach uses information from various climate change scenarios and compares those with historical hydrological patterns and generation information. By exploring the characteristics of a large-scale hydrothermal system with high dependence on water resources, this paper provides valuable insights on how energy policy would address hydroelectric vulnerabilities and climate change. This analysis is focused on the Brazilian case but reveals important issues related to systems with hydro thermal characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Brazil is a world leader in the use of conventional renewable energy sources, such as hydro power, while Germany has been achieving outstanding results in fostering NCRES. The focus is on two critical issues: the legal and regulatory framework and the institutions created to support the NCRES market development. The comparison shows that, despite the very different energy situations and policy drivers, valuables lessons can be extracted from the German experience. The main lesson for Brazil is to think NCRES as a strategic opportunity to rely less on fossil fuel and large hydroelectric power plants, to decentralize the electric power sector, to use the huge solar, biomass and wind power potential available in the country and to create a environment-friendly NCRES industry. To this end, three critical points were identified: (1) the legal and regulatory framework should be improved; (2) long-term energy planning taking into account social, economic and climate issues and; (3) the current institutions supporting NCRES in Brazil should be upgraded and/or new ones, such as more specific energy agencies, should be created. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."
> 10.1371/journal.pone.0152311,Brazil's market for trading forest certificates,"Brazil faces an enormous challenge to implement its revised Forest Code. Despite big losses for the environment, the law introduces new mechanisms to facilitate compliance and foster payment for ecosystem services (PES). The most promising of these is a market for trading forest certificates (CRAs) that allows landowners to offset their restoration obligations by paying for maintaining native vegetation elsewhere. We analyzed the economic potential for the emerging CRA market in Brazil and its implications for PES programs. Results indicate a potential market for trading 4.2 Mha of CRAs with a gross value of US$ 9.2±2.4 billion, with main regional markets forming in the states of Mato Grosso and Sâo Paulo. This would be the largest market for trading forests in the world. Overall, the potential supply of CRAs in Brazilian states exceeds demand, creating an opportunity for additional PES programs to use the CRA market. This expanded market could provide not only monetary incentives to conserve native vegetation, but also environmental co-benefits by fostering PES programs focused on biodiversity, water conservation, and climate regulation. Effective implementation of the Forest Code will be vital to the success of this market and this hurdle brings uncertainty into the market. Long-term commitment, both within Brazil and abroad, will be essential to overcome the many challenges ahead. © 2016 Soares-Filho et al.

This is done by first calibrating an econometric model for electricity demand on historical data, and subsequently applying the model to a large number of simulated weather paths, together with projections for the remaining determinants. Simulated weather paths are generated based on output from a global circulation model, using a method that preserves the trend and annual seasonality of the first and second moments, as well as the spatial and serial correlations. The application of the framework is demonstrated by creating long-term, probabilistic electricity demand forecasts for Brazil for the period 2016-2100 that incorporates weather uncertainty for three climate change scenarios. All three scenarios indicate steady growth in annual average electricity demand until reaching a peak of approximately 1071-1200 TWh in 2060, then subsequently a decline, largely reflecting the trajectory of the population projections. The weather uncertainty in all scenarios is significant, with up to 400 TWh separating the 10th and the 90th percentiles, or approximately ±17% relative to the mean. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

We find that Brazil's commitments will be met through reduced deforestation, and at no additional cost; however, Mexico's pledges will cost 4 billion US dollars in terms of reduced GDP in 2020. We explore short- and long-term implications of several policy scenarios after 2020, considering current policy debates in both countries. The comparative analysis of these two economies underscores the need for climate policy designed for the specific characteristics of each country, accounting for variables such as natural resources and current economic structure.

Theorizing the interactions between political economies and their related natural environments, in terms of both finitudes of resources and generation of greenhouse gases, presents a major challenge to social sciences. Approaches from classical political economy, transition theory, economic geography, and political ecology, are reviewed before elaborating the neo-Polanyian approach adopted here. The case of Brazil, analysed with an ‘instituted economic process’ framework, demonstrates how the trilemma is a spatial and historical socio-economic phenomenon, varying significantly in its dynamics in different environmental and resource contexts.

Its energy mix makes Brazil one of the least energy-related carbon-intensive economies worldwide. Given that the country is fast becoming one of the world's economic powerhouses, decision-makers need to understand the drivers underlying past and current carbon dioxide emissions trends. We therefore investigate a) which key long-term drivers have led to Brazil's unique emissions profile, and b) the implications of these drivers for Brazil's national policies. We show that Brazil's emissions are growing mainly due to increasing individual standards of living, exports and population size, and that this growth is so far unchallenged by technological and structural improvements toward lower emissions intensities and more efficient production structures. As these trends are likely to continue amidst growing international pressure on key economies to reduce their carbon emissions, a decoupling of drivers from emissions is needed to simultaneously meet development and environmental goals. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

We developed a treatment effects model, based in the Propensity Score Matching technique, which can explain irrigation adoption and net revenues simultaneously. Temperature and precipitation projections for 2010-2099 were used considering different climate scenarios according to the 4th Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Results confirmed the efficiency of irrigation as an adaptive strategy. For all simulation scenarios, land values of irrigators are, on average, approximately twice the value of rainfed smallholders. It can be concluded that there is need of public policies focused on developing strategies to cope with global warming effects in the agricultural sector. Moreover, given the importance of irrigation adoption as an adaptive measure, it is needed to encourage the expansion of credit lines for irrigation investments, especially for less capitalized farmers."

The Northeastern region showed the highest decrease in the low-risk area for cotton cultivation due to the projected temperature increase. This area in the Brazilian Northeast may decrease from 83 million ha in 2010 to approximately 71 million ha in 2040, which means 15% reduction in 30 years. Southeastern and Center-Western regions had small decrease in areas suitable for cotton production until 2040, while the Northern region showed no reduction in these areas.

Since 1990, land-use change has been the most important source of GHG emissions in the country. The voluntary goals to limit Brazilian GHG emissions pledged a reduction in between 36.1% and 38.9% of GHG emissions projected to 2020, to be 6-10% lower than in 2005. Brazil is in a good position to meet the voluntary mitigation goals pledged to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) up to 2020: recent efforts to reduce deforestation have been successful and avoided deforestation will form the bulk of the emissions reduction commitment. In 2020, if governmental mitigation goals are met, then GHG emissions from the energy system would become the largest in the country. After 2020, if no additional mitigation actions are implemented, GHG emissions will increase again in the period 2020-2030, due to population and economic growth driving energy demand, supply and GHG emissions. However, Brazil is in a strong position to take a lead in low-carbon economic and social development due to its huge endowment of renewable energy resources allowing for additional mitigation actions to be adopted after 2020. Policy relevance The period beyond 2020 is now relevant in climate policy due to the Durban Platform agreeing a 'protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force' that will have effect from 2020. After 2020, Brazil will be in a situation more similar to other industrialized countries, faced with a new challenge of economic development with low GHG energy-related emissions, requiring the adoption of mitigation policies and measures targeted at the energy system. Unlike the mitigation actions in the land-use change sector, where most of the funding will come from the national budgets due to sovereignty concerns, the huge financial resources needed to develop low-carbon transport and energy infrastructure could benefit from soft loans channelled to the country through nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs). © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

We highlight the main differences between the hand-production and fully automated mechanical manufacturing in the Brazilian ethanol industry and examine the historical, political, and economic factors that induced this regional technology gap that is currently observed. We then construct an environmental model based on a 375-industry interregional input-output system for the Brazilian regions, in order to determine the extent to which the primitive ethanol production of Northern Brazil differs from the automated manufacture technologies of the South in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. We show that ethanol produced with modern technologies generates lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than ethanol produced with traditional production processes. We also demonstrate that ethanol, regardless of the technology with which it was produced, is more carbon-efficient than petrochemical products. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

One of the most significant ways it will be impacted is through changing water availability: Brazil's ability to supply water to its people for domestic use and economic activity will be affected by its response to water conditions, deforestation, and growth. Brazil's policies in relation to climate change, water and deforestation will likely have a significant impact on Brazil's water supply in the long-term. This paper examines several of the challenges facing Brazil's water and forestry polices, with focus on the effects of climate change, societal forces, and deforestation on the robustness of Brazilian policy. It also analyzes some of the structural advantages and deficiencies facing policymakers. Brazil's policy decisions will have economically and climatologically impacts worldwide and Brazil will face international pressure and internal need to manage its resources wisely. © 2011 ASCE."

Projects for carbon capture and disposal in coal seams and depleted oilfields have important economic benefits, ­significantly enhancing gas and oil productivity through enhanced coalbed methane and enhanced oil recovery, respectively. In Brazil and South America as a whole, saline aquifers have the greatest storage capacity and thus the greatest potential for CO2 disposal. Despite the costs of CO2 capture, transport, injection and monitoring in saline aquifers (at present, without direct financial returns), these projects protect the atmosphere by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Disposal of RW in deep geological repositories raises the environmental protection issue of preventing RW from nuclear power plants from causing underground (deep aquifers) and surface contamination. In both CO2 and RW disposal, the long-term (millennial) safety of underground isolation in deep geological repositories must be assured. Thus, in selecting geological sites for permanent CO2 and RW disposal, the following should be considered: (1) the occurrence of caprocks to prevent leakage; (2) the structural and geological context (stable regions without earthquake hazards); (3) the disposal capacity; and (4) the cost-efficiency of projects. The definition and characterization of disposal sites is a key question for the energy supply and the geopolitical and environmental security of all Latin American developing countries. The need for a clean diversified energy matrix in a regional context of economic growth, global warming and climate change must be agreed upon by governments and by the public. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

It presents an analysis of its introductory stage, from the first decades of the 20th century until the early 1970s, when, in a second stage, additional measures allowed for its consolidation and maturity, under the widely known Proalcool. The paper presents a historical reinterpretation of the policies, mechanisms and instruments adopted in both stages, aiming to highlight the economical and political links. It is concluded that the interests of the agrarian elites, operating at the political level, and the fuel supply crisis during Second World War were basic during the first stage, to sustain a productive and logistic capacity and maintain ethanol alive as an automotive fuel. It is also concluded that the launching of Proalcool represented a transition combining the interests of the sugarcane agribusiness, burdened by the drop in sugar prices, and the need to equilibrate the balance of payments due to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Ethanol supply shocks harmed its credibility and its commercial consolidation was only possible through the introduction of flex-fuel vehicles with expectations strongly relying on climate change mitigation actions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To this aim, environmental external costs associated to both hydro-power and thermal-power electricity generation are investigated. Monetary valuation methodologies are applied and environmental degradation costs, expressed in per kWh of generated energy, are obtained for the main types of generation sources of the Brazilian electricity matrix. Both local pollution due to particulate matter emissions and global warming effects are assessed. A classification of the sources from the point of view of their impact on the environment is given. Degradation costs associated to the installed capacity expansion in the Brazilian electricity sector during the time horizon 2007-2016 are estimated. These resulting costs represent lower boundary damage estimates associated only with the energy to be generated during the period. Results indicate that local pollution caused by a small number of plants could be even more costly to society than global warming and, also, show the importance of considering not only unitary damage costs but the participation of each source on the generated energy during the time horizon, as a guide to planning and policy making. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationships between the climatic parameters and the agricultural production are quite complex, because environmental factors affect the growth and the development of the plants under different forms during the growth stages of the coffee crop. Agrometeorological models related to the growth, development and productivity can supply information for the soil water monitoring and yield forecast, based on the water stress. A soil water balance during different growth stages of the coffee crop, can quantify the effect of the available soil water on the decrease of the final yield. Other climatic factors can reduce the productivity, such as adverse air temperatures happened during different growth stages. Solar radiation and relative humidity influence many physiological processes of the coffee tree but are not generally thought to play an important role as thermal and rainfall conditions in defining potential yield or ecological limitations for this crop. According to the last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007), the global temperature is supposed to increase 1.1oC to 6.4oC and the rainfall 15% in the tropical areas of Brazil. Some Global warming projections as presented by IPCC will cause a strong decrease in the coffee production in Brazil. According to the literature besides the reduction of suitable areas for coffee production, the crop will tend to move South and uphill regions. This review article analyze the effect that these possible scenarios would have in the agro-climatic coffee zoning in Brazil, and adaptive solutions, such as agronomic mitigations and development of cultivars adapted to high temperatures is considered."

This is done by first calibrating an econometric model for electricity demand on historical data, and subsequently applying the model to a large number of simulated weather paths, together with projections for the remaining determinants. Simulated weather paths are generated based on output from a global circulation model, using a method that preserves the trend and annual seasonality of the first and second moments, as well as the spatial and serial correlations. The application of the framework is demonstrated by creating long-term, probabilistic electricity demand forecasts for Brazil for the period 2016-2100 that incorporates weather uncertainty for three climate change scenarios. All three scenarios indicate steady growth in annual average electricity demand until reaching a peak of approximately 1071-1200 TWh in 2060, then subsequently a decline, largely reflecting the trajectory of the population projections. The weather uncertainty in all scenarios is significant, with up to 400 TWh separating the 10th and the 90th percentiles, or approximately +/- 17% relative to the mean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The novelty of this study resides in that we examined green financing initiatives in USA, Canada and Brazil by focusing on major components of the financial systems before, during and after the 2008 world financial crisis. By means of panel data analysis conducted on observations ranging across the period 1970-2018, we investigated variables such as domestic credit from banks, domestic credit from the financial sector, GDP, N2O emissions, CO2 emissions and the value added from agriculture, forest and fishing activities. According to our findings, domestic credit from banks was insufficient to achieve green financing. Namely, in order to increase economic growth while reducing global warming and climate change, the financial sector should assume a bigger role in funding green investments. Moreover, our results showed that domestic credit from the financial sector contributed to green financing, while CO2 emissions remained a challenge in capping global warming at the 1.5 degrees C level. Our empirical study supports the idea that economic growth together with policies targeting climate change and global warming can contribute to green financing. Over and above that, governments should strive to design sustainable fiscal and monetary policies that promote green financing."

The Northeastern region showed the highest decrease in the low-risk area for cotton cultivation due to the projected temperature increase. This area in the Brazilian Northeast may decrease from 83 million ha in 2010 to approximately 71 million ha in 2040, which means 15% reduction in 30 years. Southeastern and Center-Western regions had small decrease in areas suitable for cotton production until 2040, while the Northern region showed no reduction in these areas. Temperature increase will not benefit cotton cultivation in Brazil because dimension of low-risk areas for economic cotton production may decrease."

However, climate change and extremes affect quality and production, challenging the Sustainable Development Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty. Extreme weather events generate economic and social costs, driving the use of adaptation strategies, with rural insurance being one of the main instruments to manage these risks. This study analyzes the impact of extreme weather events on rural insurance contracting in Brazil, using daily precipitation and temperature data to calculate extreme weather indices and perform panel regressions. The analysis of Minimum Comparable Areas (MCAs) between 2006 and 2016 showed that events such as Frost and Hot Days significantly increased insurance contracting, especially in the South and Central-West regions. The results highlight the importance of extreme variables and the need to consider regional differences and insurance alternatives. Despite the importance of insurance, increasing financial unviability suggests the need for additional strategies, such as crop diversification, community solidarity, and conservation of agricultural practices."

The concentration of soybean growing regions in the Americas renders the supply chain vulnerable to regional disruptions. In 2012, anomalous hot and dry conditions occurring simultaneously in these regions led to low soybean yields, which drove global soybean prices to all-time records. In this study, we explore climate change impacts on simultaneous extreme crop failures as the one from 2012. We develop a hybrid model, coupling a process-based crop model with a machine learning model, to improve the simulation of soybean production. We assess the frequency and magnitude of events with similar or higher impacts than 2012 under different future scenarios, evaluating anomalies both with respect to present day and future conditions to disentangle the impacts of (changing) climate variability from the long-term mean trends. We find long-term trends in mean climate increase the frequency of 2012 analogs by 11-16 times and the magnitude by 4-15% compared to changes in climate variability only depending on the global climate scenario. Conversely, anomalies like the 2012 event due to changes in climate variability show an increase in frequency in each country individually, but not simultaneously across the Americas. We deduce that adaptation of the crop production practice to the long-term mean trends of climate change may considerably reduce the future risk of simultaneous soybean losses across the Americas."

We find that Brazil's commitments will be met through reduced deforestation, and at no additional cost; however, Mexico's pledges will cost 4 billion US dollars in terms of reduced GDP in 2020. We explore short and long-term implications of several policy scenarios after 2020, considering current policy debates in both countries. The comparative analysis of these two economies underscores the need for climate policy designed for the specific characteristics of each country, accounting for variables such as natural resources and current economic structure.

This novel approach analyzes climate extreme events over the past four decades (1980-2016) using multiple gridded observation and reanalysis datasets. Furthermore, future changes in climate extremes are analyzed from 20 downscaled Earth System Models (ESMs) at high horizontal resolution (0.25 degrees of latitude/longitude), under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in the extreme indices are analyzed over mid-twenty-first century (2046-2065) and end-of-twenty-first century (2081-2100) relative to the reference period 1986-2005. Results show consistent warming patterns with increasing (decreasing) trends in warm (cold) extremes in the historical datasets. A similar but more intense warm pattern is projected in the mid and end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation indices, observations show an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction of consecutive wet days over almost all Brazil. The frequency and intensity of extremely wet days over Brazil are expected to increase according to future scenarios. Designing effective adaptation and mitigation measures in response to changes in climate extremes events depends on this improved understanding of how conditions have and are likely to change in the future at regional scales."

It contributes substantially to the livelihoods of millions of small producers worldwide. Coffea canephora represents 40% of the world's production of beans. Coffea canephora is a perennial crop, it is sensitive to climate, and several production areas in Brazil may become unfit for C. canephora cultivation due to expected climate change. Thus, knowledge of the temporal dynamics of favorable climate conditions for C. canephora in Brazil is necessary. This work aims to elaborate the CLIMEX model to predict the climatic suitability for C. canephora in Brazil in the current climate and front of climate changes for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100. The model shows a good agreement between the density and the growth rate of the species, which indicates significant reliability of the results in the proposed model. Our modeling results show that there has been a reduction in the areas very favorable to C. Canephora over the years, in the North, Southeast, and the entire east coast of the Northeast regions. Compared to the current scenario, the model projection reduces by 49, 73, 82, and 88% in 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100, respectively.

Theorizing the interactions between political economies and their related natural environments, in terms of both finitudes of resources and generation of greenhouse gases, presents a major challenge to social sciences. Approaches from classical political economy, transition theory, economic geography, and political ecology, are reviewed before elaborating the neo-Polanyian approach adopted here. The case of Brazil, analysed with an `instituted economic process' framework, demonstrates how the trilemma is a spatial and historical socio-economic phenomenon, varying significantly in its dynamics in different environmental and resource contexts.

In tropical ecosystems, regional climate projections and modeled ecosystem responses vary greatly, leading to a significant source of uncertainty in global biogeochemical accounting and possible future climate feedbacks. Here, we combine an ensemble of IPCC-AR4 climate change projections for the Amazon Basin (eight general circulation models) with alternative ecosystem parameter sets for the dynamic global vegetation model, LPJmL. We evaluate LPJmL simulations of carbon stocks and fluxes against flux tower and aboveground biomass datasets for individual sites and the entire basin. Variability in LPJmL model sensitivity to future climate change is primarily related to light and water limitations through biochemical and water-balance-related parameters. Temperature-dependent parameters related to plant respiration and photosynthesis appear to be less important than vegetation dynamics (and their parameters) for determining the magnitude of ecosystem response to climate change. Variance partitioning approaches reveal that relationships between uncertainty from ecosystem dynamics and climate projections are dependent on geographic location and the targeted ecosystem process. Parameter uncertainty from the LPJmL model does not affect the trajectory of ecosystem response for a given climate change scenario and the primary source of uncertainty for Amazon 'dieback' results from the uncertainty among climate projections. Our approach for describing uncertainty is applicable for informing and prioritizing policy options related to mitigation and adaptation where long-term investments are required."

However, the increasing population and the extraction of natural resources challenge forest governance. This paper assesses the historical evolution of the policy narratives that have driven environmental governance in Brazil. We argue that environmental policy has evolved through an overlapping of narratives, rather than a change in governance logics. The success of REDD+ relies not only on the soundness of its scientific base but also on its interaction with existing narratives, the susceptibility of policies to economic and political changes at the national and international level and the mechanisms of social exclusion it may reinforce."

It points out a set of conjuncture factors that allow us to foresee a new paradigm of sustainable development for the region by transforming the sun's radiant energy into electricity through distributed photovoltaic generation. The new paradigm, as presented in this essay, has the transformative potential to free the region from past regional development dogma, which was dependent on the scarce water resource, and the marginal and predatory use of its Caatinga Biome. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a pre ante design, following the procedures of scenario building, as an adaptation mechanism to climate change in the sector of energy generation and socioeconomic inclusion. Findings - The scenarios of socioeconomic resilience to climate change based on the abundance of solar radiation, rather than the scarcity of water, demonstrates its potential as a global adaptation paradigm to climate change. Research limitations/implications - The developments proposed are dependent on federal legislation changes, allowing the small producer to be remunerated by the energy produced. Practical implications - The proposed smart grid photovoltaic generation program increases the country's resiliency to the effect of droughts and climate change. Social implications - As proposed, the program allows for the reversion of a pattern of long term poverty in semi-arid Northeast Brazil. Originality/value - The exploitation of the characteristics of abundance of the semiarid climate, i.e. its very condition of semi-aridity with abundant solar radiation, is itself an advantage factor toward adaption to unforeseen drought events. Extensive previous research has focused on weighting and monitoring drought i.e. the paradigm of scarcity. The interplay between exploiting Northeast Brazil's abundant factors and climate change adaptation, especially at the small farmer levels constitutes a discovery never before contemplated."

The present study empirically investigates the dynamic impacts of economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, renewable energy use, urbanization, tourism, agricultural value-added, and forested area on CO2 emissions in Brazil. Time series data from 1990 to 2019 were utilized by applying the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach followed by the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) method. The DOLS estimate findings reveal that economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, urbanization, tourism, and agricultural value-added cause environmental degradation by increasing CO2 emissions in Brazil while increasing renewable energy use and forested areas help to mitigate the CO2 emissions in Brazil. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). In addition, the pairwise Granger causality test is utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables. This article put forward policy recommendations toward sustainable development by establishing strong regulatory policy instruments to mitigation of CO2 emissions."

Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection."

Capacity building sits at the very foundation of the climate change regime, together with 'finance' and 'technology development and transfer' mechanisms. Recognizing that developing countries are on the receiving end of implementation projects, this review highlights historical understanding of the constituents of capacity building initiatives and how these can advance humanity towards the global good of decelerating, and even reversing, the adverse impacts of climate change. In particular, the article describes the institutionalization of capacity building since the establishment of the international climate change regime and highlights some of the stances of the Brazilian environmental diplomacy in this process. Furthermore, it emphasizes initiatives taken by developing countries to empower their citizens and to serve as a mainstay for enhancing South-South cooperation by sharing climate-friendly practices and capabilities. With the establishment of the Paris Committee on Capacity Building and Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency at COP21, it is clear that 'clarity' and 'tracking of progress' are the new objective tools needed to build on and supplement NDCs and related national efforts for tackling climate change. Key policy insights Capacity development projects should be tailored to the characteristics and needs of each recipient Non-Annex I country. Effective and lasting development of capabilities requires going beyond imparting technical know-how of environmentally-beneficial technologies and must include adopting a 'learning by doing' approach. National institutions of the recipient countries should be at the helm of capacity building projects to bring in necessary knowledge on national regulations, traditional skills, and resources that are vital to the success of these initiatives. Transparency in information flow and timely multistakeholder assessment of capacity building efforts are the lynchpin for enduring capacity development efforts."

The most-needed substantial upscaling of investments in GHG mitigation options in all sectors, and particularly in manufacturing sectors, can be an opportunity for a green economic development leap in developing countries. Here, we use the Brazilian manufacturing sectors as an example to explore a transformation of its economy while contributing to the Paris targets. Projections of Brazil's economic futures with and without a portfolio of fiscal policies to induce low carbon investments are produced up to 2030 (end year of Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution-NDC), by employing the large-scale macro econometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model, E3ME. Our findings highlight that the correct mix of green stimulus can help modernize and decarbonize the Brazilian manufacturing sectors and allow the country's economy to grow faster (by up to 0.42% compared to baseline) while its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decline (by up to 14.5% in relation to baseline). Investment levels increase, thereby strengthening exports' competitiveness and alleviating external constraints to long-term economic growth in net terms."

We estimate the direct and indirect impact of the projected changes in climate on the yield of the country's main crops. The results point to a broad spatial heterogeneity of impacts across the country. Using the extreme scenarios created by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (RCP 2.6 and 8.5), our predictions indicate that the average annual losses due to climate change range from 0.4% to 1.8% of Brazilian gross domestic product until the end of the century."

In emerging economies experiencing rapid economic growth and social transformations, and large-scale development of urban areas and associated infrastructure, opportunities and challenges exist when considering a broader set of mitigation options. In this paper, we apply the Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDP) approach to develop and report scenarios on the passenger transport sector in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and South Africa. This approach supports an increase in the sectoral ambition of covering all drivers of change in transport mobility and facilitating collective comparison and policy discussions on the barriers and enablers of transitions. The scenario analysis illustrates that all four countries can achieve reductions in emissions per passenger kilometres of 59% and up to 92% by 2050 while meeting growing mobility needs. Lastly, the analysis identifies short-term policy needed to address barriers and promote enablers.Key policy insightsThe scenarios produced in this paper provide targets and guidance, up to 2050, on required ambition in this sector over coming decades.While current national policies are often limited to introducing low-carbon vehicles and fuels, these pathways suggest the important role of a wide spectrum of mitigation options, including systemic measures related to demand-side options.These scenarios suggest that targeted land-use, social, and urban policies could reduce distances between activities, the costs of mobility and time, thereby improving quality of life and supporting the shift to non-motorized and public transport. They highlight a lack of policies to improve the quality of public transport in terms of time and comfort, not only in terms of cost, to avoid a car dependency model with its externalities.Long-term pathways can help support the development of policy-relevant dialogues about barriers and enablers for the transition, thereby supporting the reinforcement of short-term actions and goals."

However, the evidence is limited in low-and middle-income countries, and the productivity losses due to non-optimal temperatures have not been quantified. We aimed to estimate the work-related impacts and economic losses attributable to non-optimal temperatures in Brazil. We col-lected daily mortality data from 510 immediate regions in Brazil during 2000 and 2019. A two-stage time-series analysis was applied to evaluate the association between non-optimum temperatures and the Productivity-Adjusted Life-Years (PALYs) lost. The temperature-PALYs association was fitted for each location in the first stage and then we applied meta -analyses to obtain the national estimations. The attributable fraction (AF) of PALY lost due to ambient temperatures and the corresponding economic costs were calculated for different subgroups of the working-age population. A total of 3,629,661 of PALYs lost were attributed to non-optimal temperatures during 2000-2019 in Brazil, corresponding to 2.90 % (95 % CI: 1.82 %, 3.95 %) of the total PALYs lost. Non-optimal temperatures have led to US$104.86 billion (95 % CI: 65.95, 142.70) of economic costs related to PALYs lost and the economic burden was more substantial in males and the population aged 15-44 years. Higher risks of extreme cold temperatures were observed in the South region in Brazil while extreme hot temperatures were observed in the Central West and Northeast regions. In conclusion, non -optimal temperatures are associated with considerable labour losses as well as economic costs in Brazil. Tailored policies and adaptation strategies should be proposed to mitigate the impacts of non-optimal temperatures on the labour supply in a changing climate."

Most of the plants are concentrated in the southeast region, where the largest consumers and the largest population concentration are located. The expansion of this system, considering the hydroelectric contributions, will occur exploring the potentials located in the Amazon region. This analysis paper shows that the variations imposed by climate changes on some climatological variables create significant uncertainties about the power generation forecasts of the hydroelectric power plants to be installed in the Amazon, thus compromising the financial economic feasibility of these enterprises and also possibly compromising the expansion plans of the Brazilian energy system. The methodological approach uses information from various climate change scenarios and compares those with historical hydrological patterns and generation information. By exploring the characteristics of a large-scale hydrothermal system with high dependence on water resources, this paper provides valuable insights on how energy policy would address hydroelectric vulnerabilities and climate change. This analysis is focused on the Brazilian case but reveals important issues related to systems with hydro thermal characteristics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Thus, the analyses proposed by this study aimed at identifying the impact of climate change on naturalised streamflows and Affluent Natural Energy (NEA) projections for the Bravilian electricity sector using six models of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project, based on the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the 21st century. The streamflows for the 24 stations representing the National Interconnected System (NIS) were estimated through the concentrated hydrological model SMAP (Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure), while the streamflows for the other stations that comprise the NIS were obtained by linear regression. The streamflows, as well as the productivity of the reservoirs, were used to calculate the NEA. The results showed that most of the models project possible reductions in annual naturalized streamflows and NEA for the three periods analyzed and for the North, Northeast and Southeast/Midwest sectors. Meanwhile, in the Southern sector, for the period 2010-2039, most of the models indicated an increase in the annual naturalized streamflows and NEA."

Drawing on past applications of the disaster risk reduction framework, we identify four critical factors that have led to reductions in risk: flexible, learning-based, responsive governance; committed, reform-minded and politically active actors; disaster risk reduction integrated into other social and economic policy processes; and a long-term commitment to managing risk. We find that while the presence of these factors has reduced overall risk in both regions, in Ceara, disaster response as it is currently practiced, has fallen short of addressing the fundamental causes of vulnerability that leave those prone to hazards able to cope in the short term, yet enmeshed in poverty and at risk from the longer-term changes associated with climate change. Although calls for integration of disaster risk management with poverty eradication are not new, there has been insufficient attention paid in the literature on how to foster such integration. Based on the two case studies, we argue that the adoption of good governance mechanisms (such as stakeholder participation, access to knowledge, accountability and transparency) in disaster risk reduction policy may create the policy environment that is conducive to the kind of structural reform needed to build long-term adaptive capacity to climate-driven impacts, We conclude that without a synergistic two-tiered approach that includes both disaster risk reduction and structural reform, disaster risk reduction, in the face of climate changes, will prove to be an expensive and ineffective palliative treatment of changing risks.

The potential is rapidly growing for carbon markets to deliver private and public compensation for emissions reductions from forest protection at national and subnational scales. Nevertheless, monetization of forest ecosystem services remains scant, leaving forests vulnerable to conversion to other land uses in the short run. We develop a real options framework for a representative farmer's land-use decisions, identifying a value gap between private short-term incentives versus long-term benefits from carbon market compensation, given uncertainties over future values for emissions reductions from forest protection. A quantitative illustration of this framework for Mato Grosso, Brazil, demonstrates that forest conservation coupled with cattle ranching intensification is competitive with the predominant practice of extensive cattle production, but is hindered by landholders' perceptions of the relative option values to different land uses. We show how bonds, call and put options allow for early monetization of part of potential future carbon revenues, even under uncertainty, changing incentives at the landholder level and jumpstarting conservation and more efficient models of agricultural production. These approaches provide a model for addressing the financial needs of farmers on the ground to accelerate the transition towards low-deforestation rural development at large scales."

When it comes to the legitimacy of norms to address the complexities of social conditions of vulnerability and effective actions to fulfil distributive and climate justice principles, climate change still faces a discrepancy between political announcements and incongruous practices of international actors. While analysing the cases of China and the European Union, we point out contradictions stemming from their policy goals guided by strategic interests. From a global climate justice perspective, we analyze recent power dynamics that operate at two levels: first, economic relations and negotiations between Brazil and the two poles of power, considering the scenario of socio-environmental injustice and climate insecurity; second, policy practices of both global players in climate governance, bearing in mind the notions of climate justice and development as conceptual guides to understand when and where contradictions emerge. To do so, this article is structured around three sections: (i) a brief historical account of China's and the EU's roles in international climate policy; (ii) their legacies in climate governance and the inextricable relationship between their normative behaviour and their development objectives; (iii) an overview of the signing of the strategic memorandum of understanding for economic and trade agreement between Mercosur and the EU in 2019, as well as Sino-Brazilian relations facilitating investments and trade in multiple segments vis-a-vis the most recent multifaceted backlash in Brazil's socio-environmental and climate policies."

However, there is a limited assessment of the health economic losses attributable to wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Methods: We collected daily time-series data on all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality from 510 immediate regions in Brazil during 2000-2016. The chemical transport model GEOS-Chem driven with Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED), in combination with ground monitored data and machine learning was used to estimate wildfire-related PM2.5 data at a resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. A time-series design was applied in each immediate region to assess the association between economic losses due to mortality and wildfire-related PM2.5 and the estimates were pooled at the national level using a random-effect meta-analysis. We used a metaregression model to explore the modification effect of GDP and its sectors (agriculture, industry, and service) on economic losses.Results: During 2000-2016, a total of US$81.08 billion economic losses (US$5.07 billion per year) due to mortality were attributable to wildfire-related PM2.5 in Brazil, accounting for 0.68% of economic losses and equivalent to approximately 0.14% of Brazil's GDP. The attributable fraction (AF) of economic losses due to wildfire-related PM2.5 was positively associated with the proportion of GDP from agriculture, while negatively associated with the proportion of GDP from service.Conclusion: Substantial economic losses due to mortality were associated with wildfires, which could be influenced by the agriculture and services share of GDP per capita. Our estimates of the economic losses of mortality could be used to determine optimal levels of investment and resources to mitigate the adverse health impacts of wildfires."

Its energy mix makes Brazil one of the least energy-related carbon-intensive economies worldwide. Given that the country is fast becoming one of the world's economic powerhouses, decision-makers need to understand the drivers underlying past and current carbon dioxide emissions trends. We therefore investigate a) which key long-term drivers have led to Brazil's unique emissions profile, and b) the implications of these drivers for Brazil's national policies. We show that Brazil's emissions are growing mainly due to increasing individual standards of living, exports and population size, and that this growth is so far unchallenged by technological and structural improvements toward lower emissions intensities and more efficient production structures. As these trends are likely to continue amidst growing international pressure on key economies to reduce their carbon emissions, a decoupling of drivers from emissions is needed to simultaneously meet development and environmental goals."

This article investigates how marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves can inform such a decision. We re-analyse a MAC curve built for Brazil by 2030, and show that misinterpreting MAC curves as abatement supply curves can lead to suboptimal strategies. It would lead to (1) under-investment in expensive, long-to-implement and large-potential options, such as clean transportation infrastructure, and (2) over-investment in cheap but limited-potential options such as energy-efficiency improvement in refineries. To mitigate this issue, the article proposes a new graphical representation of MAC curves that explicitly renders the time required to implement each measure.Policy relevanceIn addition to the cost and potential of available options, designing optimal short-term policies requires information on long-term targets (e.g. halving emissions by 2050) and on the speed at which measures can deliver emission reductions. Mitigation policies are thus best investigated in a dynamic framework, building on sector-scale pathways to long-term targets. Climate policies should seek both quantity and quality of abatement, by combining two approaches: a synergy approach' that focuses on the cheapest mitigation options and maximizes co-benefits, and an urgency approach' that starts from a long-term objective and works backward to identify actions that need to be implemented early. Accordingly, sector-specific policies may be used (1) to remove implementation barriers on negative- and low-cost options and (2) to ensure short-term targets are met with abatement of sufficient quality. Indeed, such policies can avoid under-investment in the long-to-implement options required to reach long-term targets, which are otherwise difficult to enforce."

The exceptional 2020 fire season in Pantanal drew particular attention due to the severe wildfires and the catastrophic natural and socio-economic impacts witnessed within the biome. So far, little progress has been made in order to better understand the influence of climate extremes on fire occurrence in Pantanal. Here, we evaluate how extreme hot conditions, through heatwave events, are related to the occurrence and the exacerbation of fires in this region. A historical analysis using a statistical regression model found that heatwaves during the dry season explained 82% of the interannual variability of burned area during the fire season. In a future perspective, an ensemble of CORDEX-CORE simulations assuming different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), reveal a significant increasing trend in heatwave occurrence over Pantanal. Compared to historical levels, the RCP2.6 scenario leads to more than a doubling in the Pantanal heatwave incidence during the dry season by the second half of the 21st century, followed by a plateauing. Alternatively, RCP8.5 projects a steady increase of heatwave incidence until the end of the century, pointing to a very severe scenario in which heatwave conditions would be observed nearly over all the Pantanal area and during practically all the days of the dry season. Accordingly, favorable conditions for fire spread and consequent large burned areas are expected to occur more often in the future, posing a dramatic short-term threat to the ecosystem if no preservation action is undertaken."

This study compares Brazil's least-cost strategies to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 with strategies based on the technological development patterns suggested by the most recent International Energy Agency's (IEA) net zero report, which are assumed to represent global trends in technology deployment for climate mitigation. Our study is based on the use of an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) for Brazil. Four different mitigation scenarios are explored. Results show that the IEA technological profile deeply differs from a non-constrained technological deployment for Brazil, particularly in terms of the liquid fuels mix and the time of implementation of electric-driven mobility. In Brazil, biofuels use stand out as the least-cost solution to reach net zero emissions by 2050, mostly due to the use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which can slow down fossil fuel phase out in the country. Nevertheless, a hybrid strategy can include the use of ethanol or even hydrogen fuel cells in electric powertrains, though this would require further research and development."
> 10.1088/1748-9326/abb62c,Estimating the multi-decadal carbon deficit of burned Amazonian forests,"Wildfires in humid tropical forests have become more common in recent years, increasing the rates of tree mortality in forests that have not co-evolved with fire. Estimating carbon emissions from these wildfires is complex. Current approaches rely on estimates of committed emissions based on static emission factors through time and space, yet these emissions cannot be assigned to specific years, and thus are not comparable with other temporally-explicit emission sources. Moreover, committed emissions are gross estimates, whereas the long-term consequences of wildfires require an understanding of net emissions that accounts for post-fire uptake of CO2. Here, using a 30 year wildfire chronosequence from across the Brazilian Amazon, we calculate net CO2 emissions from Amazon wildfires by developing statistical models comparing post-fire changes in stem mortality, necromass decomposition and vegetation growth with unburned forest plots sampled at the same time. Over the 30 yr time period, gross emissions from combustion during the fire and subsequent tree mortality and decomposition were equivalent to 126.1 Mg CO2 ha(-1) of which 73% (92.4 Mg CO2 ha(-1)) resulted from mortality and decomposition. These emissions were only partially offset by forest growth, with an estimated CO2 uptake of 45.0 Mg ha(-1)over the same time period. Our analysis allowed us to assign emissions and growth across years, revealing that net annual emissions peak 4 yr after forest fires. At present, Brazil's National Determined Contribution (NDC) for emissions fails to consider forest fires as a significant source, even though these are likely to make a substantial and long-term impact on the net carbon balance of Amazonia. Considering long-term post-fire necromass decomposition and vegetation regrowth is crucial for improving global carbon budget estimates and national greenhouse gases (GHG) inventories for tropical forest countries."

Since 1990, land-use change has been the most important source of GHG emissions in the country. The voluntary goals to limit Brazilian GHG emissions pledged a reduction in between 36.1% and 38.9% of GHG emissions projected to 2020, to be 610% lower than in 2005. Brazil is in a good position to meet the voluntary mitigation goals pledged to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) up to 2020: recent efforts to reduce deforestation have been successful and avoided deforestation will form the bulk of the emissions reduction commitment. In 2020, if governmental mitigation goals are met, then GHG emissions from the energy system would become the largest in the country. After 2020, if no additional mitigation actions are implemented, GHG emissions will increase again in the period 20202030, due to population and economic growth driving energy demand, supply and GHG emissions. However, Brazil is in a strong position to take a lead in low-carbon economic and social development due to its huge endowment of renewable energy resources allowing for additional mitigation actions to be adopted after 2020. Policy relevance The period beyond 2020 is now relevant in climate policy due to the Durban Platform agreeing a protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force' that will have effect from 2020. After 2020, Brazil will be in a situation more similar to other industrialized countries, faced with a new challenge of economic development with low GHG energy-related emissions, requiring the adoption of mitigation policies and measures targeted at the energy system. Unlike the mitigation actions in the land-use change sector, where most of the funding will come from the national budgets due to sovereignty concerns, the huge financial resources needed to develop low-carbon transport and energy infrastructure could benefit from soft loans channelled to the country through nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs)."

This paper summarizes an analysis of the social and economic implications of long-term greenhouse gas emissions scenarios in Brazil. Recent studies analyzing low-carbon scenarios for Brazil are reviewed, including the IES-Brasil (Economic and Social Implications of Mitigation Scenarios in Brazil) scenarios up to 2030 and 2050, the latter including an emissions pathway consistent with a 1.5 degrees C target for limiting global temperature increase. The findings of these studies highlight that, if appropriate policy tools (both command-and-control measures and microeconomic policies) are used to overcome the barriers to mitigation options, a decoupling of economic growth and GHG emissions would be possible without harming economic and social development in Brazil."

In recent years, the Brazilian presidential elections in 2018 and the recovery from one of the nation's worst economic recessions defined a political scenario that has been causing shifts in the patterns of land cover change. A variety of national plans for the near-future exist and include the construction of new roads connecting remote Amazonian areas and large dams that could flood up to 10 million hectares. These development plans threaten environmental conservation, but the potential effects on the local or regional land cover are mostly unknown. In this work, we construct a model to evaluate the possible consequences of policy actions on land cover dynamics in the near-future at a high-resolution scale. The regression model extracts the historical relationships between land cover and spatial drivers of change, and its extrapolation for the future enables the simulation of scenarios for the national plans currently discussed in Brazil. We also simulate three scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which makes contrasting management assumptions. The resulting maps indicate that considerable changes in land cover composition and configuration may occur even in a short period. The historical Brazilian economic forces make the decrease in natural vegetation probabilities challenging to stop even in an environmentally oriented scenario, where plans for the construction of new infrastructure are abruptly interrupted. Our results also indicate that environmental degradation cannot be prevented without coordinated efforts between public agencies with a broad diversity of development viewpoints.

The rapid and cluttered development of mining in the Brazilian Amazonia is historically related to local economic collapse, besides representing a global environmental risk. Here we bring a historical perspective of human activities in the Brazilian Amazonia, focusing on mining activities to discuss how it can threaten Amazonia's integrity, leading to negative consequences to biodiversity, human populations, and the world climate system. We also highlight the role of indigenous lands on buffering the impacts of human-induced environmental threats, which depends on government actions toward sustainable policies rather than inadequate environmental regulation aiming short term profits.

The public availability of systematic and long-term information of the ocean is an engine for the Blue Economy, boosting economic growth, employment, and innovation. An overview of some Brazilian initiatives is presented in this paper, involving universities, private companies, federal and state agencies, covering institutions from south to north of Brazil. Although these initiatives focus mainly on ocean physics, integrated efforts can extend the scope to include biogeochemistry and marine biodiversity, helping to address interdisciplinary problems. Existing initiatives can be connected, and new ones fostered, to fill in the gaps of temporal and spatial coverage of ocean monitoring in the vast oceanic area under Brazilian jurisdiction (nationally referred to as the Blue Amazon, in reference to the similar richness of the Amazon Forest). The alignment among national and regional initiatives, as well as with international programs, can be promoted if coordinated by a national-level organization, maximizing the return of public investment and socioeconomic benefits. In light of international examples, possible future institutional arrangements are discussed, leveraging from existing national public policies and international cooperation that Brazil is taking part. The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development is a timely opportunity to encourage an institutional arrangement to support and articulate an integrated network of coastal observatories in Brazil."

This then allows for the informed weighing of different policy options. Taking a social network perspective, we argue that the role of social influence as a driver of policy learning has been overlooked in the literature. Network research has shown that normatively laden belief change is likely to occur through complex contagion-a process in which an actor receives social reinforcement from more than one contact in its social network. We test the applicability of this idea to policy learning using node-level network regression models on a unique longitudinal policy network survey dataset concerning the Reducing Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiative in Brazil, Indonesia, and Vietnam. We find that network connections explain policy learning in Indonesia and Vietnam, where the policy subsystems are collaborative, but not in Brazil, where the level of conflict is higher and the subsystem is more established. The results suggest that policy learning is more likely to result from social influence and complex contagion in collaborative than in conflictual settings."

However, despite progress, deforestation remains above the target, and forest wildfires in old-growth Amazonian forests surged by 152% in 2023 versus 2022, threatening biodiversity and carbon stocks. The rise in fires poses challenges for traditional farmers, impacts urban areas' air quality, and necessitates urgent measures like enhanced firefighting capabilities and long-term strategies for fire-free production chains to protect the Amazonian standing forests-a global socio-environmental asset."

The apparent consumption of this type of paper from 1961 to 2016, calculated from the data of the FAOSTAT system, was used to estimate the amount of waste disposed of annually in three site categories: sanitary landfill, controlled dump, and open-air, uncontrolled dump. The 2006 IPCC Guide methodology was used to calculate CH4 emissions and long-term carbon storage. Nine scenarios based upon the law that establishes the National Solid Waste Policy (NSWP) were examined, considering 100% waste disposal and treatment in landfills or incineration from 2014. The total emission was estimated at 1.967 MtCH4, corresponding to 55.080 MtCO2eq by GWP-AR5, and the stored carbon at 3.724 Mt, corresponding to 13.655 MtCO2eq. CH4emission increased beyond the population growth rate due to an increase in the per capita paper consumption in the country, from 0.02 kgCH4.year-1 in 1961 to 0.30 kg CH4.year-1 in 2016. The NSWP has not yet been accomplished, and the scenarios outlined indicate that, from the point of view of CH4 emissions, it would be more advantageous to carry out incineration instead of applying other waste treatment technologies."

Modelling tools are needed to help understand the range of possible outcomes due to these ?telecoupled? global-to-local relationships, given future political, economic and environmental uncertainties. Here, we present CRAFTY-Brazil, a LUCC model representing production of multiple agricultural commodities that accounts for spatially explicit (e.g., land access) and temporally contingent (e.g., agricultural debt) processes of importance across our nearly four million km2 Brazilian study area. We calibrate the model calibration for 2001?2018, and run tests and scenarios about commodity demand, agricultural yields, climate change, and policy decisions for 2019?2035. Results indicate greater confidence in modelled time-series than spatial allocation. We discuss how our approach might be best understood to be agency-based, rather than agent-based, and highlight questions more and less appropriate for this approach."

However, the impact of air pollution on labour productivity at the population level is still unknown. This study assessed the association between premature death due to PM2.5 exposure and the loss of productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs), in Brazil. We applied a novel variant of the difference-in-difference (DID) approach to assess the association. Daily all-cause mortality data in Brazil were collected from 2000-2019. The PALYs lost increased by 5.11% (95% CI: 4.10-6.13%), for every 10 mu g/m3 increase in the 2-day moving average of PM2.5. A total of 9,219,995 (95% CI: 7,491,634-10,921,141) PALYs lost and US$ 268.05 (95% CI: 217.82-317.50) billion economic costs were attributed to PM2.5 exposure, corresponding to 7.37% (95% CI: 5.99-8.73%) of the total PALYs lost due to premature death. This study also found that 5,005,306 PALYs could be avoided if the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guideline (AQG) level was met. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ambient PM2.5 exposure is associated with a considerable labour productivity burden relating to premature death in Brazil, while over half of the burden could be prevented if the WHO AQG was met. The findings highlight the need to reduce ambient PM2.5 levels and provide strong evidence for the development of strategies to mitigate the economic impacts of air pollution."

In this regard, this article advances research on green bond markets in emerging economies (EEs) by comparing the evolution of the certified green bonds markets in Brazil and China. For this purpose, a mixed analysis was applied. The qualitative analysis is based on a literature review to contextualise the main drivers and barriers to the evolution of the green bond market in light of national policies and features of the financial system in each country. For the quantitative analysis, the certified green bond markets are assessed in terms of the amounts issued as a percentage of the debt securities markets, considering the participation of each issuer type and the allocation of revenue across eligible sectors. Information on certified green bond amounts issued and on debt securities' markets was obtained from the Climate Bonds Initiative and BIS databases. The results show that the evolution of the Chinese and Brazilian certified green bonds markets remains negligible, in terms of the whole debt securities market. Although green bonds may be considered an important market solution, they still do not provide sufficient resources necessary for a meaningful green transition, especially in EEs. However, findings also show that in China, compared to Brazil, features of the financial system combine with more consolidated green policies to act in favour of scaling up and distributing revenue to crucial sectors to green transition. Key policy insights Without well-coordinated national green policies and appropriated institutional arrangements, the growth of the debt securities market in emerging economies (EEs) will not boost the certified green bond market. In EEs, notably in Brazil and China, the central government's influence on the policy coordination and the financial system is fundamental in achieving green goals. Greater participation of state-owned financial institutions in EEs could improve the access to finance more emergent solutions (e.g. low carbon transport, water infrastructure, etc.) beyond more mature ones (the usual solar and wind energy) to promote the green transition."

Past dynamics and future drivers affecting demand for sugar, ethanol, biogas and bioelectricity from Brazil's sugarcane sector","Brazil's sugarcane sector is a significant source of employment, and operates at the intersection of energy, agriculture and land use. Its future development will be affected by the values, decisions and actions of key actors. Accordingly, we report on the results of qualitative semi-structured interviews with 19 participants with expertise in relation to Brazil's sugarcane sector. We used visual aids, and reflections on past events, to structure and contextualise discussions about the future prospects for the sector as a whole, and for four of its potential products - sugar, ethanol, electricity and biogas. Interviews revealed general expectations of continued growth in the sector, particularly for its energy-related products. However, the possibility of future challenges and tensions is still evident. We suggest three inter-related areas for ongoing reflection. First, there may be value in balancing the desire for minimal intervention, technology neutral styles of policy, with the need for policy that is clear, long-term and impactful. In some cases, more targeted policies for particular actors or emergent technologies, may also be justified. Second, increased clarity on the broader objectives for the sector, including the relative prioritisation of economic, social and environmental objectives, may help industry to make the long term investments consistent with the kind of deep innovation for which there is potential. Third, it is worth reflecting on how the above issues in combination can be leveraged into a global leadership strategy, with consideration of the relative robustness of different leadership strategies within broader emerging global dynamics."

However, the success of interregional cooperation depends on whether a satisfying agreement can be reached. Regional bargaining powers may heavily influence the outcome of such an agreement. This paper uses cooperative game theory to assess bargaining powers in the cooperative deployment of CDR between the United States (US), the European Union (EU), Brazil, and China. We compute least-costly CDR pathways under multiple cooperative configurations using the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technologies (MONET) framework, assuming regional CDR targets that are proportional to greenhouse gas emissions. Then, we apply cooperative game theory to derive relative bargaining powers from the cost evaluations in MONET. We find that cooperation can lead to substantial CDR cost reductions, ranging from 11% to 43%. Furthermore, we identify two distinct types of regions that possess considerable bargaining power: (1) regions with minimal historical responsibility towards climate change but abundant resources for CDR implementation (exemplified by Brazil in this study); and (2) regions with limited domestic resources amidst large CDR targets (represented by either the USA or China, here). These findings illustrate the potential leverage certain regions in the Global South could wield in the collaborative deployment of CDR under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement."
> 10.1029/2019GL083003,Attribution of Detected Temperature Trends in Southeast Brazil,"Southeast Brazil has great economic importance for Brazil and is highly vulnerable to extreme events like floods and droughts. Studies have shown an increase of temperature in this region. Using a new detection and attribution framework (Ribes et al., 2017, ) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models, this change is found to be largely due to greenhouse gases. We estimate that greenhouse gases contribute a warming of 0.95 to 1.5 degrees C to the observed warming trend of 1.1 degrees C between 1955 and 2004. Temperature changes from natural and nongreenhouse gas anthropogenic forcing are estimated to be small over this period. Results are robust using different time windows. Using the Community Earth System Model ensembles to evaluate the impacts of internal variability, observational and model error shows that most uncertainty arises from model error. Plain Language Summary Southeast Brazil has great economic importance for Brazil and is highly vulnerable to extreme events like floods, droughts, and heat waves. Many studies link those kind of events with an increase in temperature due to climate change, largely caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. This study tested whether or not human-induced climate change is responsible for the observed increase in temperature in Southeast Brazil. The observed 1.1 degrees C per 50-year trend is largely due to increasing greenhouse gases, which means that they have a significant role in observed changes in Southeast Brazilian temperatures."

We adapt a partial equilibrium model in the agricultural composite good and lands markets to guide the specification and estimation of a simultaneous equation model (SEM) for agricultural demand, land yield and acreage, and calculate market equilibrium responsiveness. We estimate the SEM by the generalised method of moments three-stage least squares (GMM 3SLS) using a panel data set of the 10 biggest agricultural producer states in Brazil from 2001 to 2017. Using demand, land yield and acreage price elasticity estimates, we find that Brazil may expand equilibrium agricultural output while preserving its native vegetation land and dampening long-term agricultural price escalation under a scenario of increasing worldwide demand for food, fibre and fuel and adverse climate shocks. Using acreage and land yield freight rate elasticity estimates, we show how shocks may be offset by road infrastructure policies that reduce freight rates to specific destination states, as they may be designed to induce less equilibrium land use for the same equilibrium output or raise equilibrium output with less equilibrium land use."
> 10.1007/s11356-021-16758-2,Does renewable energy use enhance exchange rate appreciation and stable rate of inflation?,"The current study is aimed at investigating the relationship between the use of renewable energy, the rate of currency exchange, and the rate of inflation with the ARDL model. The findings of the ECM show that in the long run, a bidirectional association between exchange rate and renewable energy exists in Brazil. This shows that the rate of currency exchange affects the use of renewable energy, and the use of renewable energy affects the rate of currency exchange. The inflation rate also affects renewable energy and exchange rate in the long run. The rate of adjustment to equilibrium is also below 50%, indicating that it will take a long time to adjust to long-run equilibrium. In the short run, we ascertain that renewable energy use has a significant negative effect on the rate of currency exchange, showing that a rise in the use of renewable energy significantly causes the exchange rate to appreciate. The long-run results show that renewable energy use negatively impacts exchange rate (appreciation), while the inflation rate and rate of currency exchange significantly affect the use of renewable energy positively. Thus, in addition to lowering carbon dioxide emissions and global warming effects, renewable energy use also facilitates an improvement in the currency's value. Therefore, the use of renewable energy should be promoted, and nations should shift to the use of renewable energy. This will also promote zero carbon in the future."

Four months after the first report, the oil has already been found along >3000 km of the Brazilian coastline on >980 beaches and was recently observed along the Amazon coast, making this oil spill the most extensive and severe environmental disaster ever recorded in Brazilian history, in the South Atlantic basin, and in tropical coastal regions worldwide. Four features of this oil-spill disaster make it unique: 1) the characteristics of the oil spill; 2) the characteristics of the affected region in tropical Brazil; 3) the significant number of protected areas (>55) and tropical ecosystems affected by the oil; and 4) the absence of measures and/or flaws in the measures taken by the federal government to address this environmental and social emergency. The affected species and poor human communities in Brazil should receive focused attention in the coming decades owing to the long-term impacts of the oil contamination. Environmental monitoring and response measures must be implemented to minimize the ecological, economic, and social effects of the spill. Biodiversity and climate regulation losses considering blue carbon environments should drive discussions regarding mining accidents and global consequences related to pre-salt oil exploitation, new spill events, and their global impacts. These measures are particularly relevant in areas with high tropical biodiversity and high social inequality, as in the present case, which represents one of the worst-case scenarios of an environmental and governmental disaster."
> 10.1016/j.rser.2022.112860,When being renewable may not be enough: Typologies of trends in energy and carbon footprint towards sustainable development,"Renewable energy has been encouraged to address climate change and promote sustainable development, leading to structural changes in the national energy matrices. Brazil is reaching a 50/50 renewable/non-renewable energy mix. However, the wide variability in emissions intensity among renewable sources raises questions about the effectiveness of structural changes for SDGs. The present study aims to identify typological profiles (TPs) of structural changes in sectoral energy and carbon footprint and their contributions to sustainable development. From an ecological input-output model, we calculated the sectoral energy and carbon footprint for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The method adds novelty by creating typologies of structural changes confronting renewable vs. non-renewable and mainly renewable vs. renewable. Four TPs of structural change were found. TP-I and TP-II tended to increase the relative share of renewables in their energy footprint, opposing TP-III and TP-IV. A controversy emerged contrasting TP-I and TP-II since both increased renewable consumption. TP-I decreased the renewable emissions while TP-II increased them. The explanation lies in the energy sources' emissions intensity. While TP-I sectors tended to increase the consumption of renewable energies with low in-tensity of emissions, such as electricity, TP-II sectors increased the consumption of renewables whose gross emissions intensity could be even higher than non-renewables. Therefore, the simple substitution of non-renewable for renewable sources may not be enough. Pursuing the long-term sustainable structural changes need to be planned based on renewable sources with the lowest net emission intensity and highest renewability."

Results show that, in the year 2000 alone, some 11% in CO2 emissions from energy use in Brazil have been reduced compared to what would have been emitted that year had the actions reviewed here not been implemented in good time. As these actions have not been motivated as a strategy to curb global climate change, if their benefits related to avoided carbon emissions are not fully appraised in the near future, chances are that these policies may be discontinued. For instance, in the case of the business-as-usual scenario drawn up by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in 2001, the discontinuity of the policies analyzed here would result in CO2 emissions 20% higher by 2020, compared to what would happen were these policies kept over the long term. Therefore, the perspective presented here spotlights some of the hidden benefits of the programs and measures underway in the country, justifying their continuation or even intensification.

However, sea-level rise can affect mangroves' protective role by increasing expo-sure to coastal hazards and economic costs. To better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sea-level rise, we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosion/accretion rates on the shoreline. We assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves. Finally, we estimated the economic losses and costs from the long-term retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss. This study was carried out along the western coast of the South Atlantic, in the northeast Brazilian region. Coastal exposure indices were estimated using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software, and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. Finally, the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building. The results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030. In terms of the value of property loss, this translates to US$38,800 and would in-crease to US$72,000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario. Based on our coastal vulnerability assessment, almost 50 km of the coastline (20%) would transition to intermediate-high exposure levels if the current dis-tribution of mangroves were to be lost. It is expected to cost about US$145 million in rockfill works and US$21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sea-level rise on mangroves ecosystem services. At the national level, a total loss of mangroves in Brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly US$4000 million. More robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystem-service co-benefits they provide. The latter is essential in low-and middle -income nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and well-being."
> 10.1371/journal.pone.0152311,Brazil's Market for Trading Forest Certificates,"Brazil faces an enormous challenge to implement its revised Forest Code. Despite big losses for the environment, the law introduces new mechanisms to facilitate compliance and foster payment for ecosystem services (PES). The most promising of these is a market for trading forest certificates (CRAs) that allows landowners to offset their restoration obligations by paying for maintaining native vegetation elsewhere. We analyzed the economic potential for the emerging CRA market in Brazil and its implications for PES programs. Results indicate a potential market for trading 4.2 Mha of CRAs with a gross value of US$9.2 +/- 2.4 billion, with main regional markets forming in the states of Mato Grosso and Sao Paulo. This would be the largest market for trading forests in the world. Overall, the potential supply of CRAs in Brazilian states exceeds demand, creating an opportunity for additional PES programs to use the CRA market. This expanded market could provide not only monetary incentives to conserve native vegetation, but also environmental co-benefits by fostering PES programs focused on biodiversity, water conservation, and climate regulation. Effective implementation of the Forest Code will be vital to the success of this market and this hurdle brings uncertainty into the market. Long-term commitment, both within Brazil and abroad, will be essential to overcome the many challenges ahead."

However, will REDD+ outcomes persist over time after interventions have ended? Using quasi-experimental methods, we investigated the effects of one REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation and people's well-being, including intra-community spillover effects (leakage). We then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended (permanence). This project combined Payments for Environmental Services (PES) with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation. Data came from face-to-face surveys with 113 households (treatment: 52; non-participant from treatment communities: 35; control: 46) in a three-datapoint panel design (2010, 2014 and 2019). Results indicate the REDD+ project conserved an average of 7.8% to 10.3% of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees' well-being by 27-44%. We found no evidence for significant intra-community leakage. After the project ended, forest loss rebounded and perceived well-being declined - yet, importantly, past saved forest was not cleared. Therefore, our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activity-reducing ('set-aside'): forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated."

Therefore, this paper aims to examine the socio-economic and cultural factors that shape the sustainability of water management strategies in Brazil and Portugal. This study highlights various factors that influence water management, including robust legal frameworks, socio-economic disparities, cultural practices, agricultural water usage, knowledge sharing, public participation, climate change resilience, water scarcity risks, industrial water consumption, and urbanization. By conducting a SWOT analysis of water management strategies, this research synthesizes information through an extensive literature review, encompassing the legal frameworks, policies, and implemented strategies in both countries. Additionally, it investigates comparative studies among Brazil, Portugal, and other European nations to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences in water management practices. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with water management strategies in Brazil and Portugal, thereby guiding the development of tailored policies and strategies that foster sustainability in water resource management. Additionally, the research highlights the role of digital transformation in optimizing water management practices.

The period of economic and social recovery following the pandemic presents an unprecedented opportunity to invest in biorefineries based on the pyrolysis of agricultural residues. These produce a plethora of sustainable resources while also contributing to the economic valorization of first-sector local economies. However, biomass-derived pyrolysis liquid is highly oxygenated, which hinders its long-term stability and usability. Catalytic hydrogenation is a proposed upgrading method to reduce this hindrance, while recent studies on the use of nickel and niobium as low-cost catalysts, both abundant in Brazil, reinforce the potential synergy between different economic sectors within the country. This review gathers state-of-the-art applications of these technologies with the intent to guide the scientific community and lawmakers alike on yet another alternative for energy and commodities production within an environmentally sustainable paradigm."

Brazil is a world leader in the use of conventional renewable energy sources, such as hydro power, while Germany has been achieving outstanding results in fostering NCRES. The focus is on two critical issues: the legal and regulatory framework and the institutions created to support the NCRES market development The comparison shows that, despite the very different energy situations and policy drivers, valuables lessons can be extracted from the German experience. The main lesson for Brazil is to think NCRES as a strategic opportunity to rely less on fossil fuel and large hydroelectric power plants, to decentralize the electric power sector, to use the huge solar, biomass and wind power potential available in the country and to create a environment-friendly NCRES industry. To this end, three critical points were identified: (1) the legal and regulatory framework should be improved; (2) long-term energy planning taking into account social, economic and climate issues and; (3) the current institutions supporting NCRES in Brazil should be upgraded and/or new ones, such as more specific energy agencies, should be created.

With the reduction of solar PV module prices around the world and the high tariffs for residential consumers in Brazil some regions of the country with large solar radiation resource are reaching the grid electricity-price parity. In this context the objective of this paper is to evaluate scenarios of technology diffusion up to 2030 considering policy mechanisms to foster the development of grid connected PV generation. The three mechanisms assessed are the net metering compensation scheme as proposed by the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL), feed-in tariffs and direct subsidies to PV installations. We evaluate the market penetration potential in each case using a logit-function approach. The investigation results show that PV distributed technology has good opportunities for Brazil to diversify its energy matrix with potential economic and environmental benefits. However it is clear that the absence of long-term energy policy objectives for solar PV and the Jack of additional support mechanisms could reflect in an inefficient and incipient adoption of this technology and the loss of its potential benefits.

Understanding these linkages is necessary to formulate effective policies that can influence positive outcomes and contribute to the realization of long-term economic, environmental, and social goals. The use of biofuels can help achieve the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implement the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, the biofuels sector must account for its interdependencies and trade-offs with other sectors. In this study, we formulate a qualitative analytical model that goes beyond the three water-energy-food nexus components by incorporating other elements, such as policy, innovation, governance, and labor to examine their effect as influencing factors and to understand how synergies, trade-offs, and long-overlooked interlinkages between sectors and among existing policies and institutions can become visible. This qualitative model was applied to the case of ethanol in Brazil, for which a large corpus was constructed from the scientific literature, documents and sustainability reports from sugarcane ethanol companies. We used a supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) algorithm along with co-occurrence and network analyses. The results demonstrate this approach can be used to evaluate the interfaces between science, policy, and businesses within the WEFL-biofuels nexus. This is done by identifying how best to integrate the development of policies, governance, and stakeholder actions to support cost-effective decisions for optimal resource management and regulatory processes while enabling better integration of scientific insight and policy-making. We also identified how these four influencing factors are of vital importance within the nexus and, if properly addressed, can contribute to more holistic nexus thinking management."

The widespread use of these devices is the mainly responsible for the high peak on the electricity demand of the residential sector, observed between 18: 00 and 21: 00 hours. As a consequence of that, costs and service quality are undermined, affecting consumers and the electricity sector in general. In attempt to deal with this issue, solar hot water systems have been proposed as an option to reduce the electricity consumption of the showerheads. However, despite of the high incidence of solar radiation on the Brazilian territory indicates a significant economy, currently there is no technical assessment quantifying the economic benefits on the region. The present study estimates the economic impacts resulting by the deployment of solar hot water systems in Brazilian households. Hence, the feasibility study allows assessing the potential of solar water heating as alternative to reduce the peak on the electricity demand in Brazil. In order to perform the proposed analysis, long-term performance simulations were performed on an hourly basis using the TRNSYS software as computational tool and typical meteorological year (TMY) files as input data. The TRNSYS component (Type 45) relating the solar water heating equipment had been experimentally validated, whereas the weather data was obtained from the SWERA database. Also, a time dependent profile of the heating demand is considered, according the measurements collected in previous studies. The thermal performance is evaluated in terms of solar fraction. On the other hand, the economic impacts are quantified in terms of three criteria for economic feasibility, such as payback period, internal rate of return and life cycle savings. In order to explore the benefits arising from different policies, four tariff scenarios are considered. The economic evaluation is positive over all scenarios analyzed, showing savings for both, the consumers and the electricity sector.

> 10.1093/ej/uez060,THE EFFECT OF RURAL CREDIT ON DEFORESTATION: EVIDENCE FROM THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON,"In 2008, the Brazilian government made the concession of rural credit in the Amazon conditional upon stricter requirements as an attempt to curb forest clearings. This article studies the impact of this innovative policy on deforestation. Difference-in-differences estimations based on a panel of municipalities show that the policy change led to a substantial reduction in deforestation, mostly in municipalities where cattle ranching is the leading economic activity. The results suggest that the mechanism underlying these effects was a restriction in access to rural credit, one of the main support mechanisms for agricultural production in Brazil."
> 10.1175/BAMS-D-20-0029.1,A Storm Safari in Subtropical South America Proyecto RELAMPAGO,"This article provides an overview of the experimental design, execution, education and public outreach, data collection, and initial scientific results from the Remote Sensing of Electrification, Lightning, and Mesoscale/Microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations (RELAMPAGO) field campaign. RELAMPAGO was a major field campaign conducted in the Cordoba and Mendoza provinces in Argentina and western Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil in 2018-19 that involved more than 200 scientists and students from the United States, Argentina, and Brazil. This campaign was motivated by the physical processes and societal impacts of deep convection that frequently initiates in this region, often along the complex terrain of the Sierras de Cordoba and Andes, and often grows rapidly upscale into dangerous storms that impact society. Observed storms during the experiment produced copious hail, intense flash flooding, extreme lightning flash rates, and other unusual lightning phenomena, but few tornadoes. The five distinct scientific foci of RELAMPAGO-convection initiation, severe weather, upscale growth, hydrometeorology, and lightning and electrification-are described, as are the deployment strategies to observe physical processes relevant to these foci. The campaign's international cooperation, forecasting efforts, and mission planning strategies enabled a successful data collection effort. In addition, the legacy of RELAMPAGO in South America, including extensive multinational education, public outreach, and social media data gathering associated with the campaign, is summarized."
> 10.1016/j.rser.2010.03.041,Genesis and consolidation of the Brazilian bioethanol: A review of policies and incentive mechanisms,"This article aims to investigate the introduction, sustenance and consolidation of bioethanol in Brazil. It presents an analysis of its introductory stage, from the first decades of the 20th century until the early 1970s, when, in a second stage, additional measures allowed for its consolidation and maturity, under the widely known Proalcool. The paper presents a historical reinterpretation of the policies, mechanisms and instruments adopted in both stages, aiming to highlight the economical and political links. It is concluded that the interests of the agrarian elites, operating at the political level, and the fuel supply crisis during Second World War were basic during the first stage, to sustain a productive and logistic capacity and maintain ethanol alive as an automotive fuel. It is also concluded that the launching of Proalcool represented a transition combining the interests of the sugarcane agribusiness, burdened by the drop in sugar prices, and the need to equilibrate the balance of payments due to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Ethanol supply shocks harmed its credibility and its commercial consolidation was only possible through the introduction of flex-fuel vehicles with expectations strongly relying on climate change mitigation actions.

> 10.1038/s41467-021-22840-7,Deforestation reduces rainfall and agricultural revenues in the Brazilian Amazon,"It has been suggested that rainfall in the Amazon decreases if forest loss exceeds some threshold, but the specific value of this threshold remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the relationship between historical deforestation and rainfall at different geographical scales across the Southern Brazilian Amazon (SBA). We also assess impacts of deforestation policy scenarios on the region's agriculture. Forest loss of up to 55-60% within 28 km grid cells enhances rainfall, but further deforestation reduces rainfall precipitously. This threshold is lower at larger scales (45-50% at 56 km and 25-30% at 112 km grid cells), while rainfall decreases linearly within 224 km grid cells. Widespread deforestation results in a hydrological and economic negative-sum game, because lower rainfall and agricultural productivity at larger scales outdo local gains. Under a weak governance scenario, SBA may lose 56% of its forests by 2050. Reducing deforestation prevents agricultural losses in SBA up to US$ 1 billion annually. Deforestation in the Amazon region has suggested to influence precipitation in a non-linear way. Here, the authors show that forest loss is associated with decreasing precipitation after a scale-dependent threshold is crossed, which can cause stress on agriculture if deforestation is expanded."
