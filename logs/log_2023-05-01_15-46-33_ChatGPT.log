> As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I cannot provide real-time information on the specific individuals working on the socioeconomic risks of climate change at MIT. However, I can highlight some key research centers and groups within MIT that focus on climate change and its socioeconomic implications. These groups often involve collaborations between faculty members, researchers, and students. Some of these research groups and centers include:
> 
> 1. MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change: This program combines scientific research with policy analysis to study the interactions between human and Earth systems. Their work addresses various aspects of climate change, including its socioeconomic risks.
> 
> 2. MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR): The CEEPR focuses on the economic, environmental, and regulatory aspects of energy and environmental policies, including the socioeconomic risks of climate change.
> 
> 3. MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI): The ESI works on interdisciplinary projects to tackle pressing environmental challenges, such as climate change, and to promote sustainable development.
> 
> 4. MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative: This initiative aims to integrate sustainability into the core of business education and research. Their work includes studying the socioeconomic impacts of climate change and the necessary transitions for businesses and economies.
> 
> These groups and centers often publish research papers and reports, which include the names of the researchers and faculty members involved. To find the most up-to-date information on individuals working on this topic at MIT, it would be best to visit the websites of these groups and search for recent publications and projects related to the socioeconomic risks of climate change.

> As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I cannot provide real-time information on specific individuals working on the socioeconomic risks of climate change at Stanford University. However, I can mention some key research centers and groups within Stanford that focus on climate change and its socioeconomic aspects. These groups often involve collaborations between faculty members, researchers, and students. Some of these research groups and centers include:
> 
> 1. Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment: This interdisciplinary research institute focuses on finding practical solutions to environmental challenges, including climate change. The institute's researchers work on understanding the social, economic, and ecological impacts of climate change and developing effective policies and strategies.
> 
> 2. Precourt Institute for Energy: The Precourt Institute conducts research on energy technologies, policies, and systems, with an emphasis on addressing climate change and its implications. Their work includes studies on the economic and social aspects of transitioning to low-carbon energy systems.
> 
> 3. The Bill Lane Center for the American West: This center studies the past, present, and future of the American West, with a focus on issues like land and water use, climate change, and sustainable development. Researchers at the center explore the socioeconomic implications of climate change for communities in the American West.
> 
> 4. Center on Food Security and the Environment (FSE): FSE researchers examine the interplay between food security, environmental sustainability, and climate change, focusing on the socioeconomic implications of these challenges at local, regional, and global levels.
