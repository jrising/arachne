> The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Said another way, using subsets of the indicators would have produced a more accurate or robust result, and as new indicators are added beyond this, the value of the analysis was reduced. Vulnerability is not, as section 2.2.3 suggestions, sector agnostic.

It will be also clearer for me, to distinguish what you would consider desirable or optimal (but perhaps cannot suggest to adopt a different approach at this point in time) and what specific corrective measures you think they could and should implement

> Future avoided damages are not calculated correctly. It should be (D^nS_CC – D^s_CC) / D^nS_CC. Suppose that damages without a solution will get 10x worse than baseline under climate change, but a solution can halve that. The current equation produces a negative avoided damages number.

> Problems with indicators:
> - Global Climate Risk Index: (1) Why are both number of deaths and deaths per 100k included? Either you want per person results or not.  (2) Half of this index is economic and all of it is social, and yet it is listed as a physical KPI.
> - The “equation/formula” column includes a mix of formula, methods (“field measurements”—which ones and how are they used?), and units (“€”—what is included in “infrastructure”, e.g.?).
> - There is almost no connection between the indicative physical changes described for physical damages and the KPIs used to indicate them.
> - GDP Growth Contribution: (1) Since Growth is already a log value, it is odd to take ratios of it, and this can produce nonsensical results. It should be a difference.
> - Does Import value index increase or decrease with climate change? It depends upon relative prices, which depend upon relative impacts, so whether equation 3.2 is used is ambiguous.
> - Only market indices are used under economic damages. Economic damages also includes the value (e.g. WTP) of non-market goods (e.g., biodiversity), which is currently missing.
> - Reduced emissions and CO2 intensity are not measures of damages.
> - The air quality index describes itself both as a ranking (which is then a measure of relative damages) and concentrations. Which is it?
> - Mortality rate is going to be falling in some regions under climate change (e.g., Sweden due to less extreme winters) and rising in other places (e.g., Spain). In some regions, it will first fall before it rises. It is not clear how equation 3.2 is used across these cases, or how comparisons can be done between regions and time periods.
> - These need to be scaled to be between 0 and 1, but most of them do not have natural upper and lower limits (e.g., mortality rate, growth rate, etc.). It is not clear how this was done in the case study, or how it is intended in the framework.
> - I do not believe that the vast majority of these KPI can be evaluated under climate change or that the effects of adaptation solutions on them can be measured.
> - Tables 3.2 – 3.6 list various KPI, but in the sole case study, most are not used and others not in this list are used. If these lists are “suggestions”, then why are they suggested?
> 
> For the case study, 5 solutions to heat waves are listed in table 4.1, but only one solution scenario is explored. Presumably solutions are not “all or nothing”.
> 
> No future year is ever identified for the future climate change scenarios.

> According to the various SSP scenarios, Greece will be 50% - 180% richer in the 2050 than it was in 2020. While there are rationales that might justify projecting lower levels of access to electricity or sanitation facilities under heat wave conditions, these are fairly tenuous against the clearer benefits of wealth. In the absence of further justifications, many of the values in tables 4.2 – 4.9 seem arbitrary and subjective.

> This work is meant to be informed by WP2, and that is included in the framework, but it is not included in the case study nor discussed in the construction of KPIs.

> DSI is not an adaptation strategy. It is a step in a planning process, which may lead to some number adaptation policies (including none).
> 
> Based on the proposal, an assessment of avoided pathways would be provided for each demonstrator, but it appears to only be done for MOE. Annex B identifies KPIs for 3 demonstrators and Annex C identifies solutions for 5 demonstrators, but the assessment is only reported for MOE.
> 
> Why is it recommended that teams wishing to apply the framework start with identifying hazards? Often, stakeholders do not know which hazards matter most for outcomes they care about—for example, overemphasizing precipitation changes relative to other hazards that have clearer shifts. They can more readily be usefully engaged in discussions about outcomes of concern. 
> 
> The most important steps, #8 and #9, seems oddly undefined. It is not clear how this was done in the case study, or how any local team would go about it. This requires consultation with a experts in a number of different areas and specific types of information to feed in, but none of that is laid out.

> 
> The identification and evaluation of KPIs are key steps in the TransformAr process. While this deliverable sets out a method for doing this, it leaves many important details unexplained. Please provide clarifications and address the following points:
> 
> 1. **Equation 3.1**: It appears that the denominator should be revised to sum(a_n). Please confirm and correct if necessary.
> 
> 2. **Terminology**: Revise terminology to avoid the use of "Direct" as a synonym for "(bio-)physical." Also, provide clarification that both Economic and Health are subsets of Social.
> 
> 3. **Future Avoided Damages Calculation**: Correct the formula for calculating future avoided damages to (D^nS_CC – D^s_CC) / D^nS_CC. Provide an explanation and example, such as the case where damages without a solution worsen tenfold under climate change, and a solution halves this effect.
> 
> 4. **Problems with Indicators**: Address the following issues:
>    - **Global Climate Risk Index**: Review the inclusion of both "number of deaths" and "deaths per 100k." Decide whether per person results are desired and eliminate redundancy. Additionally, categorize this index appropriately, as half is economic and all of it is social, yet it is listed as a physical KPI.
>    - **Equation/Formula Column**: Standardize content within this column to clearly differentiate between formulas, methods, and units. Specify methods and clarify ambiguous terms, such as "field measurements."
>    - **Indicative Physical Changes**: Strengthen connections between indicative physical changes for physical damages and the KPIs used to measure them.
>    - **GDP Growth Contribution**: Adjust methodology to use a difference instead of a ratio for growth, as growth is a log value to avoid nonsensical results.
>    - **Import Value Index**: Clarify whether the Import Value Index increases or decreases due to climate change impacts and clearly specify when equation 3.2 should be applied.
>    - **Non-Market Goods**: Incorporate economic damages that include non-market goods' value (e.g., WTP for biodiversity).
>    - **Emissions and CO2 Intensity**: Clarify that reduced emissions and CO2 intensity are not direct measures of damages.
>    - **Air Quality Index**: Define whether the index describes rankings or concentrations and ensure clarity.
>    - **Mortality Rate**: Provide guidance on how equation 3.2 applies across regions with varying trends in mortality rate due to climate change.
>    - **Scaling Indicators**: Explain how indicators have been scaled between 0 and 1, given that they lack natural upper and lower bounds. 
> 
> 5. **KPI Evaluation**: Justify the feasibility of evaluating the majority of KPIs under climate change and measuring adaptation solutions' effects on them.
> 
> 6. **Tables 3.2 – 3.6 Utilization**: Explain the rationale for suggesting specific KPIs in the tables, particularly when many are not used in the case study while unlisted ones are.
> 
> 7. **Heatwave Solutions in Case Study**: Address the inconsistency of listing five heatwave solutions in Table 4.1 but exploring only one scenario. Clarify if solutions are modular rather than "all or nothing."
> 
> 8. **Climate Change Scenario Timeline**: Specify the future year targeted in the climate change scenarios.
> 
> 9. **Wealth Projections and Assumptions for 2050 (Tables 4.2 – 4.9)**: Justify the assumptions that produce arbitrary and subjective outcomes. Offer more robust explanations for lower levels of access to electricity or sanitation facilities despite increased wealth.
> 
> 10. **WP2 Integration**: Ensure WP2's informing role is reflected in the case study and the construction of KPIs.
> 
> 11. **DSI Definition**: State clearly that DSI is a part of the planning process, not an adaptation strategy. Define its role and delineate between planning and adaptation policies.
> 
> 12. **Assessment of Avoided Pathways**: Conduct and report the assessment of avoided pathways for each demonstrator, rather than solely for MOE, as proposed.
> 
> 13. **Framework Application Recommendations**: Align framework application recommendations with the need to identify outcomes of concern over specific hazards, as stakeholders may not know the most impactful ones.
> 
> 14. **Clarification for Steps #8 and #9**: Provide explicit guidance on executing steps #8 and #9 for local teams, including necessary expert consultations, information requirements, and methods.
> 
> By addressing these points, the deliverable will be clearer and more actionable for the consortium.
