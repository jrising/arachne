**user**:
> I have recently set up a server in my University office, named ceoe-hypatia. I want to connect to this server within the University network, by from another computer. Should I be able to say `ssh ceoe-hypatia`?
**assistant**:
> You should be able to connect to your server with `ssh ceoe-hypatia` provided a few conditions are fulfilled:
> 
> 1. **Name Resolution:** The hostname `ceoe-hypatia` should be correctly set up in the DNS (Domain Name System) that your university's network is using. If the DNS is correctly set up, then `ceoe-hypatia` would resolve to the IP address of your office server. You could check whether this resolution is happening correctly on the computer you're trying to connect from (let's call it your "local machine") by using the command `ping ceoe-hypatia`. If you don't get a response or the output shows an unexpected IP, you might have to consult with your university's IT department to ensure that the hostname is correctly registered in the DNS.
> 
> 2. **SSH Server:** The server at `ceoe-hypatia` should have an SSH server installed and running. On Unix-based systems like Linux, the OpenSSH server is commonly used. You would generally ensure it's running with a command like `sudo service ssh status` (for systems using systemd) or `sudo /etc/init.d/ssh status` (for systems using sysvinit).
> 
> 3. **Firewall:** Any firewalls active on `ceoe-hypatia` should allow inbound TCP connections on port 22, which is the default port that SSH uses. If your university's network also has a firewall, it should also allow such connections. Adjusting these settings would require administrative access.
> 
> 4. **Network Reachability:** The network configurations on both the local machine and `ceoe-hypatia` should allow them to communicate. If these machines are on the same subnet, there usually isn't anything additional to do. If they're on different subnets, then there may be additional routing configurations required. Your university's IT department would be the ones to assist with this.
> 
> If any of these conditions isn't met, the `ssh ceoe-hypatia` command isn't likely to work. If all these conditions are fulfilled and you're still unable to connect to your server, please don't hesitate to ask for more assistance!
