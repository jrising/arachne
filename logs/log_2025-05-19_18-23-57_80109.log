> Accelerating Investment in Adaptation and Resilience by Economic Decision-Makers:
> Initial Concept Note
> 
> Grantham Institute on Climate Change and Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science in partnership with Marsh McLennan, Paul Watkiss Associates, and University of Delaware, February 2025
> Introduction and Background  
> The physical impacts of climate change are increasing at an alarming rate and have become macro-critical issues, with the budgetary impacts and fiscal pressures from extreme events growing in many countries and significantly affecting the responsibilities of economic decision-makers worldwide. Yet whilst there has been an increase in investment in adaptation, it remains severely underfunded across all countries, with inadequate engagement from Finance Ministers, key economic decision-makers, and Heads of State.  
> To respond to this need, the Gates Foundation is preparing a range of products to inform the adaptation discussions in the run up to COP30 in Belém, Brazil. The overall intention is to build a package of products that can reference each other and jointly create a compelling case for adaptation for COP30. This might be complemented by a communications and engagement effort led by senior economic decision-makers and thought leaders. 
> Work already underway includes a study by WRI to assess the returns to specific adaptation investments using the ‘triple dividend’ framework. This will inform complementary work assembling a collection of “best buys for adaptation” in key sectors and matching this to how to finance them. 
> The Gates Foundation have asked GRI to consider a contribution to this series of products with a focus on highlighting the latest evidence on the macroeconomic costs of inaction on mitigation and adaptation and summarizing the macroeconomic arguments for investing in adaptation for economic and other decisionmakers.
> GRI proposes to undertake a global review and analytical synthesis of the costs, benefits, and potential of investing in adaptation at the macro-economic and macro-fiscal level and complementing this with a set of case studies of countries that have and have not invested in resilience, their success factors and financing instruments involved. Both mitigation and major adaptation investments are urgently needed as the longer we wait the more costly it will get, and the less effective adaptation will be. As a rule of thumb, the costs of adaptation increase with warming, and there are thresholds beyond which some adaptation options are no longer viable. Adaptation is likely to be more effective at reducing losses in a 2°C scenario than in a 3°C scenario.  Whilst resilient development is a necessary condition for reducing climate risk, it is wholly insufficient unless complemented by targeted adaptation investments (see World Bank, 2024). 
> 
> 
> 
> Proposed study 
> Fortunately, there is growing evidence in this area, although assessments differ widely in their underlying assumptions, modelling approach and context. A coherent understanding among policy makers would benefit from assembling and synthesising the existing studies on costs of inaction as well as on the wider benefits of taking action in a compelling way. This includes recent analyses which underscore the substantial macroeconomic costs associated with inaction on climate change.  For example, a report by the Climate Policy Initiative estimates that the global cost of inaction could reach USD 1,266 trillion, considering various warming scenarios and timeframes (Alberti, 2024).  
> All countries are already experiencing impacts of slow onset change and experiencing greater extreme weather event. Assessing the experienced damages from climate change already occurring is a key starting point and can help communicate to MoFs the macroeconomic and fiscal costs already being experienced, as well as analogues from other countries to provide real-world examples.  This also allows MoFs to understand the transmission mechanisms through which climate is likely to affect drivers of growth and spending pressures, and align them to existing national economic modelling frameworks.
> Moving to the adaptation side, what is often unclear is the role of adaptation in dealing with these climate damages, but also how to frame adaptation and conduct relevant analysis to inform macro-economic and fiscal policy and investment. 
> Adaptation has economic benefits because it reduces the risks of climate change, but it has costs associated with planning and implementation. Assessing these costs and benefits is key to building the case for adaptation, and for assessing alternatives, but this analysis is extremely challenging.  This is because adaptation is a response to site and context-specific risks (determined by hazard, vulnerability and exposure) that change dynamically over time and involve very high uncertainty, which in turn affect the level of adaptation needed and the level and timing of its benefits.
> Adaptation is therefore increasingly recognized as a process that requires capacity-building, planning and delivery of multiple types of activities (often in portfolios), rather than a set of one-off decisions. While uncertainty is not a reason for inaction, it requires a different mindset, i.e., to make decisions under uncertainty, and has led to a growing focus on using adaptive management and adaptation pathways (see IPCC, 2022 ).
> Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that adaptation can deliver net-positive economic (societal) benefits. This comes from two complementary areas. First, impact assessments of future climate change identify that adaptation is net-beneficial, with positive net present values or benefit-to-cost ratios (BCRs) e.g. as identified in modelling studies on coastal protection (Hinkel et al. 2018 ). Second, economic assessments of short-term options or projects (early quick wins and no-regrets) identify that many (though not all) options deliver BCRs typically above 2:1 and often as high as 10.     
> However, a number of factors make adaptation challenging to finance in practice. First, often the financial returns from adaptation are lower than the economic (societal) returns. For example, climate smart agriculture delivers much higher economic internal rates of return than financial internal rates of return, because it is difficult to monetize the environmental benefits.    Second the nature of anticipatory adaptation is difficult to justify using conventional economical appraisal, because benefits primarily occur in the future (and are low in present value terms) and there is high uncertainty whether such benefits will be actually realized. This has led to frameworks that help to build the economic case for early adaptation , focusing on no-regret actions, climate proofing planned development and investing in early adaptive management actions to improve future decisions. 
> All of this means that an exclusive focus on quantifying the growing ‘costs of inaction’ and outlining the net-economic benefits of action is unlikely to be sufficient to shift the dial. In simple terms: scaremongering based on ex-ante projections of the costs of inaction and highlighting the net-economic benefits of action alone doesn’t work in creating a compelling case for action at scale.  
> Adaptation, in our view, requires a different framing of adaptation – one that adopts a ‘policy first’ approach that focuses on the actual types of financing and investment decisions that a Ministry of Finance might need to take over the next five or so years - rather than what might be theoretically needed in 2050. And further, creating a more positive narrative on the fiscal benefits of adaptation.  Emerging work shows that even though adaptation often requires increased public expenditure, it has benefits for the public finances by reducing the negative impacts on revenues and reducing expenditure associated with damages, as evidenced by detailed analysis in Austria. 
> Against this background, GRI is proposing to undertake a multi-pronged approach which would include a synthesis of the latest empirical work on the macroeconomic and fiscal costs of inaction, but give greater attention to robust empirical studies which focus on: 
> -	More robust critique of global costs of inaction studies and analysis of information that resonates with MoFs, and case studies on current climate change impacts. 
> -	Analysis of impacts for the public purse and Finance Ministries (including on contingent liabilities, expenditure and revenues), as well as for major players in national economies who wield significant economic power e.g. financial sector and insurance underwriters (rather than whole of economy damage costs). 
> The macroeconomic and macro-fiscal benefits of investing in adaptation and enhancing resilience,  with nationally orientated analysis and real world policy framing (rather than only on global studies of avoided damage costs in the future). 
> -	Real world ex-post case studies, where they exist, of where countries have and have not invested in adaptation / resilience and the differential economic outcomes to provide inspiring examples of success (rather than a focus on ex-ante projections of avoided damage costs) 
> -	Findings which further supplement current understanding of the public and other financing instruments that can meet investment needs (rather than focusing on aggregate investment needs alone). 
> 
> We will also: 
> -	Work with GF to ensure that the product is linked to a legitimate pre-existing process to ensure its findings resonate with the country-owned Paris agreement process. 
> -	Consider what type of analysis and new narratives might help to shift the needle with economic decision-makers before proceeding, learning lessons from what has not been effective previously and taking note of current global political dynamics. The COFMCA will act as a sounding board and we will draw on relevant insights from recent work which reveals some progress but also significant gaps when it comes to integrating adaptation into MoF decision making (See Annex 1)  
> -	Identify key gaps in the evidence and literature for future research efforts. 
> 
> Proposed methodology 
> The proposed study would seek to investigate the following questions:
> 1.	What is the latest picture of costs of inaction studies?
> 2.	What cost of inaction analysis is actually needed to help to inform MoFs (and economic decision-makers)?
> 3.	What is the justification for investment in adaptation – for the economy and for the public finances – and how to do this under conditions of uncertainty?
> We would therefore propose a methodology which consists of:
> -	Drawing on our existing pool of data from extensive stakeholder consultations for HP4 of the CoFMCA and supplementing this information with targeted interviews with a range of Finance Ministries and economic decision-makers to better understand what might help shift the dial on adaptation action. 
> -	Global synthesis of literature covering:
> o	Drivers of macroeconomic impacts from climate change
> o	Review of the macroeconomic costs of inaction, including the fiscal impacts
> o	Ground truthing analysis to compare global studies and information against national data
> o	Review of the costs and benefits of adaptation. 
> o	Analysis of the frameworks for real world adaptation fiscal planning and investment. 
> o	Development of the investment case for adaptation.
> -	Summarising 4-6 major case studies of countries that have and have not invested in national-level resilience, their success factors and financing instruments involved. Examples could include: 
> o	UK experience. The UK has developed an advanced institutional framework for adaptation and is investing at scale, including with macro-economic and fiscal analysis. 
> o	Rwanda. Rwanda is one of the leading African countries investing in adaptation. It has set up an operational Green Fund, and has public and private financing facilities to scale-up, and is starting to operationalise adaptation into macro-economic and fiscal planning. 
> o	Looking at the macroeconomic and productivity benefits from investing in adaptation measures in a range of key sectors in countries such as Nigeria, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Brazil, and Indonesia (providing analysis has been done on fiscal impacts).  
> o	Others to be selected in close collaboration with Gates Foundation and the Coalition of Finance Ministers 
> This would result in a short 20-30 page report with 2-4 page Ministerial / C-Suite summary. 
> The project would kick-start in March and a zero draft for review delivered by the end of June, 2025, a first full draft in September, 2025, and final ahead of COP30 in November, 2025. 
> We would look to leverage existing work which GRI and its network is involved in, including:
> -	GRI has recently advised the Helsinki Principle 4 (HP4) workstream under the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, which works towards the overall aim of mainstreaming climate action into economic and fiscal policy. GRI’s recent work for the coalition involves advisory across a number of areas drawing on the following outputs: 
> o	A Global Survey of Finance Ministries: The world’s first comprehensive survey of MoFs focused on understanding their most pressing climate policy questions, existing analytical tools and capabilities for addressing them, and the gaps that exist. 59 members responded to the survey, and 15 participated in semi-structured interviews.
> o	Compendium of Practice from a Global Community of Finance Ministries and Leading Organizations – Summary Report: This compendium summarizes 130 contributions from 70 institutions, including 41 contributions from 19 MoFs. It captures existing and frontier economic analysis and modelling work, examples of analysis in action, and lessons learnt and opportunities for building analytical capability. It includes 10 model types and more than 30 specific models in use.
> o	Thematic Reports: The thematic reports are a series planned by leading global experts on the analytical tools that can be used for addressing a different priority policy issue. The first two included in this batch are: 1) How Finance Ministries Can Assess and Manage Physical Climate Risks and Adaptation; and 2) How Finance Ministries Can Assess the Fiscal Challenges and Opportunities from Green and Resilient Transitions.
> -	GRI is developing a relatively comprehensive assessment of the costs of inaction for the United Kingdom, with a collection of techniques that can rapidly be applied to data-poor countries. These include (1) an impact model emulation approach to translate existing studies to alternative climate and adaptation scenarios; (2) global assessments of trade spill-overs, climate-induced macroeconomic catastrophes, and biodiversity loss valuation; and (3) a standardised process to project the costs of missing risks.
> -	The University of Delaware has developed a systematic meta-analysis of empirical macroeconomic impact models, to produce best-estimates of GDP loss under climate change.
> -	GRI’s work on adaptation, insurance and resilience, including the Zurich Climate Resilience Alliance, the ATTENUATE project, TPI’s ASCOR tool on sovereign risk rating and work on communication for decision makers
> -	Paul Watkiss Associates (PWA) has led the international analysis of adaptation costs in UNEP’s adaptation finance gap analysis. This has assessed the adaptation finance needs for all countries. 
> -	PWA has also developed a detailed analysis of the costs of adaptation for the UK, working with the UK Finance Ministry (HMT), and assessed the costs and benefits of adaptation investment on the economy and public finances using macro-economic models.  Similar work is now underway in Rwanda. PWA is also developing adaptation investment plans for Cambodia, Bhutan and Nepal, working with ADB and ministries of Finance in the respective countries.
> -	Marsh McLennan’s deep-rooted insights on physical risks, financial instruments including role of insurance and protection gap
> -	A recent report produced by the Global Finance and Economy Group at ECI in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) which highlights that investment in climate adaptation is not just a cost but a crucial driver of economic security and growth. It presents a strong fiscal case for adaptation, emphasizing the need for integrating it into fiscal policies, aligning public spending with resilience goals, mobilizing private investment, and investing in data for informed decision-making. 
> We will also look to feed the results of the work into:
> •	The cross-cutting adaptation workstream of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action 
> •	The IHLEG process, which is feeding into the Baku to Belem climate finance roadmap 
> Proposed Team 
> This project would be led day to day by James Rising and Daniela Baeza Breinbauer supported by a senior expert group who will provide guidance and substantial inputs consisting of Swenja Surminski, and Paul Watkiss. The team will also be guided and supported by GRI’s team working with the Coalition of Finance Ministers, Nick Godfrey and Hipolito Talbot-Wright as well as Bob Ward. 
> We will also look to supplement the above with some expertise from Rwanda via Paul Watkiss Associates and senior expertise on adaptation financing. 
> The work programme will be overseen and championed by Lord Nicholas Stern and Amar Bhattacharya, as part of GRI’s work with the Coalition of Finance Ministers.

> Annex 1: Key messages from recent draft report for Coalition of Finance Ministers  
> 
> This work shows that: 
> -	There is clear evidence that physical climate risks are having already major fiscal implications for most countries around the world: increased disaster relief and recovery spending, rising costs for infrastructure maintenance and climate-proofing, potential revenue losses from climate-vulnerable sectors, need to allocate budget for climate adaptation measures. 
> -	Current macro-economic tools and models do often not provide the most suitable angle to determine scale, urgency and complexity of physical climate risks. There is a need for balance between detailed analysis and practical decision-making. Independent advice on which tools, data, and models to use, as well as guidance on what to avoid is lacking.
> -	Utilizing tools and analysis for accessing climate finance and for prioritising adaptation within public finance strategies is very undeveloped. As above, whilst there has been an increase in investment in adaptation, it remains severely underfunded across all countries. Total adaptation financing is far below estimated existing and future needs, despite growing awareness of the urgency for adaptation action and the clear high benefit–cost ratio of investment.  This applies to both developing and developed countries, where strategies such as insurance and physical protection infrastructure are in need of innovation.
> -	There are significant capacity gaps within MoFs to handle complexity, interdependencies and new pressing policy questions. A handful of key policy questions were identified as particular urgent and underdeveloped: identifying the biggest resilience gaps and how best to address them; financing adaptation in the face of budget constraints, increasing costs of capital and growing liabilities;  tracking effectiveness of adaptation investments in the absence of clear adaptation targets; ensuring that the transition is resilient by considering physical risk levels when decarbonizing sectors and systems; demonstrate adaptation progress to attract investors and not get penalized for physical risk levels; addressing growing protection gaps.

> Can you translate this into a clear background 2 pager explaining the project, its objectives, and why we want to do interviews.
> As additional background, you may use information from this recent update on the project work:
> ===
> Here are some developments:
> 
> Literature review:
>  - We have started collecting evidence on impacts on macroeconomic variables and macro-fiscal outcomes (see list of variables of interest).
>  - Collected country-level GDP/growth outcomes will be combined with country-level outcomes from my macro meta-analysis (presentation with preliminary results).
>  - We are developing an AI-based approach to identify relevant literature (filtering through 40,000 papers identified through Scopus and Web of Science).
> 
> Case studies
>  - Paul, Daniela, and I have identified a proposed set of case studies: UK, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh.
>  - We are iterating on a set of overarching messages to craft the case studies around. The current list is something like this:
>   1. “Government support is often needed to resolve market failures and achieve full adaptation benefits.”
>   2. “Adaptation investments can yield substantial returns, particularly when considering the broad co-benefits and opportunities created, although economic returns often surpass financial ones.”
>   3. “Adaptation investments must be tailored to specific contexts but offer significant benefits on a national scale, supporting national economic objectives and enhancing fiscal health.”
>   4. “Adaptation projects can unlock new international funding, including concessionary finance, technical assistance, and capacity building.”
>   5. “Investing in resilience can address systemic risks and help achieve national development plans.”
>   6. “There are abundant opportunities for adaptation, decarbonization, and development to effectively work together, by overcoming challenges related to coordination and market dynamics, and thereby crowd in private finance."

> ### Project Background and Objectives
> 
> **Project Title:** Accelerating Investment in Adaptation and Resilience by Economic Decision-Makers
> 
> **Partners:** Grantham Institute on Climate Change and Environment (LSE), Marsh McLennan, Paul Watkiss Associates, and University of Delaware
> 
> **Funded by:** The Gates Foundation
> 
> #### Introduction & Context
> 
> As climate change continues to intensify, it imposes severe fiscal pressures on economies worldwide. The urgency for adaptation investment grows, yet it remains critically underfunded. Finance Ministers and key economic decision-makers are crucial in bridging this gap, but require compelling, evidence-based arguments to prioritize adaptation alongside mitigation efforts.
> 
> The project aims to address this need by creating a compelling body of work that highlights the macroeconomic costs of inaction and the substantial benefits of strategic investment in climate adaptation. This work will support informed discussions and policymaking leading up to COP30 in Belém, Brazil.
> 
> #### Objectives
> 
> 1. **Review & Synthesis:** Conduct a comprehensive global review of existing literature to assess the economic costs of inaction versus the benefits of adaptation investments.
> 2. **Case Studies Development:** Analyze the adaptation outcomes in countries like the UK, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh, focusing on success factors, financing mechanisms, and national-scale benefits.
> 3. **Promote Evidence-Based Policy:** Provide Finance Ministries with actionable insights and tailored frameworks for integrating adaptation into fiscal planning and economic strategies.
> 4. **Inform Decision-Makers:** Develop strategies to communicate the fiscal and economic advantages of adaptation, including its role in unlocking international funding and supporting national development objectives.
> 
> #### Why We Want to Conduct Interviews
> 
> To achieve the objectives above, it is critical to understand the real-world needs and constraints of Finance Ministries and economic decision-makers. Interviews with these stakeholders will provide:
> 
> - **Contextual Insights:** Direct feedback on the relevance and applicability of existing macroeconomic models and cost assessments, ensuring the synthesis aligns with the knowledge gaps and decision-making processes in Finance Ministries.
> 
> - **Experience Sharing:** Valuable case study data from countries that exemplify successful adaptation strategies or face challenges in implementation, thereby providing nuanced, context-specific narratives.
> 
> - **Actionable Recommendations:** Perspectives on which types of investments are most compelling, under what circumstances, and how international funding and policy dynamics can be optimized to support adaptation efforts.
> 
> - **Validation & Feedback:** A platform to test preliminary findings, gather expert validation, and refine communications to better resonate with economic policymakers and influencers.
> 
> #### Methodology & Approach
> 
> The project will employ a mix of literature reviews, country-specific data synthesis, and interviews to:
> 
> - **Analyze Macroeconomic Impact:** Utilize a blend of macroeconomic models, empirical studies, and AI-aided literature review to assess the economic implications of adaptation.
> - **Develop Case Studies:** Focus on real-world examples to illustrate economic outcomes of adaptation investments, tailor messages to resonate with national economic priorities, and explore sustainable financing options.
> - **Iterative Feedback:** Engage stakeholders continuously throughout the project to ensure the findings are relevant, credible, and poised to drive policy action.
