> How can I combine two dictionaries in Julia, so I get the union of their keys?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve the union of two dictionaries in Julia through the `merge()` function. It combines two dictionaries into one, and in the case of keys that exist in both, it will prefer the one from the second dictionary.

> ```julia
> dict1 = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c"=> 3)
> dict2 = Dict("d" => 4, "e" => 5, "b"=> 7)
> 
> dict3 = merge(dict1, dict2)
> ```
> 
> In the resulting `dict3`, it will contain the union of `dict1` and `dict2`. In cases where the same key exists in both dictionaries (like "b" here), the value from `dict2` (7) will be used.
