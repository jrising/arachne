> What would someone who had a "readership" at Oxford be known as to a contemporary in the 16th century. I'm using John Dee in a story, and I wonder if he would have been called Dr. Dee.
**assistant**:
> In the 16th century, the title "reader" at Oxford would typically refer to someone who held a formal teaching position, similar to a professor today. If John Dee held such a position, he would most commonly be referred to based on his academic qualifications and honors.
> 
> John Dee was indeed a highly educated and respected scholar, holding both a Bachelor and a Master of Arts from St. John's College, Cambridge. In 1547, he was subsequently invited to lecture on Euclidean geometry at the University of Paris, demonstrating his scholarly reputation.
> 
> Given his extensive education and his eventual honorary doctorate in law from the University of Prague, it is quite plausible that contemporaries would refer to him as "Dr. Dee," especially within academic or formal settings.
> 
> So, in your story, it would be accurate and appropriate to refer to him as "Dr. Dee," aligning with his recognition and status as a highly learned individual.
**user**:
> Or would Professor Dee be better?
**assistant**:
> In the context of the 16th century, "Professor Dee" would not be entirely accurate since the formal title of "professor" as we understand it today wasn't widely used in English universities at that time. Instead, "Doctor" or "Mr." were more common titles.
> 
> Given that John Dee held a significant educational background and was influential in scholarly circles, referring to him as "Dr. Dee" would be more historically credible and appropriate. So, I recommend using **Dr. Dee** in your story for authenticity.
