**user**:
> I have just gotten additional direction on how to fill out an "Impact, engagement, and dissemination plan" document for a grant proposal. Here is the current plan:
> ---
> The NOWASTING project aims to generate impactful outcomes by addressing the complex challenges of food security, nutrition, and health in the face of climate change. This Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan outlines the strategies and activities to achieve tangible results, engage stakeholders, and maximize the project’s influence on policy and practice.
> 
> 
> Goal and Objectives
> 
> The overarching goal of the project is to improve the resilience and adaptive capacity of small-holder farmers and fishers in Nigeria and Senegal, with a focus on enhancing food security, nutrition, and health outcomes in the context of climate change. The specific objectives of the Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan are as follows:
> 
> Engage stakeholders at all levels to co-create solutions and ensure the relevance and feasibility of project outcomes.
> Develop and utilize tools, datasets, and models to support decision-making and build local capacity.
> Disseminate project findings widely to inform policy and practice, targeting policymakers, practitioners, and the broader public.
> Foster collaborations and partnerships for sustainability and long-term impact beyond the project lifespan.
> 
> Stakeholder Engagement
> 
> 
> NOWASTING is a stakeholder-driven project, aimed at supporting small-holder farmers and fishers with salient data, accessible tools, and local capacity-building. Stakeholder engagement ensures that the research is grounded in real-world contexts, aligns with stakeholder needs, and maximizes the chances of uptake and implementation. The core stakeholder engagement activities will take place under WP1, and are described there. This document will focus out the outcomes envisioned from these meetings and the broader community engagement associated with the work. The aim is to address producer behaviors and co-develop new adaptation practices through decision-science approaches.
> 
> Our stakeholder engagement strategy includes the following:
> 
> 
> Workshops and Forums: Organize stakeholder workshops and forums to facilitate collaboration, build trust, and co-design project activities. Engage representatives from food-insecure communities, small-holder producers, fisher groups, food supply chain firms, and local/national government.
> Co-creation of Scenarios: Collaborate with stakeholders to develop plausible future climate and socio-economic scenarios, reflecting local contexts and addressing real-world risks and opportunities.
> Ongoing Dialogues: Establish regular communication channels with stakeholders, such as community advisory boards and periodic meetings, to maintain engagement, gather feedback, and ensure continued co-design and adaptation.
> 
> 
> Tools and Dataset Development
> 
> NOWASTING aims to provide accessible tools, datasets, and models that support evidence-based decision-making, enhance understanding, and foster local capacity-building. Key considerations for tools and dataset development include:
> 
> 
> Food Security Futures Explorer: Develop an interactive online platform that integrates project data, including climate projections, crop suitability, fishery productivity, and nutritional content. The Explorer will enable stakeholders to simulate different scenarios, assess risks, and explore adaptation options.
> Data Accessibility: Ensure open access to all project datasets and models through an online repository, enabling researchers and stakeholders to access and use the information for their own analyses and applications.
> Local Capacity-building: Design training programs, workshops, and webinars aimed at empowering stakeholders, researchers, and students in the use and interpretation of the tools, datasets, and models developed within the project.
> 
> 
> All of the results produced by the project will be made available online, as downloadable datasets and visualizations. This will include: (1) spatiotemporal climate projections for the co-designed scenarios; (2) effects of climate change on the crop suitability and productivity; (3) effects of climate change on fisheries productivity (4) effects of climate change on the composition and abundance of fish species and agricultural crops, and the consequences for the consumption and nutrition content of such food production; (5) projections of food production and local food availability across different socioeconomic and climate scenarios; (6) measuring possible nutrient gap or degree of suboptimal dietary intake of key nutrients for the average Senegalese and Nigerian household (according to income, region); (7) the welfare effects on (agriculture and fish) producers and consumers (of agricultural products and fishes) when harvesting, revenues, prices and product nutrition values in the respective sectors are adversely affected by climate change; and (8) potential future health outcomes from changes in nutrition patterns and under multiple public health responses. Future projections will be made at high resolution and through 2050.
> As part of this project, we aim to have thorough data collection and organization that we use in our research analysis, and provide ocean observations at the largest possible scale to effectively understand marine conservation. Ocean observations are crucial for informing vulnerable populations about how their livelihoods can be affected (directly and indirectly) by the increasing pressures facing the oceans. This will be also useful for contributing further the relevant stakeholders’ abilities to predict and adapt to such pressures, especially those caused by climate change and human activity.
> 
> Because of the many dimensions of this data, users need tools to explore and understand it. The Food Security Futures Explorer will be the central tool for sharing data and visualizations, and will feature interactive tools to engage a broader audience and inform policy and behavior. The interface will be co-created to support stakeholders in developing resilience to production, nutrition, and health risks. The tool will contain extensive information about adverse environmental changes to serve as an early warning system and for evaluating stakeholder adaptation options. The Explorer will Integrate sustainability and economic outputs into the model to guide producers in decision-making.
> 
> Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing
> 
> Capacity building is a key aspect of creating long-term impact and ensuring the continuity of the project’s outcomes. NOWASTING will support capacity-building and knowledge sharing under two main avenues. First, we will educate stakeholders and young scientists about the modeling of the relationship between climate change, fishery biological and economic outcomes, and the implications for nutrition and health. This will be done through workshops, training through teaching and research, and webinars at institutions in Senegal and Nigeria to share knowledge, improve capacity, and foster collaborations. This will enable communities to mitigate, anticipate and dynamically adapt to changing ocean boundaries.
> 
> Second, the project will support Ph.D. students engaged in related research. 
> Ph.D. students to be advised by the following (1 each):
> Ndèye Fatou Ndiaye (ITA, Senegal)
> Erik Olson (IMR, Norway) to advise Coumba Ndoffène Diouf (BAPDP, Senegal)
> James Rising (UD, USA)
> Kyle Davis (UD, USA)
> Gabriela Mundaca (UD, USA)
> 
> 
> The key activities in this regard are as follows:
> 
> 
> Workshops and Webinars: Conduct capacity-building workshops and webinars at institutions in Nigeria and Senegal to share knowledge, improve local capacity, and foster collaborations. Train participants on the modeling relationship between climate change, fishery, agricultural outcomes, and implications for nutrition and health.
> Mentoring and Ph.D. Programs: Support Ph.D. students by providing mentorship and guidance. Collaborate with partner institutions to facilitate their research and ensure direct involvement in the project’s activities, contributing to their skill development and building human capacity in the field.
> Curriculum Development: Design a specialized course for master’s and Ph.D. students that draws from project methodologies and results. The course will focus on the interdisciplinary assessment of climate change impacts on food security and nutrition, promoting holistic understanding and expertise in the field.
> 
> 
> Dissemination and Policy Influencing
> 
> Efficient dissemination of project findings is essential to translate research outcomes into policy and practice. Each stakeholder workshop will include discussions to help co-design an effective dissemination strategy targeted at policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders of interest. This information will be used to inform the online tools as well as targeted policy briefs. In addition, we will ensure that key scientific outputs of the work are published under gold and green open-access pathways. The dissemination activities include the following:
> 
> 
> Targeted Policy Briefs: Develop concise and targeted policy briefs highlighting the project’s key findings, recommendations, and potential policy implications. Distribute these briefs to policymakers, government agencies, and other stakeholders concerned with food security, nutrition, and climate change resilience.
> Scientific Publications: Publish project findings in reputable scientific journals, ensuring the outputs are available through gold and green open-access pathways. This will contribute to the global body of knowledge and facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration with other researchers and organizations.
> Conferences and Workshops: Participate in international conferences and workshops to present research outcomes, exchange knowledge, and foster collaborations with researchers, policymakers, and practitioners working on related issues.
> Media Engagement: Utilize various media channels, including press releases, social media, and interviews, to communicate project objectives, progress, and results to a broader audience. Engage with journalists and media outlets to raise awareness about the project’s findings and their implications for policy and practice.
> Policy Influence: Engage policymakers at local, regional, and national levels, presenting evidence-based recommendations for integrating climate change adaptation strategies into food security and nutrition policies. Participate in policy dialogues, providing expert advice and fostering relationships to drive meaningful policy change.
> 
> Metrics and Evaluation
> 
> To assess the effectiveness and impact of engagement, dissemination, and policy influencing activities, we will employ the following metrics:
> 
> 
> Quantitative Metrics: Measure the number of stakeholders engaged, attendance at workshops/webinars, downloads of project datasets and tools, citations of scientific publications, and reach on social media platforms.
> Qualitative Feedback: Gather feedback through surveys, interviews, and focus groups to assess stakeholders’ perception of project outcomes, usefulness of tools and datasets, and the effectiveness of engagement activities.
> Evaluation Framework: Develop an evaluation framework to assess the contribution of project activities to improved food security, nutrition, and health outcomes, considering indicators such as dietary diversity, stunting prevalence, agricultural production, fisheries productivity, and policy uptake.
> 
> 
> Implementation Timeline
> 
> 
> The project will be implemented over a period of 3 years, with specific milestones and deliverables identified for each phase of engagement, dissemination, and policy influencing activities. A detailed implementation timeline will be developed at the project initiation, ensuring coordination among the different work packages and alignment with overall project objectives.
