**user**:
> In Julia, I want to call a function a bunch of times, where all of the arguments are the same after a certain point, but the first few arguments change each time (and are hard-coded). Can I do this?
**assistant**:
> Yes, certainly you can do this in Julia! The feature you're seeking is called "partial application" or "currying", and though Julia does not have a built-in mechanism for it like some other languages (e.g., Haskell), it can easily be achieved with the power of anonymous functions.
> 
> Here's how you might do it:
> 
> ```julia
> # Suppose your original function is:
> function original_func(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
>     # ...function body...
> end
> 
> # You want to call this function multiple times with different `arg1` and `arg2`, but `arg3` and `arg4` always being 5 and "hello" respectively
> partial_func = (a,b) -> original_func(a, b, 5, "hello") 
> 
> # Now you can call `partial_func` with just the arguments that change:
> partial_func(1,2)
> partial_func(3,4)
> ```
> 
> In this example, `partial_func` is a new function that takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and passes those along to `original_func` along with the "fixed" arguments `5` and `"hello"`. You can then call `partial_func` as many times as you like, with different arguments each time, without having to specify `5` and `"hello"` over and over. 
> 
> This will work as long as your 'fixed' arguments are in the last positions and the changing ones are in the first positions. If you have a more complex situation, you might need to create a custom solution, or consider restructuring your original function.
