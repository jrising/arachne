> Can a LEONTIEF'S OPEN MODEL be expressed as an equivalent LEONTIEF'S CLOSED MODEL with just an extra industry for final demand. Basically, a block matrix like this:

> In essence, your question is about the transformation of an open Leontief model to a closed model.

> Leontief's open model, commonly known as the input-output model, describes the interdependence between different industries of an economy, taking into account the demand from the final consumers. This model doesn't account for ‘value added’ in its system of equations and the components (aside from primary inputs) are treated as fully recycled within the economy. 
> 
> On the other hand, the closed model also takes into account the sectors of an economy that provide the "value added" or primary inputs (like wages, rents, taxes, etc.), which are human labor, natural resources, and the influence of taxes and profits. 
> 
> The idea to represent the open model as a closed model by adding an extra industry for final demand—as a block matrix like `(Z f) (v 0)`—is interesting, but it might not fully capture the transformation from an open model to a closed model because of its oversimplified nature. 
> 
> In the closed model, the non-industry sectors (value-added sectors) don't just 'absorb' the final demand, they also interact with industry sectors in a myriad of ways, contributing to the output of the industry sectors. That is why, in traditional closed model representations, there are also conversational coefficients that show how much of each non-industry sector goes to each industry sector. The closed model's representation is typically a more complex square matrix that involves feedback effects, where each row represents not only an industry but also a non-industry sector, and value-added components are treated as endogenous and not exogenous.
> 
> However, your idea can work as an approximation or to set up a specific kind of model where value-added components are treated as totally exogenous, i.e., they are determined outside of the model and don't affect the rest of the economy. This kind of model would see final demand as a 'sector' that just draws goods and services out of the industries, and 'value added' as a sector that just inputs goods and services into industries.
> 
> In conclusion, your suggestion could work under certain conditions, but it wouldn't represent a fully closed model as traditionally defined. To accurately represent the structure of a Leontief’s closed model, you would have to include additional interactions between the value-added sectors and the rest of the economy.
**user**:
> Your answer suggests that a Leontief closed model is strictly more complete than an open model-- it can represent everything an open model can, plus extra endogeneity. Is that true?
**assistant**:
> In the context of Leontief input-output models, it's essential to clarify the distinction between open and closed models to address your question accurately.

> - **Open Leontief Model**: This model considers interactions among sectors within an economy along with external trade relationships. It typically includes final demand and primary inputs (such as labor, capital, etc.), but it does not incorporate the concept of value-added explicitly within the framework. The open model focuses on the flow of goods and services between sectors and transactions with the rest of the world without detailing the value-added processes within sectors.
> 
> - **Closed Leontief Model**: In contrast, the closed model not only includes the intersectoral relationships but also captures the value-added processes within sectors, such as wages, profits, and other components that contribute to the value of outputs. This model provides a more comprehensive representation of the economy by accounting for the value creation within sectors in addition to the direct interdependencies among sectors.
> 
> Now, to address your question: **Is a Leontief closed model strictly more complete than an open model?**
> 
> Yes, in terms of economic depth and endogeneity, the closed Leontief model is indeed more comprehensive than the open model. The closed model not only encompasses all the features of the open model (intersectoral dependencies and external trade) but also introduces the concept of value-added components, making it a more detailed and realistic representation of economic activities.
> 
> By incorporating value-added factors, the closed model recognizes the internal dynamics of sectors, the distribution of income, and the contribution of different factors of production to final outputs. This endogenous treatment of value-added components enhances the realism and analytical power of the model, enabling a more nuanced analysis of economic relationships and policies.
> 
> Therefore, while both open and closed Leontief models serve specific analytical purposes, the closed model offers a higher level of completeness and internal consistency by explicitly addressing the value-added processes within sectors, making it a more comprehensive framework for economic analysis and policy evaluation.
