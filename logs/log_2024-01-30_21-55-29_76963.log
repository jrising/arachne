> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon a report (Dewberry Engineers 2018) which has identified the following issues and data requirements for recreation:

> In a bid to enhance the spatial planning process for Delaware's ocean and bay, a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018) has highlighted several key issues and data requirements in relation to recreational activities. These issues, among them understanding recreational patterns, finding suitable sites for artificial reefs, and reducing conflicts between various recreational and commercial activities, underscore the need for comprehensive data.
> 
> Although the report delineates the necessity of data on vessel traffic, human and cultural use areas, water quality, and more, the gaps in this data represent a significant impediment to the planning process. 
> 
> For instance, complete vessel traffic information, specifically Automatic Identification Systems data, is crucial to minimize conflicts between different activities like recreational fishing, tour boating, and charter fishing routes. Yet, there is a clear lack of comprehensive, accessible data that can provide this level of detail.
> 
> Moreover, understanding human and cultural use areas requires more than just broad stroke data; it requires granular, localized information that can help ascertain how best to integrate these interests within the broader framework of the planning process.
> 
> Finally, water quality data, especially with respect to marine debris, harmful algal blooms, and oil spills, holds critical significance. There remain, however, gaps in the extent to which these data can provide a clear picture of the threats to recreational activities or the potential for conflict with other uses.
> 
> This snapshot of the issues and data requirements, as identified in the report, brings to the forefront the necessity to address the data gaps and evolve a more informed planning process for Delaware's ocean and bay spaces.
