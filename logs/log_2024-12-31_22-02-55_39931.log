> In python, I am running a command and collecting the output with subprocess.run. I've noticed that sometimes these commands include text UI downloads, which turn into a gazillion lines updating the progress bar. Is there a way to ignore this (i.e., just get the last result of the text manipulations)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can capture only the final state of the output from a command that includes frequent updates like download progress bars by using `subprocess.PIPE` and post-processing the output to only keep relevant information.

**user**:
> I didn't mean to always grab the last line. In the case where there's a progress bar somewhere in the middle of the output, I just want the final state of that line of text that keeps getting overwritten by progress-bar-manipulations. Can I do that?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can capture the final state of a line that is being updated by an application that writes a progress bar to the terminal. This is generally done by redirecting the standard output and filtering for the specific line that is being updated.
> 
> One approach is to read the output in real time and keep track of the last occurrence of the relevant line. This can be a little tricky, but hereâ€™s a way to do it using Python's `subprocess` and `re` (regular expressions) modules:
> 
> ```python
> import subprocess
> import re
> 
> def run_command_and_get_final_progress(command):
>     # Compile a regex pattern to match the line you're interested in.
>     # Adjust the pattern below based on the output of your command.
>     progress_pattern = re.compile(r'your_progress_pattern_here')
> 
>     final_progress = ""
> 
>     # Use subprocess to execute the command
>     with subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True) as proc:
>         for line in proc.stdout:
>             # Check if the line matches the progress pattern
>             if progress_pattern.search(line):
>                 final_progress = line.strip()  # Update final_progress with the current line
> 
>     # Capture any errors
>     stderr_output = proc.stderr.read()
>     if stderr_output:
>         print("Error Output:", stderr_output)
> 
>     return final_progress
> 
> # Example usage
> command = ["your-command", "arguments"]  # Replace with your actual command and arguments
> final_state = run_command_and_get_final_progress(command)
> print("Final Progress State:", final_state)
> ```

> ### Explanation:
> 
> 1. **Regex Pattern**: Replace `your_progress_pattern_here` with a regex pattern that matches the relevant line of text you're interested in. This is key to capturing the correct line.
> 
> 2. **`subprocess.Popen`**: This is used instead of `subprocess.run` because it allows for real-time output reading.
> 
> 3. **Iterating through Output**: As lines are printed to `stdout`, each line is checked against the regex pattern. When a match is found, it updates `final_progress` to the latest state of that line.
> 
> 4. **Final Output**: After the command finishes executing, the function returns the last captured matching line.
> 
> This method allows you to effectively capture the final state of a specific output line even when it is updated many times during execution. Adjust the regex pattern as necessary to accurately capture the desired output line based on the specific command you are running.
