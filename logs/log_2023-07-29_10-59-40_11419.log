> **assistant**:
> > To create a text field in JavaScript that submits when the return key is pressed but not when shift-return is, you can add an event listener to the text field to listen for the 'keydown' event. In the event handler, you can check if the return key is pressed, and if the shift key is not pressed, then submit the form. Here's an example:
> > 
> > First, you need to include your text field in your HTML. Make sure to reference the ID in the JavaScript event listener.

> >     </form>
> >     <script src="main.js"></script>
> > </body>
> > </html>
> > ```
> > 
> > Now, create an event listener in JavaScript in your "main.js" file:

> > 
> >     textField.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {
> >         if (event.key === 'Enter' && !event.shiftKey) {
> >             event.preventDefault();
> >             document.getElementById('myForm').submit();
> >         }
> >     });
> > });
> > ```
> > 
> > In this example, we check for two conditions: if the pressed key is 'Enter' and if the 'shiftKey' property of the event is not true. If both conditions are met, we prevent the default behavior using `event.preventDefault()` and submit the form manually with `document.getElementById('myForm').submit()`.

> James asked for a way to make a text field in Javascript (using flowbite) that submits when the return key is pressed, but not when shift-return is. Arachne proposed adding an event listener to the text field to listen for the 'keydown' event. She provided an HTML code for the text field and JavaScript code to create an event listener. In the JS code, the 'keydown' event was used to check for the 'Enter' key without the 'shiftKey'. If the Enter key is pressed without the Shift key, the default behavior is overridden and the form is manually submitted.
