>    program
>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)
>    which has a Marine track.
>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
>    or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
>    prospective students.
>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> Dear Dr.Rising,

> I hope this email finds you well. My name is Madison Li, and I am a master student (estimated graduation May 2024)at the University of Minnesota studying Financial Math. Recently, I had the opportunity to delve into your paper titled "Challenges and innovations in the economic evaluation of the risks of climate change " (2022) while exploring topics in environmental economics. Encountering your work was particularly enlightening, especially after reading Weitzman's seminal paper "On Modeling and Interpreting the Economics of Catastrophic Climate Change" (2009), which sparked my interest in investigating the topics of economic evaluation of climate change.
> 
> I was especially inspired by your paper which compared different IAMs and went beyond its current practice and gave an insightful analysis for its advantages and disadvantages. Which also raised questions of how we can produce better economic evaluation for climate changes, considering the complexity of the adaptation process and its modeling challenges.
> 
> I am aspiring to deepen my skills in quantitative analysis and itâ€™s application in economic evaluation. With my passion for climate changes. I am also keenly interested in pursuing a PhD in environmental economics. Your research aligns closely with my academic interests, and I would like to ask if you have any potential research opportunities, research assistantships, volunteer positions, or even opportunities for shadowing that would afford me hands-on research experience in your field. I believe any guidance or advice you could provide would be immensely valuable to me.
> 
> Thank you for considering my request. I have also attached my resume for your reference. I look forward to any potential opportunities to learn from your expertise and contribute to your research endeavors.

> Warm regards,

> The sender, Madison Li, is a master's student studying Financial Math at the University of Minnesota, expected to graduate in May 2024, and recently read through your paper on economic evaluation of climate change risks. They found the comparison of IAMs illuminating and the analysis of their strengths and weaknesses insightful. The specific focus on how to perform more accurate economic evaluations of climate change given the complex processes of adaptation and modeling challenges resonated with them.
> 
> Madison Li conveys a strong desire to enhance their quantitative analysis skills, especially in the context of economic evaluations. This, combined with their strong interest in climate change, culminates in Madison expressing a keen interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. 
> 
> Madison is specifically reaching out to inquire about potential research opportunities, research assistantships, volunteer positions, or shadowing opportunities that would provide hands-on research experience in the field of environmental economics. They have attached their resume and are ideally looking to learn from your expertise and contribute to your research endeavors.
>  
> Madison doesn't directly mention any specific programs but mentions a preference for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program. Notably, Madison did not study at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, and does not appear to be from the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area.
