**user**:
> Are the density of crop nutrients expected to diminish under co2 fertilization?
**assistant**:
> Yes, several lines of research have shown that the nutrient density of some crops decreases under elevated levels of CO2. This phenomenon is known as the "CO2 fertilization effect". 
> 
> In various field experiments, crops like wheat, rice, barley, potatoes, and other major cereals and legumes showed significant reductions in their concentrations of nutrients like protein, iron, and zinc when they were grown at CO2 concentrations expected in the coming decades due to anthropogenic emissions.
> 
> The exact reasons for this decrease in nutrient density are complex and not fully understood, but the mechanism is believed to be related to how the plants respond to having more CO2 available. Higher CO2 levels can stimulate more vigorous growth (often called the "fertilization effect"), but this faster growth can lead to a sort of "dilution effect" where the nutrients are spread out over a greater volume of plant tissue. 
> 
> Moreover, the growth stimulation from elevated CO2 can also change the plant's nutrient requirements and the way it allocates resources, potentially leading to decreases in nutrient content.
> 
> The loss of nutrient density could have major implications for global nutrition, as many of these crops are primary food sources for people around the world. It is an active area of research to understand these processes better and to find solutions that could help offset these potential impacts.
