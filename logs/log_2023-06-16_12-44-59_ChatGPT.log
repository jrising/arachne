> I have a shapefile with longitudes from 0 to 360°. How can I move the shapes beyond 180° to -180° in QGIS?
**assistant**:
> In QGIS, you can manipulate the shapefile coordinates using some built-in tools and functions. You need to move your coordinates from a 0-360 system to a -180 to 180 system. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. **First**, back up your original shapefile! The steps involve changing your data, so you'll want to make sure you have a copy of the original file in case anything goes wrong.
> 
> 2. Open your shapefile in QGIS.
> 
> 3. Go to the `Processing Toolbox`, in the `Vector Geometry` section, find `Translate` tool. 
> 
> 4. Now, you have to decide a condition when to subtract 360 from longitude. If your map is centered at 180 longitude, then all features with longitude greater than 180 should be moved 360 degrees to the left, hence the subtraction. Set the `Translation X formula` as `360 - "Longitude"` when "Longitude" > 180.
> 
> 5. The 'Translate' tool will create a new layer as output. Save the output to a new shapefile.
> 
> Please note that your longitude field may be named differently, so replace `"Longitude"` with the actual field name that you use.
> 
> Also, the translate tool only shifts the coordinates of the geometries, it does not handle situations where a polygon crosses the 180-degree line. If you have such polygons you might need to split them up first.
> 
> It's also worth noting that while this approach should work in many cases, there may be some corner cases where more complex processing is needed, especially when dealing with complex multi-part geometries. In those cases, you may need to use more advanced GIS techniques or custom scripting.
