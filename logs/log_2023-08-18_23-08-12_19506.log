> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. Several species have key habitats overlapping the planning region, according to different designations:
> 
> Biologically important area for North Atlantic Right Whale (See [1]). Delaware includes a part of a migratory corridor.
> Critical habitat for Atlantic Sturgeon (See [2]). This is along the northern portion of the Delaware river.
> Habitat Area of Particular Concern for Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark (both of these in the Bay), and Summer Flounder (just a small part of a large area for Flounder), as well as overlaps with two Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2 areas (Toms, Middle Toms & Hendrickson Canyons and Wilmington Canyon). (See [3])
> Essential habitat for the following highly migratory fish species (See [4]). The essential habitat for most of these species covers a large portion of the mid-Atlantic, of which the planning area is part. The largest collection of these is beyond the continental shelf.
> Albacore Tuna
> Bigeye Tuna
> Bluefin Tuna
> Blue Marlin
> Roundscale Spearfish
> Skipjack Tuna
> Longbill spearfish
> Swordfish
> White Marlin
> Yellowfin Tuna

> Essential habitat for the following highly migratory shark species (See [4]). The essential habitat for most of these species covers a large portion of the mid-Atlantic, of which the planning area is part. The largest collection of these is on the continental shelf.

> Here are additional details from the data sources:
> [1]: Migratory corridor biologically important areas (BIAs) for Cetaceans include areas and months within which a substantial portion of a species or population is known to migrate. BIAs were defined by compiling the best available information from scientific literature (including books, peer-reviewed articles, and government or contract reports), unpublished data (sighting, acoustic, tagging, genetic, photo identification), and expert knowledge. This information was then used to create written summaries and maps highlighting areas shoreward of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that are biologically important to Cetacean species (or populations), either seasonally or year-round. Other BIA types include feeding, reproduction, and small and resident population.

> [2]: Critical habitat is defined as:
> Specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species at the time of listing that contain physical or biological features essential to conservation of the species and that  may require special management considerations or protection; and
> Specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species if the agency determines that the area itself is essential for conservation.
> [3]: A Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) is a designation that encompasses discrete subsets of Essential Fish Habitat (EFH), which provide extremely important ecological functions or are especially vulnerable to degradation. The purpose of HAPCs is to highlight priority areas within EFH to focus conservation, management, and research efforts. These areas typically possess detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability. 
> [4]: Essential Fish Habitat means those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Waters include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties that are used by fish and may include aquatic areas historically used by fish where appropriate. Substrate includes sediment, hard bottom, structures underlying the waters, and associated biological communities. Necessary means the habitat required to support a sustainable fishery and the managed species' contribution to a healthy ecosystem. Highly migratory species managed by NOAA Fisheries include tunas, some sharks, swordfish, billfish, and other highly sought-after fish such as Pacific mahi mahi.

> Delaware marine waters are integral to a diverse range of marine species, serving as a critical junction for their respective habitats. The region is a significant segment of the migratory corridor for the North Atlantic Right Whale, serving as a biologically important area for its transit [1]. Similarly, the northern portion of the Delaware river is highlighted as a critical habitat for Atlantic Sturgeon, providing vital physical and biological features essential for their conservation [2]. The intricate roles of these waters extend to serve as Habitats of Particular Concern (HAPCs) for Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark on the bay, and Summer Flounder, along with housing two Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2 areas: Toms, Middle Toms & Hendrickson Canyons and Wilmington Canyon [3]. Furthermore, Delaware's mid-Atlantic region acts as an essential habitat for a multitude of highly migratory fish and shark species, many of which either reside beyond or are dependent on the continental shelf [4]. From Albacore Tuna to Sand Tiger Shark and Shortfin Mako Shark, the Delaware marine waters play host to a prodigious range of key fisheries, accentuating its ecological significance while underscoring the need for robust conservation and management strategies to sustain these indispensable marine habitats.
