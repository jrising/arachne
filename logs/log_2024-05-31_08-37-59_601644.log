> Moreover,  given that the high cost of retrofits can lead to displacement, some jurisdictions may decide to exempt certain buildings from the requirements of their BPS; this decision may worsen another inequity.  Low-income renters and community members want the benefits of climate policy - just not the risks of their neighborhoods being uprooted by displacement[1].

> This passage discusses concerns that the high costs of retrofitting buildings for better sustainability — under Building Performance Standards (BPS) — can lead to displacement of residents, which can be a burden on low-income renters. Although some areas might exempt some buildings from such requirements to prevent displacement, this can also lead to another form of inequity: such renters and communities desire the environmental benefits that come with these sustainability policies, yet they don't want the potential risk of being forced out of their neighborhoods due to displacement.

Over that last eight months, we have been working with a cohort of six CBOs that serve front line community members, one legal non profit, and six different city jurisdictions to explore BPS Community Accountability Boards and how to ensure they are truly community governed, legally enforceable, and can protect tenants while improving housing. The learnings from that work and the relationships built through it will both inform our work on this project.
> Our government partners have each submitted a letter of commitment and we intend to enter into MOUs with the governments to ensure that we have shared agreements on their contributions to the working group, model regulatory framework development, and assistance with recruitment of pilot buildings if applicable. The MOU will articulate the goals of the pilot and draft shared commitments for prioritizing buildings in disinvested areas for this work.

> This passage describes a collaborative project involving a variety of stakeholders such as governments, technical experts, energy service providers, community-based organizations (CBOs), and legal non-profits. The project aims to work directly with building owners in local areas to explore Building Performance Standards (BPS) Community Accountability Boards. The focus is on ensuring these boards are community-centric, legally binding, protect tenants, and improve housing. The project involves working with six CBOs, a legal non-profit, and six city jurisdictions over the past eight months. Government partners have shown commitment by submitting letters, and there are plans to formalize agreements through Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to outline contributions, regulatory framework development, and goals for prioritizing buildings in disinvested areas for sustainable improvements.

> This passage discusses the projected impacts of a project related to Building Performance Standards (BPS) on pilot buildings and jurisdictions. The impact calculator defines the first year of impact assessment as 2028, with immediate effects on pilot buildings but larger impacts expected to be seen only after the project starts. Jurisdictions such as Boston, Denver, Oregon, St. Louis, and Montgomery County with existing BPS policies will have a compliance period within three years of the project's end, leading to anticipated aggressive compliance improvements. On the other hand, jurisdictions without BPS laws like California, cities within California, and Kansas City are expected to show improved compliance, reflecting the later implementation timelines of those policies. The impact results are based on submissions from multiple calculators, with California cities included in the state estimates rather than having separate calculators.

> Institute for Market Transformation Grant Report
> July 2023- May 2024
> 
> Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) grew and scaled our equitable building decarbonization efforts across the nation from July 2023 to May 2024. Among our other accomplishments, the generous partnership of the Tilia Fund allowed us to:
> 
> Support 40+ jurisdictions to engage with Building Performance Standards (BPS) by providing model law resources, federal funding application support, and curated technical assistance. 
> Work alongside six jurisdictions and five community-based organizations around the country to pilot a Community Accountability Board cohort. 
> Ease implementation for Building Performance Standards (BPS) and related decarbonization policies for varied stakeholders by continuing to provide adoption and implementation resources. 
> Welcome a new cohort of 54 landlords, 8 tenants, and 3 teams to Green Lease Leaders.
> 
> This year was particularly critical for Community Climate Shift because we shifted from planning program components and building diverse stakeholder relationships to implementing collaborative community-government projects on equitable building decarbonization. Over the grant period, IMT: 
> Built Community Climate Shift’s national movement infrastructure to appropriately support a range of partners, including local and state governments, community-based organizations (CBOs), and technical assistance providers, to equitably and efficiently collaborate.
> Developed and implemented a formal governance plan that centers community leadership.
> Supported deep, place-based work in four communities and began outreach to nine more.
> Secured a $5M award from the U.S. Department of Energy to assist local and state governments as they build collaborative climate action plans with community partners. 
> 
> Internally, IMT developed a new strategic plan to inform our efforts over the next three years (2024-2027) and navigated an intentional executive transition with Alex Dews taking the role of Chief Executive Officer in April, 2024. 
> 
> Additionally, IMT elevated our thought leadership in the field by being quoted in 26 articles, including Building Green’s Seeking a Just Transition to a Decarbonized Built Environment and Axio’s New York jump-starts the “buildings decarbonization” trend. 
> 
> We are excited to share our progress in detail below regarding the following deliverables proposed in our May 11, 2023 request.
> 
> IMT provided critical support to 20+ cities and states as they designed and adopted next-generation building performance policies to equitably decarbonize buildings in a way that concurrently tackled cross-cutting community needs. 
> 
> As the national leader on Building Performance Standards (BPS), and the manager of President Biden’s National Building Performance Standards Coalition, IMT offered a variety of BPS supports such as webinars and asynchronous resources to the participating governments in the coalition. More than 20 members received critical technical policy design and implementation support, strategic federal funding matchmaking and application support, and community engagement resources as they designed, adopted, and implemented BPS over this grant period. IMT also provided essential support to jurisdictions that have not yet joined the Coalition to ensure that all jurisdictions had access to these important materials. 
> 
> We accomplished this by: 
> Sharing IMT’s model Building Performance Standard law and suite of supporting resources with over 500 stakeholder who downloaded materials. To ensure the model law resources were widely accessible, IMT shared the resources with over 5,000 newsletter subscribers and hosted a five-part webinar series related to Building Performance Standard law titled Better Buildings for Everyone. The series explored topics of community engagement, legal pathways to BPS, and implementation tools such as Building Performance Hubs with guest panelists including the Public Health Law Center, Environmental Protection Agency, City of Denver, and the Kansas City Hub. The series reached over 850 attendees from across industries and communities including organizations in localities committed to the National BPS Coalition.
> 
> Supporting 23 jurisdictions on BPS planning, 4 on BPS development, and 10 on BPS implementation. For example, we are actively working with the City of Philadelphia’s Sustainability Office on the development of a BPS policy, as well as matchmaking federal grants to support development and forecasting implementation needs. In Oregon, IMT is advising the state’s Rulemaking Advisory Committee on the rulemaking process for their BPS law. 
> 
> City and state governments frequently shared their need for technical assistance to apply for federal funding opportunities that are connected to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act to resource their BPS goals. IMT provided key support such as application drafting, budget document navigation, and invitations for partnership in 23 instances for federal grant opportunities such as the Technical Assistance for the Adoption of Building Energy Codes and the Energy Futures grant. While many applications are still being considered, cities and states who we assisted may receive millions in funding to pursue equitable building decarbonization projects.
> 
> Convening an Advisory Committee of Chicago and Los Angeles-based CBOs and several national healthy buildings organizations, in partnership with NRDC and Elevate, to identify community priorities around health in the context of BPS to begin creating recommendations for expanded policy options. We anticipate this report will be completed by June 2024.
> 
> Support the adoption and implementation of equitable, community-centered building performance policies in multiple jurisdictions
> 
> IMT continues to support jurisdictions as they implement Building Performance Standards to help cities and states ensure their programs are equitable and center community needs. Our work helps cities employ legal defenses against preemption, build relationships with community-based organizations, and create equitable enforcement mechanisms. 
> 
> We accomplished this by: 
> 
> Hosting a webinar, in partnership with the Public Health Law Center (PHLC), for local and state governments to break down the 9th circuit decision on California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley (a successful preemption effort on Berkeley’s natural gas ban) and discuss implications for what policy solutions related to building decarbonization are still viable to undertake, such as BPS and net-zero building energy codes. Additionally, we hosted a ‘Legal Pathways to BPS’ webinar with the Public Health Law Center through the Better Buildings for Everyone series. This event had 126 attendees and laid out the legal pathways creating the right policies to navigate and avoid preemption challenges and potential lawsuits. 
> 
> Sharing our Community Engagement Framework with over 200 stakeholders including governments, CBOs, and technical assistance providers. This resource, as well as our process guide and conflict resolution guide, drove the co-development of energy efficiency and climate solutions that identify and address the challenges, priorities, and aspirations of frontline communities through meaningful community engagement.
> 
> Piloting a cohort of government and community-based organizations, specifically CBOs that serve low-income and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, to evaluate the effectiveness of the Community Accountability Board framework and implementation. The pilot began in December 2023 and will end in April 2024. It is comprised of governments and CBOs from the following cities: Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Portland, OR, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Kansas City, and Orlando.
> 
> Increase the Ease of Scaling the BPS framework while Strengthening Impact
> 
> Streamlining building retrofit and climate action efforts encourages real estate stakeholders, governments, and CBOs to adopt BPS practices. By easing BPS adoption and compliance, we are scaling the BPS framework and strengthening impact across the nation. 
> 
> We accomplished this by:
> Continuing to deploy IMT’s Lindsey Falasca to work at The White House Council on Environmental Quality as the director of Net Zero Buildings. Her recent work included advancing ongoing strategic and data drive processes for robust planning and action using data driven insights to implement the Buildings Strategic Planning Framework, and working towards setting green leasing guidelines that will send a signal to the industry on federal requirements while setting an example for other leasing organizations to follow, thereby moving the market toward net zero emissions buildings. 
> 
> Addressing states that are significantly lagging in adoption of efficient energy codes, and in some locations are looking to roll requirements back or solidify their outdated status through legislative action, and codes that are being repealed and opposed across the nation. IMT’s codes team worked to raise awareness on this issue by partnering with and informing media about the dangers of outdated energy codes, like Bloomberg Business News and The Washington Post. IMT also equipped stakeholders with a toolkit, Taking Action for Strong Energy Codes, which explains how one can play a role in advocating for adoption of the strongest, most efficient energy codes.
> 
> Launching a series on Utilities and Public Utility Commissions as a resource to build institutional capacity and expertise for CBOs to effectively engage in the power sector decision-making process. By demystifying the complex history, operations, and decision-making processes of utilities, this educational content empowers CBOs to confidently translate their community’s energy priorities into actionable technical recommendations. The series highlights real-world impacts and case studies relevant to target regions like the Midwest and Southeast, equipping readers with place-based insights. Providing accessible explanations of utility jargon and regulatory proceedings further enables grassroots advocates to strategically intervene in utility planning and investment decisions, specifically as it relates to advancing equitable building decarbonization solutions. Ultimately, this series enhances CBO leaders’ ability to advocate for energy justice, hold utilities accountable to the public interest, and shape a more equitable, resilient energy future for their communities.
> 
> IMT, with assistance from the Regulatory Assistance Project, developed a model utility data access law in late 2023. This law aims to ensure building owners have access to comprehensive energy data for informed decision-making on energy savings, tenant benefits, and emissions reduction. The data is crucial for building benchmarking, BPS compliance, qualification for IRA incentives, and affordable housing considerations. IMT is collaborating with Building Owners and Management Association (BOMA) to promote this law, with Vermont introducing a bill based on the model. Other states are also considering adopting this model law.
> 
> Hosting three embedded staff positions to support Commissioner Davante Lewis and the Public Service Commission of Louisiana. The goal of the project is to serve the people of Louisiana and advance access to affordable, reliable, clean energy for all. 
> 
> We provide local advisory staff capacity to support Commissioner Lewis to engage community members in activities and initiatives happening at the Commission; craft clear communications about initiatives happening at the Commission; and advise Commissioner Lewis on emerging climate and environmental policies connected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. These staff have supervision from IMT to support their employment and professional development, and are responsive to Commissioner Lewis and his staff in conducting the business of the Commission.
> 
> Strengthen IMT’s support to building stakeholders across the country to comply with Building Performance Standards
> 
> IMT works with real estate owners, operators, vendors, contractors, and other companies to support planning for and compliance with building performance standards. 
> 
> We accomplished this by: 
> 
> Seeding new Building Performance Partnership Hubs in Minneapolis and St.Paul, Philadelphia, and in the Aspen, Colorado region. These Hubs will provide resources and support to building industry stakeholders such as building owners/operators, contractors, tenants, and designers by building capacity and infrastructure to enable building retrofits at scale.
> 
> Additionally, we support our current Network of Hubs (based in Washington DC, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and New York City) by conducting monthly trainings and meetings for Hub leaders, and hosting a joint webinar series to inform stakeholders across the country on the federal incentives and programs that are available. Over 1,000 people attended the webinar series with each Hub hosting a combination of local and national speakers in partnership with the Building Performance Partnership.
> 
> Facilitating holistic BPS compliance support and programs for DC’s real estate community through DC’s Building Innovation Hub. In 2023, the Hub provided critical guidance to owners and operators of 650 buildings to understand DC’s Building Energy Performance Standard (BEPS) through their “Success with BEPS” program. This effort, combined with other Hub activities, helped Washington DC reach a 90% compliance rate with the first compliance period for the new law.
> 
> Recognizing the success of 54 landlords, 8 tenants, and 3 teams through the Green Lease Leaders (GLL) Program. These leaders collectively hold portfolios that cover a diverse range of buildings, from commercial offices to industrial buildings, data centers, retail, and multifamily residential buildings. IMT created and piloted several new GLL application support tools to increase our capacity to invite and process new applicants in 2024 while enhancing the applicant experience. These tools included office hours sessions where applicants could ask IMT staff specific questions about their application, GLL application workbooks for each applicant type and level in Excel, and the opportunity to schedule a one-on-one application review. 
> 
> The Corporate Engagement Opportunities program expanded to include a new Energy Policy Database offering, which connects critical policy information via Application Programming Interface (API) into the tools that the real estate industry is using. Connecting the building stakeholders to the policy requirements via this application allows them to better understand and prioritize building decarbonization strategies.
> 
> Build Community Climate Shift’s national Movement Infrastructure
> 
> During the past year, IMT focused on building Community Climate Shift’s national infrastructure and governance, making initial place-based investments, and securing federal funding. Now, with a strong national movement infrastructure and a deep, trust-based network of partners, Community Climate Shift (CCS) is prepared to support place-based collaborations across more than a dozen jurisdictions in 2024. 
> 
> Highlights of last year’s accomplishments include:
> 
> In May 2023, we convened CCS partners to align on the initial phase of Community Climate Shift implementation and to outline how community perspectives will be woven through all elements of the initiative. As mentioned in our application above, a steering committee composed of environmental justice and community-based organizations now guides CCS’s resource allocation. The core values guiding this work are based on the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing, which include inclusivity, bottom-up organizing, and working together in solidarity and mutuality. We are committed to maintaining a collaborative governance and decision-making model that honors consensus building and authentic, accessible participation that results in informed outcomes toward community-driven solutions.
> 
> In July 2023, The U.S. Department of Energy selected IMT and its partners for a $5M award to support community-centered policy and program creation using the principles of Community Climate Shift. This funding is through the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation opportunity, which is part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The purpose of the grant is to create relationships and shared goals between local governments and community members that produce equitable building performance policies and supporting programs. The funding supports technical assistance providers to manage this process and provide the necessary analysis, research, and facilitation to design and implement place-based equitable building decarbonization programs. As mentioned above in the application, this grant will allow us to support the following state and local governments: California; Chicago, IL; New Orleans, LA; Philadelphia, PA; Washington DC; Kansas City, MO; St. Louis, MO; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington State. 
> 
> In each CCS location, community-based organizations receive direct funding and technical support from decarbonization-focused partner to support community priority climate action. This often includes policy efforts, seeding workforce development initiatives for building improvements, and increasing housing and energy affordability. During the grant period, an initial investment of $580,000 total was made to support four CCS collaborations in Orlando (Grassroots Impact + Central Florida Jobs with Justice), San Francisco (PODER + Emerald Cities Collaborative), Philadelphia (POWER Interfaith), and New Jersey (NJ Environmental Justice Alliance). 
> 
> IMT and our partner, Climate Innovation, conducted ecosystem mapping efforts to identify and onboard CBO partners in eight additional jurisdictions. These CBO partners will lead the work to integrate their priorities into their local government’s building decarbonization efforts. CBOs were selected through a rigorous research and interview process that highlights non-power holders, uplifts frontline community-centered organizations, and prioritizes organizations that have multiple intersections to our key focus areas (e.g. Just Transition, housing justice, energy justice).
> 
> The Tilia Fund’s partnership resourced IMT to accomplish the work detailed above, leading to lasting transformations that move us toward a world where buildings dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions and support our physical, social, and economic well-being. IMT acknowledges the Tilia Fund’s critical role in supporting its efforts to advance building decarbonization and achieve lasting environmental and social transformations expresses deep gratitude for the ongoing support in driving demand for high-performance buildings that optimize energy, environmental, and economic performance.
