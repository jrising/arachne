> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon a report (Dewberry Engineers 2018) which has identified the following issues and data requirements for offshore aquaculture siting:
> 
> Issues:
> • Identify areas suitable for aquaculture and mariculture
> • Identify species suitable for aquaculture
> • Understand and minimize impacts to
> aquaculture sites from proposed projects
> • Better understand ocean health and human
> impacts to water quality such as at sea fish processing					
> Data Requirements 
> • Jurisdictions and regulated areas
> • Abundance and distribution of marine species
> • Synthesized oceanographic parameters
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel
> Monitoring System (VMS)
> • Vessel Traffic – Automatic Identification
> Systems (AIS)
> • Human and cultural use areas
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel Trip
> Report (VTR)
> • Bathymetry
> • Sand and borrow sites
> • Species and habitat locations, including
> benthic habitat
> • Water quality, including marine debris, ocean
> acidification, harmful algal blooms, and oil
> spills
> • Geophysical (i.e. bottom type and sediment
> type)
> 
> Can you provide a brief summary of this material, citing the source and highlighting those data requirements most connected with the identified issues, with a view toward data gaps relevant to Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process? Please do not list every data requirement.

> In the report prepared by Dewberry Engineers (2018), key issues related to offshore aquaculture siting within Delaware's marine and bay areas were identified. 
> 
> Core issues revolved around the identification of suitable areas and species for aquaculture, understanding, and mitigating impacts to these sites, and enhancing the overall cognizance of ocean health, specifically in relation to human-induced impacts on water quality. 
> 
> To address these issues, certain data requirements were highlighted. These fall largely into three categories: ecological data, spatial data, and human activity data. 
> 
> Ecological data requirements include the need for more information on the abundance and distribution of marine species and a deeper understanding of water quality issues. This extends to ocean acidification, harmful algal blooms, oil spills, and marine debris. A greater depth of this data could help in identifying species suitable for aquaculture and in further elucidating the health of Delaware's ocean and bay areas.
> 
> Spatial data needs include more explicit knowledge of jurisdictions, regulated areas, bathymetry, as well as precise locations of specific species and habitats. This information is vital for determining suitable areas for aquaculture and mariculture.
> 
> Human activity data, including commercial fishing efforts (both VMS and VTR) and vessel traffic (AIS), is equally important. Understanding the degree and type of human activity in these areas can help planners minimize the impacts of proposed projects on aquaculture sites and inform regulations for safeguarding both the industry and aquatic ecosystems.
> 
> These data requirements pointed out by Dewberry form the basis for identifying possible data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. For example, if no recent or reliable data exists on the distribution of marine species or there is a lack of comprehensive information on human activity in these areas, these would constitute significant data gaps which need to be filled to support effective planning and management.
> 
> Moreover, this summary underscores the interdependence of different types of data in addressing the highlighted issues. In other words, tackling one issue effectively likely requires addressing several data needs, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive, cross-disciplinary data collection and analysis in sustainable marine spatial planning.

Spatial data needs include information on jurisdictions, regulated areas, bathymetry, and species/habitat locations. Additionally, human activity data, including commercial fishing efforts and vessel traffic, is crucial for minimizing impacts and guiding regulations.
> 
> These identified data requirements reveal potential data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. Lack of up-to-date or comprehensive data on marine species distribution, water quality impacts, and human activity could hinder effective planning and management efforts. It underscores the importance of collecting and analyzing cross-disciplinary data to support sustainable marine spatial planning.
