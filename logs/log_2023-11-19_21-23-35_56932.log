> How do I selected rows in a pandas array based on a vector of booleans, with trues wherever I want to get a row?
**assistant**:
> To select rows in a pandas DataFrame based on a vector of booleans, you can simply use the boolean vector as an index. Here's a brief example:
>    
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # Create a dataframe for this example
> df = pd.DataFrame({
>    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
>    'B': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
> })
> 
> # Create a boolean vector
> bool_vector = [True, False, True, False, True]  # This selects the 1st, 3rd and 5th rows
> 
> # Use the boolean vector to select rows
> selected_rows = df[bool_vector]
> 
> print(selected_rows)
> ```
> 
> In this example, the DataFrame `selected_rows` will contain only the rows from the original DataFrame `df` for which the corresponding entry in `bool_vector` is `True`. The boolean vector and the dataframe need to be the same length.
**user**:
> Now I have a single row from a dataframe. How can I retrieve the value of a given column? It is not a primitive type. When I do row.coords, I still have a Series, and when I do row.coords[0], I get an error.
**assistant**:
> If you have a single row from a Pandas DataFrame and you want to retrieve the value of a given column, you can access it using square brackets with the column name as the key. Here's an example:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # Create a dataframe for this example
> df = pd.DataFrame({
>    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
>    'B': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
> })
> 
> # Get a single row from the dataframe
> row = df.loc[0]
> 
> # Retrieve the value of a given column
> value = row['B']
> 
> print(value)
> ```
> 
> In this example, `row['B']` will give you the value of the 'B' column for the selected row (in this case, the first row). Keep in mind that the returned value will depend on the dtype of the column. If the column contains non-primitive types, such as objects or pandas Series, the returned value will be of the same type. If you encounter an error, it's possible that the value you're trying to access is not directly accessible in that context, or it might need further indexing or attribute access specific to the data type.

**assistant**:
> It seems that the `rows['coords']` column contains a pandas Series with a custom index, rather than a list as you expected. To access the value of the `coords` column in your specific example, you can use the `.values` attribute to retrieve the underlying array and then access the first element. Here's an updated example:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # Assuming you have the following DataFrame:
> rows = pd.DataFrame({
>     'GID_0': ['NOR'],
>     # ...
>     'coords': pd.Series([[(59.75, -180.0), (60.0, -180.0), (59.75, 10.7)]],
>                         dtype='object')
> })
> 
> # Access the value of the 'coords' column
> coords_value = rows['coords'].values[0]
> 
> print(coords_value)
> ```
> 
> With this approach, `rows['coords'].values[0]` will return the value of the `coords` column as a Python list:
> 
> ```python
> [(59.75, -180.0), (60.0, -180.0), (59.75, 10.7)]
> ```
> 
> By accessing `.values[0]`, you obtain the first (and only) element of the pandas Series, which is the desired list of coordinates.
> 
> Let me know if this helps or if you need further assistance!
