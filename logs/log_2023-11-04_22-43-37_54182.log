> When using SpeechSynthesis in javascript, can I feed in words as the speech goes or do I need to have the whole text available at the beginning?
**assistant**:
> In JavaScript's `SpeechSynthesis` API, the speech synthesis is performed on a `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object, and this object must be configured with the complete text before it starts speaking. Thus, you can't feed in words dynamically while the speech is already underway.
> 
> However, you can create an illusion of feeding words incrementally by preparing small utterances in sequences and triggering the next utterance once the previous one is completed. This can be achieved by listening to the `onend` event. 
> 
> Here is a simple example of how this could work:
> 
> ```javascript
> let textArray = ['First sentence to speak.', 'Second sentence to speak.', 'Last sentence to speak.'];
> let i = 0; // counter for the text array
> 
> function speak() {
>     let utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(textArray[i]);
>     utterance.onend = function () {
>         i++;
>         if (i < textArray.length) {
>             speak();
>         }
>     };
>     window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
> }
> 
> speak(); // Start speaking
> ```
> 
> In this example, JavaScript will start speaking the first sentence, and once it finishes, it triggers the next sentence via the `onend` event, and so on. This creates the illusion of feeding words in as the speech goes.
