> The environmental Kuznets curve posits an inverted-U relationship be- tween pollution and economic development. Kuznets’s name was appar- ently attached to the curve by Grossman and Krueger (1993), who noted its resemblance to Kuznets’s inverted-U relationship between income inequality and development. In the first stage of industrialization, pollution in the environ- mental Kuznets curve world grows rapidly because people are more interested in jobs and income than clean air and water, communities are too poor to pay for abatement, and environmental regulation is correspondingly weak. The balance shifts as income rises. Leading industrial sectors become cleaner, people value the environment more highly, and regulatory institutions become more effective. Along the curve, pollution levels off in the middle-income range and then falls toward pre-industrial levels in wealthy societies.
> The environmental Kuznets curve model has elicited conflicting reactions from researchers and policymakers. Applied econometricians have generally ac- cepted the basic tenets of the model and focused on measuring its parameters. Their regressions, typically fitted to cross-sectional observations across countries or regions, suggest that air and water pollution increase with development until per capita income reaches a range of $5000 to $8000. When income rises beyond that level, pollution starts to decline, as shown in the “conventional EKC” line in Figure 1. In developing countries, some policymakers have interpreted such results as conveying a message about priorities: Grow first, then clean up.
> Numerous critics have challenged the conventional environmental Kuznets curve, both as a representation of what actually happens in the development process and as a policy prescription. Some pessimistic critics argue that cross- sectional evidence for the environmental Kuznets curve is nothing more than a

> snapshot of a dynamic process. Over time, they claim, the curve will rise to a horizontal line at maximum existing pollution levels, as globalization promotes a “race to the bottom” in environmental standards, as shown in Figure 1. Other pessimists hold that, even if certain pollutants are reduced as income increases, industrial society continuously creates new, unregulated and potentially toxic pol- lutants. In their view, the overall environmental risks from these new pollutants may continue to grow even if some sources of pollution are reduced, as shown by the “new toxics” line in Figure 1. Although both pessimistic schools make plausible claims, neither has bolstered them with much empirical research.
> In contrast, recent empirical work has fostered an optimistic critique of the conventional environmental Kuznets curve. The new results suggest that the level of the curve is actually dropping and shifting to the left, as growth generates less pollution in the early stages of industrialization and pollution begins falling at lower income levels, as shown by the “revised EKC” in Figure 1.
> The stakes in the environmental Kuznets curve debate are high. Per capita GDP in 1998 (in purchasing power parity dollars) was $1440 in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, $2060 in India, $2407 in Indonesia, and $3051 in China (World Bank, 2000). Since these societies are nowhere near the income range associated with maximum pollution on the conventional environmental Kuznets curve, a literal interpretation of the curve would imply substantial increases in pollution during the next few decades. Moreover, empirical research suggests that pollution costs are already quite high in these countries. For example, recent World Bank estimates of mortality and morbidity from urban air pollution in India and China suggest annual losses in the range of 2–3 percent of GDP (Bolt, Hamilton, Pandey and Wheeler, 2001).

If their assessment of the situation is correct, then industrial society faces two unpalatable options: Protect environmental gains by moving back toward autarky, but reducing global income in the process, or accept much higher global pollution under unrestrained globalization. Moreover, industrialized coun- tries surely must consider the daunting possibility that they are not actually making progress against pollution as their incomes rise, but instead are reducing only a few measured and well-known pollutants while facing new and potentially greater environmental concerns.
> In this paper, we review the arguments and the evidence on the position, shape and mutability of the environmental Kuznets curve. We ultimately side with the optimists—but with some reservations.
> Theory and Measurement of the Relationship between Economic Development and Environmental Quality
> Numerous theoretical and empirical papers have considered the broad rela- tionship between economic development and environmental quality. The focus of the theoretical papers has mainly been to derive transition paths for pollution, abatement effort and development under alternative assumptions about social welfare functions, pollution damage, the cost of abatement, and the productivity of capital. This theoretical work has shown that an environmental Kuznets curve can result if a few plausible conditions are satisfied as income increases in a society: specifically, the marginal utility of consumption is constant or falling; the disutility of pollution is rising; the marginal damage of pollution is rising; and the marginal cost of abating pollution is rising. Most theoretical models implicitly assume the existence of public agencies that regulate pollution with full information about the benefits and costs of pollution control. In addition, they assume that the pollution externality is local, not cross-border. In the latter case, there would be little local incentive to internalize the externality.
> Lo ́pez (1994) uses a fairly general theoretical model to show that if producers pay the social marginal cost of pollution, then the relationship between emissions and income depends on the properties of technology and preferences. If prefer- ences are homothetic, so that percentage increases in income lead to identical percentage increases in what is consumed, then an increase in output will result in an increase in pollution. But if preferences are nonhomothetic, so that the pro- portion of household spending on different items changes as income rises, then the response of pollution to growth will depend on the degree of relative risk-aversion and the elasticity of substitution in production between pollution and conventional inputs.
> Selden and Song (1995) derive an inverted-U curve for the relationship between optimal pollution and the capital stock, assuming that optimal abatement is zero until a given capital stock is achieved, and that it rises thereafter at an

> increasing rate. John and Pecchenino (1994), John, Pecchenio, Schimmelpfennig and Schreft (1995), and McConnell (1997) derive similar inverted-U curves by using overlapping generations models. Recent analytical work by Lo ́pez and Mitra (2000) suggests that corruption may also account for part of the observed relation- ship between development and environmental quality. Their results show that for any level of per capita income, the pollution level corresponding to corrupt behavior is always above the socially optimal level. Further, they show that the turning point of the environmental Kuznets curve takes place at income and pollution levels above those corresponding to the social optimum.
> Numerous empirical studies have tested the environmental Kuznets curve model. The typical approach has been to regress cross-country measures of ambient air and water quality on various specifications of income per capita. For their data on pollution, these studies often rely on information from the Global Environmen- tal Monitoring System (GEMS), an effort sponsored by the United Nations that has gathered pollution data from developed and developing countries. The GEMS database includes information on contamination from commonly regulated air and water pollutants. Stern, Auld, Common and Sanyal (1998) have supplemented the GEMS data with a more detailed accounting of airborne sulfur emissions. Although greenhouse gases have not been included in the GEMS database, carbon dioxide emissions estimates for most developed and developing countries are available from the U.S. Oak Ridge National Laboratories (Marland, Boden and Andres, 2001).
> Empirical researchers are far from agreement that the environmental Kuznets curve provides a good fit to the available data, even for conventional pollutants. In one of the most comprehensive reviews of the empirical literature, Stern (1998) argues that the evidence for the inverted-U relationship applies only to a subset of environmental measures; for example, air pollutants such as suspended particulates and sulfur dioxide. Since Grossman and Krueger (1993) find that suspended particulates decline monotonically with income, even Stern’s subset is open to contest. In related work, Stern, Auld, Common and Sanyal (1998) find that sulfur emissions increase through the existing income range. Results for water pollution are similarly mixed.
> Empirical work in this area is proceeding in a number of directions. First, international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Bank are sponsoring collection of more data on environmental quality in developing countries. As more data is collected, new opportunities will open up for studying the relationship between economic development and envi- ronmental quality. In the meantime, it is useful to think about how to compensate for incomplete monitoring information. For example, Selden and Song (1994) develop estimates of air emissions based on national fuel-use data and fuel-specific pollution parameters that are roughly adjusted for conditions in countries at varying income levels.
> A second issue is that for many pollutants data is scarce everywhere, not just in developing countries. The GEMS effort has focused on a few “criteria” pollutants, so-designated because legal statutes have required regulators to specify their dam-

> aging characteristics. Criteria air pollutants, for example, have generally included ozone, carbon monoxide, suspended particulates, sulfur dioxide, lead and nitrogen oxide. A far broader class of emissions, known as toxic pollutants, includes mate- rials that cause death, disease or birth defects in exposed organisms. Among the hundreds of unregulated toxic pollutants that have been subjected to laboratory analysis, the quantities and exposures necessary to produce damaging effects have been shown to vary widely. Literally thousands of potentially toxic materials remain untested and unregulated.
> Data gathering in this area has started, as some countries have mandated public reports of toxic emissions by industrial facilities. For example, the United States has a Toxic Release Inventory; Canada has a National Pollutant Release Inventory; the United Kingdom has a Pollutant Inventory; and Australia has a National Pollutant Inventory. Using sectoral estimates of toxic emissions relative to level of output, developed from U.S. data by Hettige, Martin, Singh and Wheeler (1995), researchers have estimated toxic emissions in eastern Europe (Laplante and Smits, 1998) and Latin America (Hettige and Wheeler, 1996; Dasgupta, Laplante and Meisner, 2001). However, the underlying scarcity of data has as yet made it impossible to do more than speculate about the shape of an environmental Kuznets curve for toxics.
> A third empirical issue involves thinking about the curvature of the environ- mental Kuznets curve. In most cases, the implied relationship between income growth and pollution is sensitive to inclusion of higher-order polynomial terms in per capita income whose significance varies widely.
> Fourth, it is useful to compare the results of time series studies where the environmental evidence is available. De Bruyn, van den Bergh and Opschoor (1998) estimate time series models individually for Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States and show that economic growth has had a positive effect on emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. They argue that conventional cross-section estimation techniques have generated spurious estimates of the environmental Kuznets curve because they do not ade- quately capture the dynamic process involved.
> Given the data limitations, concerns over appropriate functional forms, and choices between cross-section and time series analysis, structural interpretations of the environmental Kuznets curve have remained largely ad hoc. In view of these uncertainties, few researchers have taken the next step and begun to study the sources of change in the marginal relationship between economic development and pollution.

**assistant**:
> The excerpt you provided is from the paper "Confronting the Environmental Kuznets Curve" by Dasgupta et al. (2002). The paper discusses the environmental Kuznets curve, which suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between pollution and economic development. In the early stages of industrialization, pollution increases rapidly due to a focus on jobs and income rather than environmental concerns, weak regulations, and limited resources for abatement. As income rises and societies become wealthier, industrial sectors become cleaner, environmental values increase, and regulatory institutions become more effective. Pollution levels off and then decline in wealthier societies.

> The paper highlights that researchers and policymakers have conflicting views on the environmental Kuznets curve. Some accept the model and focus on measuring its parameters through cross-sectional observations, showing that pollution increases with development until a certain income range is reached, after which it starts to decline. In developing countries, these results have been interpreted as a signal to prioritize economic growth before environmental cleanup.

> However, critics challenge the conventional environmental Kuznets curve. Some argue that the curve will rise to a horizontal line at maximum pollution levels due to globalization and a "race to the bottom" in environmental standards. Others suggest that even if certain pollutants decrease with income growth, new and unregulated pollutants may emerge, posing potential environmental risks. While these critics make plausible claims, they lack empirical backing.

A literal interpretation of the curve would imply substantial increases in pollution in these countries. Moreover, empirical research shows that pollution costs are already high in such countries.
> 
> The paper also discusses the theoretical and empirical work on the relationship between economic development and environmental quality. Theoretical models suggest that an environmental Kuznets curve can exist under certain conditions, considering factors like the marginal utility of consumption, disutility of pollution, marginal damage of pollution, and cost of abatement. Empirical studies, however, do not consistently support the environmental Kuznets curve, particularly for various pollutants. The scarcity of data, issues related to functional forms, and the choice between cross-section and time series analysis contribute to uncertainties in interpreting the curve.
> 
> Overall, the paper recognizes the complexity of the environmental Kuznets curve and presents an optimistic viewpoint while acknowledging reservations.
