> I'm learning piano, and I'm looking for a fairly early-stage book. I've learned something of several other instruments, but nothing beyond a novice level-- but I can read music, and I've already learned a couple fairly complicated songs on the piano. But I want something where most of the songs will offer only minor challenges, and where I'm looking for generally folk music kind of songs that are easy to sing to with the family.
