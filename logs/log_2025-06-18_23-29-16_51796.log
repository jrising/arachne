> What is the value of the infinite sum A d^n, for d < 1?
**assistant**:
> The sum you're referring to is an infinite geometric series, which can be expressed as:
> 
> \[ S = A + Ad + Ad^2 + Ad^3 + \ldots \]
> 
> This series converges when the absolute value of the common ratio \( d \) is less than 1 (\( |d| < 1 \)). The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:
> 
> \[ S = \frac{A}{1 - d} \]
> 
> So, the value of the sum in your case is:
> 
> \[ S = \frac{A}{1 - d} \]
> 
> This result holds true as long as \( d \) is strictly between -1 and 1, ensuring the series converges.
