> ---
> This report presents headline results on the macroeconomic losses caused by climate change today. The methodology draws on 58 economic models and employs machine learning to develop “best estimates” of the current GDP and capital wealth losses from climate change.
> 
> The research reveals significant disparities in the impacts of climate change across regions and economic groups. The findings emphasize the vulnerability of low-income countries and tropical regions, which are already experiencing substantial GDP losses. Meanwhile, many wealthier nations are seeing smaller impacts or are even benefiting from climate change for the time being.
> 
> Globally, climate change has led to a population-weighted GDP loss of 6.3% in 2022, considering direct, spill-over, and capital losses. The unweighted percentage of global GDP lost is estimated at 1.8%, or about $1.5 trillion, and the difference between those two results reflects the uneven distribution of impacts. 
> 
> Least developed countries are exposed to an average population-weighted GDP loss of 8.3%, and Southeast Asia and Southern Africa are particularly affected, with countries losing an average 14.1% and 11.2% of their GDP, respectively. These losses highlight the disproportionate burden imposed by climate change on developing nations.
> 
> Climate change is also exacerbating existing global inequalities, with many high-income countries currently experiencing net gains, including an average increase of 4.7% to the GDP of European countries.
> 
> With COP28 expected to make progress on the new Loss and Damage Fund to compensate vulnerable countries for natural disasters caused by climate change as decided at COP27, the report also provides impact estimates at the level of relevant UNFCCC negotiating groups (such as G-77, African Group, Aosis, LDCs, and Ailac).
> 
> The analysis also reveals the complex dynamics between climate change, economic outcomes, and capital investments. Low and middle-income countries face significant capital losses, posing challenges to their long-term economic resilience and growth. Low and middle-income countries have experienced $2.1 trillion in produced capital losses due to climate change.
> 
> When GDP and capital losses are combined, low and middle-income countries have experienced a total loss of $21 trillion since 1992 (the Rio Convention). All UNFCCC party groupings except for the EU have experienced total losses, with the greatest losses on the G-77 (which includes high-income countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE) at $29 trillion. These losses are expected to be conservative estimates, since important impact channels and non-market losses are not included in the analysis.
> 
> Climate changes are already depressing economic activity across the globe. These findings underscore the urgent need for global cooperation and support to address the impacts of climate change.

**assistant**:
> ---
> This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic impacts of contemporary climate change, employing an innovative methodology that integrates 58 economic models with machine learning techniques. The objective is to yield comprehensive estimates on both current reductions in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and capital wealth losses due to climate change effects. 
> 
> The results illustrate significant inequalities in climate change-induced economic fallout across geographical and socio-economic strata. More specifically, while low-income, predominantly tropical regions are already confronting substantial losses in GDP, several high-income nations appear, at this point, to be less impacted or potentially even marginally benefitting from the phenomena.
> 
> At the global level, considering direct, spillover, and capital repercussions, climate change has induced an overall diminution in population-weighted GDP by 6.3% in 2022. The unweighted percentage loss in global GDP is approximated around 1.8%, or roughly $1.5 trillion, highlighting the grossly uneven distribution and impact of climate change.
> 
> Least developed countries experience relatively more pronounced effects with an average 8.3% reduction in population-weighted GDP. Southeast Asia and Southern Africa are especially affected, enduring average GDP losses of 14.1% and 11.2% respectively, evidencing the disproportionate economic burden prepared by climate change on emerging economies.
> 
> Simultaneously, climate change seems to be aggravating existing global economic inequalities, with several affluent nations presently discerning net economic advantages; European countries, for instance, observe an average GDP increment of 4.7%.
> 
> In the backdrop of the upcoming COP28 and the preceding COP27 determination to establish the Loss and Damage Fund, the study also delivers estimations of climate change impacts on GDP and capital wealth at the level of response-relevant UNFCCC negotiation groups (G-77, African Group, Aosis, LDCs, Ailac).
> 
> The survey unravels intricate dynamics within climate change, its economic upshots, and investment capital, especially in low and middle-income nations, witnessing produced capital losses worth $2.1 trillion on account of climate change, thereby undermining their long-term economic resilience and growth. 
> 
> When constructed capital and GDP losses are aggregated, low and middle-income countries have witnessed a total loss exceeding $21 trillion since the 1992 Rio Convention. Except for the EU, all UNFCCC party groupings have sustained total losses, the steepest incurred by the G-77, at $29 trillion.
> 
> In light of these findings, it is imperative to expedite global cooperations and initiatives to mitigate climate change impacts, enabling a sustainable and balanced socio-economic growth globally.

**assistant**:
> This paper assesses the macroeconomic repercussions of contemporary climate change using a combination of 58 economic models and machine learning. The findings highlight stark disparities in the impact across regions and income groups, with low-income countries and tropical regions experiencing substantial GDP losses. Climate change exacerbates global inequalities, with high-income countries, particularly in Europe, observing overall GDP gains. The analysis underscores the urgency for global cooperation and support to address climate change impacts, as low and middle-income countries have suffered significant capital losses, totaling $21 trillion since 1992. Effective actions are needed to ensure sustainable and equitable socio-economic development.
