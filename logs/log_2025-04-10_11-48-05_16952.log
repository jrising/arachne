> In the equation editor in google docs, I want to put in some items as "text". I want to include a variable that is the global population, and I want to just write "GlobalPopulation", rather than define a new variable. But it comes in in italics, as though the "G" where a variable on its own. I want it to show the way it would if I did `\text{GlobalPopulation}` in LaTeX. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> In the equation editor in Google Docs, the default behavior is to italicize single-letter variables, which can make strings like "GlobalPopulation" appear as though they are separate variables. Unfortunately, Google Docs' equation editor has limited support for text formatting within equations, unlike LaTeX.

> However, you can achieve what you want using the following workaround:
> 
> 1. Type your equation as usual in the equation editor.
> 2. To insert your text, leave the equation editor temporarily and type "GlobalPopulation" as regular text in the document where you want it to appear.
> 3. Format the text to look like your equation (adjust font size and style as needed) to maintain the same visual appearance.
> 4. Insert additional equation components using the equation editor, ensuring to position them correctly relative to your "text."

> This approach isn't perfect, but it allows for consistent visual presentation. If Google Docs updates its equation editor to support text commands similar to LaTeX, such functionality should make this process easier. Meanwhile, keeping consistent formatting will help blend text seamlessly with equations.
