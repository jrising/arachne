**user**:
> A Japanese person is named "Tsugumi Yamashita". Would I refer to them by their first name, Tsugumi?
**assistant**:
> In Japan, it's more customary to refer to someone using their family name until a closer, more informal relationship has been established. In this case, that would mean referring to the person as "Yamashita-san." The "-san" suffix here is an honorific used to show respect.
> 
> That being said, it depends on the social context and your relationship with the person. If "Tsugumi Yamashita" is a close friend or has stated that they prefer a first-name basis, then you can definitely use their first name "Tsugumi". In more professional or formal settings, using the last name with "-san" is generally preferred. This rule follows regardless of whether the person is in Japan or not – respect for cultural naming conventions is generally appreciated around the world.
> 
> Remember, if you aren't sure, asking politely is usually the best policy!
**user**:
> I am in the US and this person has been in the US academic system. What are they likely to expect?
**assistant**:
> In the US academic system, it is common for individuals to be addressed by their first names, regardless of their cultural background. However, it ultimately depends on the person's personal preference and how they introduce themselves.
> 
> Considering that "Tsugumi Yamashita" has been in the US academic system, they may be accustomed to the casual and more egalitarian approach to addressing people by their first names. Therefore, it is likely that they expect to be addressed as "Tsugumi" rather than using their family name, especially in academic or informal settings.
> 
> Nevertheless, it's always a good practice to be respectful and attentive to individual preferences. If you're unsure about how to address someone, you can simply ask them how they prefer to be called or observe how others address them in a similar context. Respecting their preference will contribute to a positive and inclusive environment.
