> Throughout human history, Indigenous and local communities have stewarded nature. In the present article, we revisit the ancestral principle
> of reciprocity between people and nature and consider it as a conceptual intervention to the current notion of ecosystem services commonly
> used to inform sustainability transformation. We propose the concept of reciprocal contributions to encompass actions, interactions, and
> experiences between people and other components of nature that result in positive contributions and feedback loops that accrue to both, directly
> or indirectly, across different dimensions and levels. We identify reciprocal contributions and showcase examples that denote the importance
> of reciprocity for our ecological legacy and its relevance for biocultural continuity. We suggest that the concept of reciprocal contribution can
> support transformation pathways by resituating people as active components of nature and restructuring institutions so that ethical principles
> and practices from Indigenous and local communities can redirect policy approaches and interventions worldwide.

> contributions to nature—which have received less attention
> in scientific frameworks—but these contributions are not
> unidirectional, because they can generate mutual benefits
> for beings other than humans and for human societies.

> ability, all of which can support the maintenance of healthy
> ecosystems and human well-being (Comberti et al. 2015,

> Box 1. The concept of reciprocal contributions.

> different dimensions and levels.
> In its most archaic form, reciprocity comes from the Latin word reciprocus and means “back and forth, to and fro” (Glare 1982). The
> adjective reciprocal means “given or done in return,” and the noun reciprocity means “a situation in which two parties provide the same
> help or advantages to each other” (Soanes 2001). Some Indigenous traditions include gift economies that embrace reciprocal relation-
> ships—implying generosity by balanced or unbalanced exchange—between peoples and between people and nature (see Mauss 1966,
> Trosper 2009). We adhere to the important characterization of reciprocity proposed by Robin Wall Kimmerer. She notes how, “in a
> culture of gratitude, everyone knows that gifts will follow the circle of reciprocity and flow back to you again” indicating that reciproc-
> ity is circular, not linear (Kimmerer 2013, p. 381). Reciprocity is not only an action or interaction. It is also an experience because
> the learning process implies reflection of lived experiences with other humans and other-than-human beings (Varela 2000). This
> conceptual distinction is important because actions emphasize a biophysical perspective, interactions recognize our ecological role
> in ecosystems, and lived experiences name our cognitive–reflective connections with nature's phenomena. Lived experiences encom-
> pass the biocultural continuity of reciprocity, important for passing knowledge of reciprocity (e.g., Gould et al. 2019, and see box 2).
> For instance, Kimmerer writes, “our elders say that ceremony is the way we can remember to remember” (Kimmerer 2013, p. 383).
> Therefore, biocultural memories of elders and sharing lived experiences with them promote continuity of reciprocity through time.
> That is why we added the word direct because it emphasizes our learning with others.
> We include the word indirect in the definition for two reasons. First, people or communities undertake actions that can have unin-
> tended effects in or far away from their territories and can transform into reciprocal contributions for them and nature. Today, these
> actions can be influenced by social media (see D'Ambrosi 2017, Olafsson et al. 2021). Second, our reciprocal contributions can involve
> indirect negative effects or trade-offs on other nontarget species, people, or ecosystems. For example, in the coastal temperate rainfor-
> est of British Columbia, in Canada, Indigenous peoples used fire as a tool for resource management to foster the abundance of specific
> plants or trees (e.g., Labrador tea, salmonberry) by generating mosaics of vegetation in different stages of succession (Hoffman et al.
> 2017). However, this local management could have had trade-offs for some species such as western hemlock and Sitka spruce that have
> a low resistance to fire (Hoffman et al. 2017).
> We propose to use the adjective form reciprocal and to join it to the noun contributions. The noun contribution means “a gift or payment
> to a common fund or collection” or “to help to cause or bring about” (Kenter 2018). We think that the reciprocal contribution concept
> can be fed into the NCP framework, thereby expanding our collective understanding of reciprocal relations in NCP assessments.
> (2015) biocultural ethic framework has three dimensions:
> a symbolic–linguistic–cultural dimension (linked to words,
> languages, emotions, and narratives embedded in a habitat
> that can trigger biocultural diversity), a biophysical dimen-
> sion (centered on an ecosystem perspective where species,
> such as humans, interact with other species in a habitat), and
> an institutional–social–political dimension (organizational

> Box 2. Fishponds in Patagonia as an example of reciprocal contributions.
> At the southern reaches of South America (Patagonia, Chile), fishponds (or corrales de pesca in Spanish) are a traditional fishing
> method built by Indigenous and local communities (e.g., Chilotes) who used boulders to create a rock wall (see figure 3a). Corrales
> de pesca generated reciprocal contributions for people and coastal biodiversity. They enable capture of fishes such as róbalo (Eleginops
> maclovinus) or jurel (Trachurus simmetricus), and fishponds simultaneously promote increased mollusk abundance and the pres-
> ence of fish-eating birds (Alvarez et al. 2008). These structures are present across many coastal areas in Patagonia (Torres 2009), but
> their density is higher in the Chiloé archipelago (Alvarez et al. 2008). Many Chilotes are mestizos among Williches (a subgroup of
> the Mapuche people), Chonos (canoeist Indigenous people), Spaniards, and Chileans (Saldívar 2017). Indeed, Darwin (1839, p. 334)
> referred to Chilotes as “the inhabitants appear to have three-fourths of Indian blood in their veins.” Chilotes are known as artisanal
> fishers and small farmers who developed multiple marine relations with fishponds (traditional food, ceremonies, and mythologies;
> see Alvarez et al. 2008). In the last century, fishponds were linked to other important cultural spaces on the land, such as artisanal
> firepits (or fogón in Spanish; see figure 3b) that were relevant in the cultural continuity of marine traditions. Particularly, on Chiloé
> island, a family fished and gathered using a fishpond, and then carried their catch to the artisanal firepit, where they were stored or
> cooked. Around the firepit, elders, adults, and children shared food, oral stories, and management guidelines about the sea and fish-
> ponds (Hilda Gallardo, Chiloté elder, Punta Arenas, personal communication, 7 December 2020). Between the 1960s and the 1980s,
> traditional uses of fishponds started to decline for multiple reasons (other fishing methods, migration from urban to rural areas,
> megathrust earthquake), including their prohibition for many years because of a Chilean fishing law that banned all permanent fishing
> methods (Alvarez et al. 2008). Currently, corrales de pesca are legally recognized as archaeological monuments. Many Indigenous and
> local communities note their importance as a customary practice to apply to marine and coastal areas for Indigenous peoples. Likely,

> Water gathers people for restoration movements. Worldwide, there are many citizen programs for restoring rivers, creeks, wetland,
> and small lagoons. Restoration practices can promote a circle of reciprocity in emotional, educational, economic, and political spheres
> in cities (see Murphy et al. 2021). For example, in the city of Victoria (Canada), the Bowker Creek Restoration Plan is an intergenera-
> tional commitment. Urbanization, invasive species, and water pollution undermine native vegetation and key cultural species such as
> native salmon. Today, this watershed initiative gathers community organizations, municipalities, and institutional agencies to imple-
> ment a long-term effort to restore native vegetation and wildlife, and provide a community greenway to connect neighborhoods (see
> BCI 2021). In southern India's Bengaluru City, urban lakes have been undermined by housing development, dumping and waste, and
> neglect by governmental agencies (Murphy et al. 2021). Local groups who live around lakes have led restoration efforts (green cleaning
> areas) to generate reciprocal contributions for them (e.g., healthy sites and fishing in periurban lakes) and for the local environment
> (e.g., enhancing bird habitats; see Murphy et al. 2021). In Punta Arenas City (Patagonia, Chile), for 14 years, urban organizations
> restore and defend the Tres Puentes wetland (see figure 4), which is surrounded by industrial buildings and neighborhoods. It was a
> large wetland in the past, but because of urbanization, the wetland is now a small area, with 50 hectares hosting 91 bird species (Gómez
> et al. 2014). For many years, governmental agencies have wanted to build an elevated highway over the wetland. Urban organizations
> continue restoring while wetland biodiversity generates educational and touristic activities (figure 4; Cárcamo et al. 2012). These urban

> The rights of nature, depicted in ­ figure 1 as part of the
> institutional–social–political dimension, can also be seen as

> covenant between people and nature. The rights of nature
> stipulate that nature is a subject with rights and that humans
> are responsible for complying with these rights (Millaleo
> 2019). For example, in South America, Ecuador and Bolivia
> have started advocating for the rights of nature and have
> enshrined the concept into their constitutions (Guardiola
> and Gracía-Quero 2014). Chile is now in the middle of a
> new constitutional process, and nature–people reciprocity

> a Mapuche scholar, advocates that a new moral covenant in
> Chile must encompass obligations of reciprocity with nature
> and emphasizes that a new constitution should include the
> kinship notion between people and Mother Earth (Millaleo
> 2021). This highlights that reciprocal contributions can trig-

> Cross-cutting reciprocal contributions. Although the categoriza-

> For example, for sea gardens and corrales de pesca (biophysi-

> munity-based management (institutional–social–political
> dimension). Coastal First Nations in Canada consider clams

> and the NCP framework. Psychological researchers and
> human geographers have emphasized how a sense of place
> can inform reciprocal actions in the human society (see
> Raymond et al. 2021). This approach depicts people's con-
> nection to places, encompassing attachments that people
> feel for a place embedded in meanings (Murphy et al. 2021).
> These meanings describe people's symbolic relations to a
> place (Raymond et al. 2021). Traditionally, a strong attach-
> ment leads to groups of people willing to advocate for nature
> in their home place, although there are multiple motivations
> for this advocacy (Masterson et al. 2017).
> Investigating the sense of place, using quantitative (struc-
> tured surveys) or qualitative (narrative interviews) tools, can
> reveal reciprocal contributions (see Raymond et al. 2021).
> For instance, in box 3, we show that local groups, who live
> around lakes in Bengaluru City, have led restoration efforts
> to generate reciprocal contributions for human well-being,
> agriculture, and migratory waterbirds. Murphy and col-
> leagues (2021) used the sense of place as a methodological
> approach to understand that restoration efforts can have
> several motivations. For example, the remediation of pollu-
> tion was an important goal for some citizens, and the col-
> lective memories of the healthy lake system in the past were
> also important motivations for old neighbors. In the 2000s,
> public protests started because people did not have access to
> restore and maintain lakes, and in the 2010s, the residents
> and the municipality started an agreement for comanage-
> ment (Murphy et al. 2021). The sense of place offers myriad
> ways of understanding nature–people reciprocity by identi-
> fying changes, differences, and consensus of multiple groups
> who inhabit social–ecological environments.
> The NCP framework can also inform nature–people
> reciprocity. An outstanding case of this framework is the
> IPBES Pollination Assessment, which has local to global
> contributions (Díaz et al. 2018, Hill et al. 2021). Due to the
> global relevance of NCP, we believe this inclusive framework
> should have a permeable capacity for feedback, including
> other voices beyond the IPBES groups. For example, Hill
> and colleagues (2021) briefly mentioned that interwoven

> with multiple dimensions and levels together to emphasize
> the role of the temporal scale for assessments.
> In specific terms, the categorization of reciprocal contribu-
