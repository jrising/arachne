**user**:
> Dear Dr. JAMES RISING,
> Please allow me the great honor to introduce myself. I am Lingze Meng, a Chinese graduate in the final year of a 3-year master degree program in Marine Chemistry at the College of Ocean and Earth Sciences at Xiamen University.
> 
> I am confident in applying for the doctoral programme in Marine Policy at SCHOOL OF MARINE SCIENCE & POLICY at The College of Earth, Ocean and Environment (CEOE) at The University of Delaware. I am keenly interested in the area and seek to leverage my experience within this field, and I have the utmost respect for your prominent academic achievements and extraordinary contributions. My CV and transcripts of both undergraduate and graduate modules are attached to the application for your kind consideration.
> 
> Being a dedicated and diligent young man, I have a natural science background, relevant research experience in shipping emissions modeling and environmental impact monetizing, and skills of chemistry lab, programming (MATLAB, Python), and mathematic modeling. I believe I can make due contributions to the doctoral program and I look forward to becoming part of your world-renowned team to participate in the PhD research.
> 
> I would love to know if there is a PhD candidate position under your supervision starting from Sep. 2014 and if any funding is available. Thank you for your kind consideration and for your precious time.
> 
> I appreciate an opportunity to exchange thoughts and answer any questions you may ask to better present myself. Please contact me via E-mail or phone call if needed. I look forward to your kind response.

**assistant**:
> Dear Lingze Meng,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. From your letter and background, it seems like a good fit would be the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics. This program emphasizes interdisciplinary models and applying quantitative skills, which aligns with your experience in shipping emissions modeling and environmental impact monetizing.
> 
> Keep in mind that funding for Ph.D. students can be limited. Given your interest in environmental impact and your skills in programming and mathematical modeling, you may want to mention my work on climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling in your statement of purpose. This could strengthen your application and align you with potential funding options.
> 
> I encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year to have your application considered for any available funds. 
> 
> Looking forward to your application.
> 
> Best,
> James Rising

**user**:
> The student is asking about the Marine Policy PhD, which seems like a better fit. Can you adjust?
**assistant**:
> My apologies for the oversight. Thank you for bringing that to my attention, and I appreciate your patience.
> 
> Based on your strong background in marine chemistry and your interest in marine policy, the Ph.D. program in Marine Policy at the School of Marine Science & Policy at the University of Delaware could indeed be an excellent fit for you. This program focuses on the interdisciplinary study of marine policy and governance, addressing various environmental and sustainability challenges in the marine realm.
> 
> To inquire about the availability of a Ph.D. candidate position under Dr. James Rising's supervision and the potential for funding, it would be best to directly contact the School of Marine Science & Policy at the University of Delaware. They will provide you with the most up-to-date information regarding positions and funding opportunities.
> 
> In your communication with the program, highlight your research experience in marine chemistry, your skills in programming and mathematical modeling, as well as your passion for marine policy and governance. Emphasize how your background and interests align with the program's objectives and emphasize any relevant achievements or projects you have been involved in.
> 
> I wish you all the best with your application and academic pursuits. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.
