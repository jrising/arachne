> I am setting up a server in my office, and I want to make sure that I can SSH into it remotely, but also have a level of security. Can I configure UFW to allow SSH connections as long as I am connected to my VPN?
**assistant**:
> Yes, configuring UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow SSH connections while connected to a VPN is definitely possible. The way to achieve this involves allowing SSH connections only from the VPN's IP address range. Here are step-by-step instructions:
> 
> 1. **Determine the IP Address Range of Your VPN**: You need to know the IP range that your VPN uses. You can look for this information in the VPN's settings or documentation. If you have a private VPN server, the IP address range will likely be a private IP address range.
> 
> 2. **Enable UFW If It's Not Already**: Before changing any settings, always ensure that UFW is enabled. You can do this by typing the following command in your terminal:
>    ```
>      sudo ufw enable
>    ```
> 3. **Default UFW to Deny All Inbound Connections**: You will want to set your UFW to deny all incoming connections by default. You can do this with the following command:
>    ```
>      sudo ufw default deny incoming
>    ```
> 4. **Allow Incoming SSH Connections Only from VPN**: Assuming the VPN's IP range is `192.168.0.0/16` (please replace this example with your actual VPN's IP range), you can allow SSH (port 22) connections with:
>    ```
>      sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 22
>    ```
> 5. **Enable UFW**: The final step is to enable UFW with your new rules:
>    ```
>      sudo ufw enable
>    ```
> 6. **Check Your UFW Configuration**: To be safe, double-check your configuration with the following command:
>    ```
>      sudo ufw status verbose
>    ```
> The `status verbose` command will describe the current rules set for the UFW.
> 
> With these rules, unless the SSH connection is coming from the VPN's IP address range, it will be automatically blocked. In other words, you can only SSH into your server if you are connected to your VPN. The process provides a significant layer of security for your server.
> 
> *Please remember that running a server accessible over the internet, even with SSH and VPN connections, carries inherent security risks, so ensure you maintain good security practices.*
> 
> I should note, however, that enabling access solely from your VPN might be an overkill depending on your requirements, and it might cause you inconvenience should you need SSH access from a different network. An alternative approach is to harden your SSH instead (e.g., disallowing root login, using key pairs instead of passwords, using fail2ban, etc.).
> 
> Also, keep in mind to appropriately configured your VPN to ensure security, since weakly configured VPN can also be a source of security issues. If you'd like, I can provide guidelines on VPN and SSH hardening too.
