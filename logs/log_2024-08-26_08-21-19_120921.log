**assistant**:
> Sure, I can help develop a basic concept for a regional fundraising plan that pairs the locations where the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) has hubs or does work with your funders in those locations. You wish to set up Centers of Excellence that would be a part of this initiative, aiding in both national organization and local ecosystem building.
> 
> Here's an initial outline:
> 
> 1. **Goal Definition**: First, clearly define your goals. You've mentioned place-based goals such as securing Global Greenhouse Gas Reduction (GGRF) bridge funding and enhancing Building Performance Policy (BPP), alongside long-term goals of building local ecosystems and strengthening national presence.
> 
> 2. **Funder Identification**:
> 
>     a. Identify your current funders, their geographical locations, and their specific interest areas. Would their interests align with the goals of your proposed Centers of Excellence?
>     
>     b. Create a potential-funders map that includes other organizations or individuals in areas where IMT has branches or conducts work, and who align with your mission.
> 
> 3. **Creating Cohorts**: Establish your Centers of Excellence as cohorts in each of the identified areas.
> 
>     a. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Ensure each cohort has regular touchpoints with the program team. These could be bi-annual calls or meetings, opportunities to witness work firsthand, etc.
> 
>     b. **Positive Visibility**: Prominently feature cohort members on your website and in newsletters, demonstrating their contributions and strengthening their connection to IMT and its mission.
> 
> 4. **Partnership Development**: Foster relationships with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) to provide support. Advocate for these CBOs, strengthen their relationships with funders, and potentially tap into new sources of funding through them.
> 
> 5. **Building Local Ecosystems**: Employ your Centers of Excellence to develop strong, local ecosystems. By having a physical presence and a committed group of funders and partners in different areas, you can help foster local climate action initiatives and create a blueprint for other regions to follow.
> 
> 6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Keep track of each Center of Excellence's progress towards its goals. Regularly evaluate what's working, what isn't, and be prepared to make changes as necessary. 
> 
> This is a basic structure but developing a detailed plan would require more specific information about your current funder landscape, planned activities, and locations under consideration. You may want to engage in additional strategic planning sessions or workshops to refine this basic outline into a complete regional fundraising plan.
