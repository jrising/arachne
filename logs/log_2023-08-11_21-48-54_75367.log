> I previously asked for some information extracted from a document:
> Activity Name: Shipping traffic
> 
> Description: This relates to the movement of commercial vessels in primarily designated areas known as Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs). The TSSs ensure orderly traffic, minimizing accidents. Shipping traffic can create conflict with offshore wind projects.
> Current Status: Regular, ongoing activity that is subject to strict international and national rules.
> Spatial extent: Primarily within designated TSSs in the mid-Atlantic and at the mouth of the Delaware Bay. Some traffic goes beyond these lines, particularly near coasts.
> Temporal Pattern: Data analyzed from December and July 2009 indicate seasonality in the shipping traffic patterns.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: The buffer zones around TSSs may be increased to avoid accidents, and anchorage areas may be officially designated.
> Stakeholders: BOEM, USCG, shipping companies, wind energy developers, port authorities, International Maritime Organization.
> Sources: BOEM, IMO, SOLAS, NOAA, Coastal Services Center, Marine Spatial Planning reports.
> Any other notes: The Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides detailed data on vessel traffic which can be used to aid in spatial planning and ensure safe navigation.
> Activity Name: Offshore Wind Energy Development
> 
> Description: The development and operation of wind energy installations in offshore areas. Wind projects could overlap with and disrupt other marine activities.
> Current Status: Proposed and undergoing planning and project development.
> Spatial extent: BOEM-designated wind energy lease blocks (WEAs) within the mid-Atlantic region.
> Temporal Pattern: Not explicitly mentioned in the text.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: More sites may be proposed and developed, with siting affected by marine spatial planning to avoid conflicts with other uses (e.g., shipping).
> Stakeholders: Wind energy developers, BOEM, USCG, shipping industry, local communities, and environmental organizations.
> Sources: BOEM, USCG, Marine Spatial Planning reports.
> Any other notes: Spatial planning, using tools like AIS Data Handler, can assist with determining appropriate wind development sites to minimize conflicts with shipping.
> Activity Name: Anchorage
> 
> Description: Areas adjacent to TSS shipping lanes used as anchorage grounds for ships waiting to enter or exit the Delaware Bay and River.
> Current Status: Unofficially active; USCG considering official designation.
> Spatial Extent: Specific area adjacent to the southeast TSS approach, the charted ordnance dumping ground, and the 12 nm territorial sea line.
> Temporal Pattern: Not explicitly stated in the text, but assumed to be continuous as long as shipping activity continues.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Could become an official anchorage ground, excluding activities like cable-laying.
> Stakeholders: Shipping companies, port authorities, USCG, BOEM, potentially excluded activities such as cable-laying operations.
> Sources: BOEM, USCG, Marine Spatial Planning reports.
> Any other notes: Not specifically mentioned, but designation of this area as an anchorage ground could impact other plans regarding ocean usage, like wind energy projects.

> Can you organize this into a table with all of the fields, with a row for each activity?
