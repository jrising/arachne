> Estimating Current Climate Losses - Project Proposal
> PI: James Rising, University of Delaware
> 
> Context: The planet has already warmed by 1.34 Â°C [1.2 - 1.5 Â°C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. Under one expert review of global damages, this suggests that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion. In poor, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be significantly greater.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> Deliverable: This project will develop best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome will be percent reductions in GDP per capita and percent reductions in capital wealth, in 2023, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP per capita is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels. A recent estimate of GDP losses, combining three of these results and produced by the PI for a previous ECF-funded project on the cost of climate change in the UK, is shown below.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses will provide new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change. The losses would also be reported as a global average and for various regional and country groups (e.g., LLMICs, G77, Sub-Saharan Africa).
> 
> Annually varying loss estimates will underlie these results, which will reflect greater losses in years with heat waves and in later years as climate change accelerates. We will develop short case studies from the EU and LLMICs will compare these GDP losses to other reported impacts of recent heat waves.
> 
> The estimates will be produced as part of a short report made initially available to the sponsors Nov. 1, 2023, and for release during COP 28. The work will then be prepared for academic publication.
> 
> Unique contribution: To produce these results, we bring together existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate (see Table under Points of Methodology). Over the past decade, this literature has proposed many different approaches to understanding the effect of climate on GDP, including investigations of the differential vulnerability of poor countries, the role of persistent losses to growth, and the potential of adaptation. Current attempts to synthesise this literature are limited to simply averaging the results. Using a machine learning model, calibrated to the results from this literature, we will produce an estimate that reflects the most advanced features of all of these papers.
> 
> The PI has developed a system for generating projections from this class of models for the UK climate impacts project. The machine learning approach is based on another of the PIâ€™s projects, producing a best-estimate of the social cost of carbon.

> The table shows an assessment of the quality of each modelâ€™s representation of temperature variables (Temp.), rainfall (Prec.), additional controls (Addâ€™l), unobserved heterogeneity (FE), and underlying data (Data). No single existing estimate captures the full range of relevant factors that has been identified in the literature.
> 
> We will use ERA5 reanalysis weather data to produce historical projections of climate effects, available 1940 - present. To construct the counterfactual without climate change, we will resample values from the baseline period (1940 - 1960). A key question in the literature is the extent to which impacts put countries on a permanently lower growth trajectory. This was carefully analysed in a previous paper of the PIâ€™s, and the resulting uncertain distribution of persistence will be used here.
> 
> Drawing upon both the headline estimates and additional results in the paper will provide evidence across the space of possible combinations of model elements. A random forest model will then be fit to these models, informed by meta-data about each. Finally, the random forest will be queried for damages from a model that simultaneously represents high-quality features in all model categories.
> 
> As an additional line of evidence, we will use the previously mentioned Howard & Sterner meta-analysis of damage results derived from expert elicitation. This provides both a measure of catastrophic risk, which will be applied uniformly across the globe, and an estimate of non-catastrophic global losses, which can be used as a loose constraint on the sum of the machine learning results.

The difference between these is then the ImmediateImpact_it for each country i in year t.

> This section describes how we estimated current macroeconomic losses due to climate change using a machine learning model to synthesize findings from existing research and assessing its performance against historical growth and weather data.
> 
> \subsection*{A.1: Data and Uncertainty Representations}
> 
> We used the ERA5 reanalysis weather data from 1940 until 2022. This dataset provides consistent estimates of meteorological variables over this period. 
> 
> Uncertainty in the study is represented using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations are designed to account for parametric uncertainty within the models.
> 
> \subsection*{A.2: Immediate Impact Estimation}
> 
> For each simulation, we draw from the uncertainty distribution of the model parameters. We then simulate each model for each country under observed weather conditions (accounting only for temperature-based variables) and a counterfactual climate history. The counterfactual climate is generated by resampling values from the baseline period (1940-1959). The difference between the reality and counterfactual represents the immediate weather-based impact ($ImmediateImpact_{it}$) on each country $i$ in year $t$.
> 
> \subsection*{A.3: Accounting for Growth Trajectories}
> 
> The impacts accumulate across years within each country. For each country and year, we define the direct impact ($DirectImpact_{it}$) as the sum of the decayed immediate impacts over the years. This is represented by the equation:
> 
> $$DirectImpact_{it} = \sum_{s \le t} (1 - \phi)^{t - s} * ImmediateImpact_{is}.$$
> 
> In this equation, $\phi$ is the persistence parameter of the model, following Nath, Klenow and Ramey, representing the extent to which impacts put countries on a permanently lower growth trajectory. $\phi = 0.25$, implying that each year's impact decays at a rate of 25\% per year. 
> 
> For models such as those suggested by Kotz et al. that already account for impact accumulation over years, we do not apply this procedure.
> 
> \subsection*{A.4: Synthesizing Model Results}
> 
> We fit a random forest model to the results of the individual climate-economic models. This model is informed by meta-data about each climate-economic model, such as how well they account for temperature and precipitation variables, additional controls, unobserved heterogeneity, and the quality of underlying data. 
> 
> We query the random forest for damages from a hypothetical model that simultaneously represents high-quality features in all model categories. The global and country-specific projections generated from these models can be referred to in Figure \#METHPROJ.
