**user**:
> What are terms for the walk that a monster might have as a stomps forward toward you?
**assistant**:
> A monster's walk tends to be vividly described for its menacing qualities. Here are a few terms or phrases that could apply:
> 
> 1. **Lumbering**: This term emphasizes the heavy, slow, and clumsy movement of the monster.
> 
> 2. **Stamping**: This implies the heavy footfalls of the monster – each step making a notable impression.
> 
> 3. **Lurching**: This portrays an uneven, staggering walk, often used to describe zombies or similarly afflicted creatures.
> 
> 4. **Trudging**: This indicates movement with effort, emphasizing the size and weight of the monster.
> 
> 5. **Stalking**: This term depicts the predatory nature of the monster – each step calculated to incite fear.
> 
> 6. **Shuffling**: Often used for undead or slow-moving monstrous creatures, it emphasizes their relentless, if slow, approach.
> 
> 7. **Prowling**: This term suggests a more cautious or stealthy advance, like a big cat hunting its prey.
> 
> 8. **Thunderous Stride**: Conveys the intense, heavy footfalls of the monster creating noise like a thunderclap.
> 
> 9. **Slinking**: This term might be used for a more serpent-like or deceptive creature, moving smoothly and sneakily.
> 
> 10. **Plodding**: This portrays a heavy, slow, and laborious walk, much like trudging.
> 
> Remember to incorporate the overall physicality, intent, and atmosphere of the scene when selecting your term.
