**user**:
> I have the following relationship:
> p = (1 - (1 - A)^X)
> Is there a way to approximate this under the assumption that A << 1?
**assistant**:
> When A << 1, we can use the approximation (1 - A)^X ≈ 1 - XA, which is derived from the first two terms of the binomial expansion. This approximation is valid when A is much smaller than 1 and when XA is also small.

> p ≈ 1 - (1 - XA) 
>   = XA

> Therefore, p is approximately equal to XA under the assumption that A is much less than 1 and XA is also small.
