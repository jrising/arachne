**assistant**:
> A classic example of a self-enforcing contract designed using contract theory is the creation of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) contracts. These contracts are amongst multiple players in a community and are designed to manage and protect common resources such as water, forests, and wildlife that are public goods.
> 
> Here's how this contract works:
> 
> 1. **Players**: The players in this contract are the members of the community or user group who share access to and responsibility for the natural resource.
> 
> 2. **Contract Agreement**: The agreement often involves commitments to sustainable usage, protection, and management of the common resource. The users agree on rules for usage (e.g., harvest limitations, rotational use, etc.) to ensure the resource's long-term survival and availability.
> 
> 3. **Incentives**: The contract provides incentives typically in two forms: access to the resource and reputation within the community. Users who comply with the agreed rules maintain their rights to the resource and their standing in the community, while those who violate face potential loss of access and social sanction.
> 
> 4. **Enforcement**: Enforcement is via peer monitoring and social sanction, making the contract essentially self-enforcing. Since all users share an interest in the sustainability of the resource, they also share interest in ensuring everyone abides by the contract.
> 
> 5. **Outcome**: The intended result is the sustained availability of the common resource, benefiting all users economically and/or in terms of survival, and often providing ecological benefits as well.

> This type of contract has been employed in many places worldwide to manage fisheries, groundwater, forests, and pastures. It's important to note that efficacy varies based on cultural, institutional, and environmental factors. Specifically, the functionality and durability of such contracts depend highly on the strength of the community, its shared values, and the overall context in which it operates.
