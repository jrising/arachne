> How can I organize these sensibly?
**assistant**:
> You can organize these functional groups by categorizing them based on size and then functional type. This will enhance clarity and make the data more readable. Here's a breakdown of how you might structure them:
> 
> ### Large (>=90 cm)
> - Bathydemersals
> - Bathypelagics
> - Benthopelagics
> - Demersals
> - Flatfishes
> - Pelagics
> - Rays
> - Reef associated fish
> - Sharks
> 
> ### Medium (30 - 89 cm)
> - Bathydemersals
> - Bathypelagics
> - Benthopelagics
> - Demersals
> - Pelagics
> - Reef associated fish
> 
> ### Small (<30 cm)
> - Bathydemersals
> - Bathypelagics
> - Benthopelagics
> - Demersals
> - Pelagics
> - Reef associated fish
> 
> ### Small to Medium (<90 cm)
> - Flatfishes
> - Rays
> - Sharks
> 
> This classification separates the groups primarily by size and then by their ecological niche or habitat association. You could further organize them hierarchically in a data structure, such as a nested dictionary, or as an outline in your documentation for clarity. If coding, this could be turned into a dictionary or a DataFrame to facilitate processing.
