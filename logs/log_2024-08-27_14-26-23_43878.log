**assistant**:
> It seems like you are encountering a package compatibility issue where users are getting errors related to the `DataFrames` version, despite not seeing explicit restrictions in your `Project.toml`. This can happen due to indirect dependencies and compatibility constraints of the packages you depend on. Here are a few steps to help investigate and potentially resolve this issue:
> 
> 1. **Check the Compatibility of Dependencies:**
>    While you haven't explicitly restricted `DataFrames` in your `compat` section, the other packages you depend on might have restrictions that affect the `DataFrames` package. Run `Pkg.status()` in Julia to see the versions of the dependencies being used, and check their compatibility constraints (especially the `DataFrames` compatibility) in their respective repositories. You can also check if those repositories have issues or pull requests related to compatibility.
> 
> 2. **Update Packages:**
>    Make sure you and your users have updated packages to their latest versions. You can do this by running:
>    ```julia
>    using Pkg
>    Pkg.update()
>    ```
>    Then, confirm that you're using the most recent and compatible versions.
> 
> 3. **Resolve Dependency Versions:**
>    Use the Pkg.jl package resolver to figure out which combinations of versions are compatible. You can try cleaning your project environment and re-adding your package to see if you can reproduce the issue, using:
>    ```julia
>    using Pkg
>    Pkg.activate("path/to/your/package")
>    Pkg.resolve()
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Review the `Project.toml` and Indirect Constraints:**
>    Your `Project.toml` may not list an explicit constraint on `DataFrames`, but indirect dependencies (dependencies of the packages you depend on) may introduce constraints. Investigate those packages to see their `[compat]` sections and if any of them are constraining the `DataFrames` version.
> 
> 5. **Add Explicit Compatibility:**
>    If you determine that none of the above steps resolve the issue, and you've identified a compatible version range of `DataFrames` that works with your package and its dependencies, you might want to add explicit compatibility constraints for `DataFrames` in your `[compat]` section:
>    ```toml
>    [compat]
>    DataFrames = "≥ 0.21, < 1.0"  # Example version constraints
>    ```
>    Ensure that these constraints accurately reflect the tested and working versions.
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the dependency conflict, ensuring your package remains compatible with `DataFrames` and other packages your users may rely on. If the problem persists despite these efforts, consider reaching out to the Julia community for more specific insights regarding your package's dependencies.
