**assistant**:
> The election of 1896 in America was notable for its intense focus on the issue of monetary policy, specifically the debate over bimetallism versus the gold standard. This debate revolved around whether the U.S. currency should be backed by both gold and silver (bimetallism) or exclusively by gold.
> 
> **Key points of the debate:**
> 
> 1. **Bimetallism**: Advocates, including Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan, argued that allowing silver to be used as currency alongside gold would inflate the money supply, relieve debtors, and spur economic growth. This was particularly appealing to farmers and working-class citizens who were suffering from deflation and economic depression.
> 
> 2. **Gold Standard**: Supporters, including Republican candidate William McKinley, contended that currency should be backed solely by gold to ensure stability and prevent inflation. This position was favored by business interests and urban populations who feared that bimetallism would devalue money and harm the economy.
> 
> 3. **William Jennings Bryan's "Cross of Gold" Speech**: One of the most famous moments in American political history, Bryan delivered a passionate speech at the Democratic National Convention, arguing against the gold standard and for bimetallism. His closing line, "You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold," became emblematic of the bimetallism cause.
> 
> The debate was substantive and technical, involving economic theories and the impacts on different socio-economic groups. It significantly raised public awareness and educated many Americans on issues related to economic policy and monetary systems.
> 
> Ultimately, McKinley won the election, and the U.S. remained on the gold standard until the eventual adoption of fiat currency in the 20th century. But the 1896 election remains a key example of a complex policy debate that captured national attention and deeply engaged the electorate.
