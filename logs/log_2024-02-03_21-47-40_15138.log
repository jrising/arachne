**user**:
> What is returned by the `.each` command applied to a list of DOM elements, the function would return a promise?
**assistant**:
> In jQuery, the `.each` method is used to loop through a set of matched elements and perform an operation on each one. This method does not directly support the use of Promises or asynchronous operations within its logic, as it's designed for synchronous execution.
> 
> However, if you want to apply a function involving Promises to `each` element in a list and retrieve an array of the resolved promises, you can use the native JavaScript `Array.prototype.map` function in conjunction with `Promise.all`.
> 
> As an example:
> 
> ```javascript
> var elements = $('.someClass'); // get your DOM elements
> 
> var promiseArray = Array.from(elements).map(function(element) {
>     // Return a new Promise based on element here
>     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
>         // Do something asynchronous here with your element
>         // Resolve or reject based on the outcome
>     });
> });
> 
> Promise.all(promiseArray)
>     .then(results => {
>         // All of your resolved promises are in results
>         console.log(results);
>     })
>     .catch(error => {
>         // catch any error if any of the Promises were rejected
>         console.log('Error: ', error);
>     });
>   ```
> 
> This code will result in an array of Promises (`promiseArray`) which you can use with `Promise.all` to ensure all Promises have resolved before handling their results as an array (`results`).
>   
> Please note, this will only work if `$('.someClass')` returns multiple elements. If only one element is returned, you would treat it as a single Promise, not an array of Promises. 
> 
> Also, remember that `Promise.all` fails fast - if any promise is rejected, it immediately aborts with a rejection, not waiting for the other promises to resolve. If you need to have all promises resolve regardless of some failing, look into `Promise.allSettled`.
