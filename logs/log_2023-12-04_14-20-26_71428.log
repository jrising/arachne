> Benefit–Cost Analysis
> thus far, we have discussed efficiency as a “best” or “maximal” outcome— for example, a particular level of pollution control that maximizes net benefits.the concept of efficiency is also useful in comparing alternatives, neither of which necessarily maximizes net benefits relative to all other possible policies.the basic principle is straightforward: Policy a is more efficient than policy B if the net benefits are greater under policy a. For example, Congress may consider whether to require electric power plants to install pollution control devices to reduce mercury emissions into the atmosphere, comparing a proposed regulation with the status quo. a re- gional development agency may decide whether to spend transportation funds on highway expansion or on construction of a light-rail network. in cases such as these, a systematic comparison of benefits and costs can be a useful aid to government policy.
> in the United states, the major environmental statutes differ in their relative emphasis on benefit–cost analysis as a policymaking tool.as econ- omist and former ePa official richard Morgenstern has noted, the stat- utes alternately “forbid, inhibit, tolerate, allow, invite, or require the use of economic analysis in decisionmaking.”18 since 1996, the safe drinking Water act has contained the most significant requirement for benefit–cost analysis of any environmental statute; it is required for all new maximum contaminant level (MCL) standards, and revisions to any existing MCLs, for treated drinking water.at the other end of the spectrum, the Clean air act forbids the consideration of cost in setting the national ambient air quality standards that govern local and regional air pollutants. But some of the most significant benefit–cost analyses that have been performed for U.s. environmental policy have focused on Clean air act regulations; we discuss some of them in this chapter and others later in the book. if the Clean air act forbids consideration of costs in standard setting, why has the ePa performed these economic analyses? the answer is that benefit–cost analysis of all environmental, health, and safety regulations expected to have significant costs to the U.s. economy has been required by executive orders signed by every U.s. president (from both political
>  What Is the Value of Global Ecosystem Services? A Cautionary Tale
> In a well-known article published in Nature magazine, Robert Costanza and a group of colleagues set about estimating the total worldwide value of re- newable ecosystem services.19 They focused on seventeen types of ecosystem services, including pollination, nutrient cycling, and regulation of the composi- tion of gases in the atmosphere, as well as more mundane goods and services produced by nature, such as food production, raw materials (e.g., timber), and recreational opportunities. Their goal was to demonstrate the economic sig- nificance of such natural capital, most of which is not traded in the economy.
> Their conclusion? The study estimated the annual value of such ecosystem services worldwide to be $33 trillion. That might sound like a lot of money. Af- ter all, as the authors point out, it is just shy of twice the global gross national product at the time of the study. On reflection, however, this amount starts to look fairly small. After all, the world economy grew at about 2 percent per year in 1995. At that rate, the world economy would surpass the value of ecosystem services by the year 2025 or so. The elimination of major global ecosystem services would obviously have devastating effects on human welfare. Indeed, as one analyst quipped, $33 trillion is “a serious underestimate of infinity.”20 Where did the analysis go wrong?
> An important part of the answer is that they use estimates of marginal will- ingness to pay in computing the total values of ecosystem services. Of course, these concepts are closely related, as we saw in Chapter 2. But we also saw that marginal willingness to pay often depends on the level of environmental quality. For example, to answer the question “What is the value of pollination services?” Costanza and his colleagues figured out the value of pollination for the marginal hectare and then multiplied it by the total land area that is pol- linated. This is akin to the difference between asking “What is the value of a particular bee colony?” and asking “What is the value of all of the bees in the world?” We can’t answer the latter question by scaling up the value of a single beehive. As beehives became scarcer, they would become more valuable.
> A related point is that the complete elimination of vital ecosystem services would affect society in fundamental and interconnected ways. When econo- mists measure marginal benefits, they evaluate small changes. The loss of all wild pollinators worldwide—or even more dramatically the shutdown of pro- cesses that regulate Earth’s atmosphere—would cause drastic shifts in the demand and supply of all kinds of goods and services (including the very ame- nities and services being measured).
> Does this mean that the benefit techniques we have discussed are not use- ful? On the contrary, they are eminently suited to assessing the effect of spe- cific policies, such as reducing concentrations of air pollution or setting aside a wilderness area for habitat protection. They are simply inadequate measures of the value of global ecosystem services in their entirety.

> parties) since richard nixon. since the reagan administration, the level of expected cost that has triggered this requirement (for what has become known as regulatory impact analysis) is $100 million per year. neither the benefit–cost analysis requirement under the safe drinking Water act nor the executive order requirement covering all environmental policy involves strict benefit–cost tests. that is, ePa and other agencies may still propose and enact rules for which the monetized costs exceed the monetized benefits.an important and controversial example of this was a revision to the rule governing allowable concentrations of arsenic in U.s. drinking water, proposed by ePa in 2000 and enforced beginning in 2006. nonetheless, the benefit–cost analyses of U.s. environmental regulations produced because of these requirements have provided very important information to the environmental policy process.21
> Critiques of Benefit–Cost Analysis
> although it is simple to describe, benefit–cost analysis has attracted con- siderable controversy, especially in the environmental arena. Critics of benefit–cost analysis typically advance four main arguments against it.22 First, basing decisions simply on whether benefits outweigh costs omits important political and moral considerations, such as fundamental rights or duties. second, discounting benefits that will occur in the distant fu- ture privileges current generations at the expense of future ones.third, goods such as clean air or clean water are devalued and cheapened when their worth is expressed in monetary terms. Finally, focusing on the net benefits to society as a whole ignores the identities of the winners and the losers—that is, an emphasis on efficiency obscures a consideration of distributional equity.We consider each of these criticisms in turn. doing so allows us to probe more deeply the usefulness of economic efficiency and the limitations of economic analysis.
> “Benefit–Cost Analysis Should Not Be the Only Criterion for Decision Making”
> Critics of benefit–cost analysis often contend that economic theory pre- scribes the use of benefit–cost analysis to the exclusion of other consid- erations.the emphasis that economists place on the concept of efficiency may initially leave the mistaken impression that they view net benefits as the only criterion needed for public policy. in fact, most economists reject such a narrow view.the consensus among economists is that benefit–cost analysis should be viewed as a means of improving the information avail- able to decision makers, not as the sole guide to decision making. in the

>  Benefit–Cost Analysis in the Real World: EPA’s Study of Lead in Gasoline
> In the fall of 1983, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency initiated an in- ternal study into the benefits and costs of reducing lead in gasoline.23 The use of lead as a fuel additive to increase octane levels had been restricted since the early 1970s, but high levels of lead persisted in the environment in the early 1980s, partly because older leaded-fueled cars remained on the road and partly because some owners of newer cars “misfueled” their cars by using leaded gasoline.
> The agency’s Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), published in 1985, identi- fied four main benefits of phasing out lead. Two were linked to reductions in the main adverse human health effects from lead: damages to cognitive and physiological development in children and exacerbation of high blood pres- sure in men. A third benefit was a reduction in emissions of other pollutants from cars, because burning leaded gasoline destroyed the effectiveness of cat- alytic converters. The final benefit was lower costs of engine maintenance and related increases in fuel economy. Meanwhile, the primary costs of phasing out leaded gasoline were the costs of installing new equipment at refineries and producing alternative additives to boost octane levels.
> The study found that the benefits of reducing lead would substantially out- weigh the costs. For a tenfold reduction in lead content (from 1.1 to 0.1 grams per gallon of gasoline), the net benefits were a little over $7 billion dollars an- nually (in 1983 dollars): $7.8 billion in benefits minus $600 million in increased refining costs. These findings helped support the EPA’s decision to accelerate the required removal of lead from gasoline. That reversed the trend set a few years earlier, when the agency, citing costs to refineries, had settled on a much weaker rule than preferred by environmental and public health advocates.
> That the benefit–cost analysis succeeded in bolstering the case for tighter regulations was all the more notable because of the gaps in the analysis, gaps readily acknowledged by the study’s authors. EPA staff were able to include only the avoided costs of medical care and remedial education for children with blood lead levels above a certain threshold, leaving out the lion’s share of bene- fits, such as the willingness to pay to avoid lasting health and cognitive impacts.
> The leaded gasoline example illustrates the usefulness of computing ben- efits in dollar terms to make them commensurable with other benefits and with costs. Indeed, the case for removing lead from gasoline would have been even stronger had the analysts been able to estimate the dollar value of improving children’s health and cognitive abilities. Quantifying benefits (as well as costs) can focus regulatory efforts on the areas likely to yield the greatest net ben- efits to society. As one of the study’s authors has pointed out, there was little political pressure on EPA at the time to tighten lead standards. Indeed, much more attention was being devoted to issues such as hazardous air pollutants and uranium mill tailings, even though the damages from such problems (and thus the benefits from cleanup) were orders of magnitude smaller than those at stake with leaded gasoline.

> “Discounting Is Unfair to Future Generations”
> a second criticism concerns the use of discounting to compare costs and benefits over time. it may seem grossly unfair to weigh costs to people living today more heavily than benefits to future generations. indeed, economists recognize full well the thorny issues of intergenerational eq- uity raised by discounting.William nordhaus has illustrated the dilemma with a particularly striking example. suppose we discover that Florida will be entirely destroyed 200 years from now by an asteroid impact. suppose that we could prevent this catastrophe by launching a missile today to intercept the asteroid. how much should we be willing to pay for the missile? Using the value of land and capital in Florida and the 7 percent discount rate mandated by the U.s. office of Management and Budget for use in government benefit–cost analyses, nordhaus calcu- lates that preventing Florida’s annihilation two centuries hence would be worth only about $3 million. if launching the missile cost more than that, a strict benefit–cost test (using the government discount rate) would advise against its launch.25
> this thought experiment highlights the importance of the choice of discount rate. after all, if nordhaus applied a 2 percent discount rate— putting more weight on the future—the present value of preventing the destruction of Florida would be around $43 billion—still small, perhaps, but several orders of magnitude more than $3 million.
> at a deeper level, however, this thought experiment illustrates the limitations of using efficiency as the only criterion for decision making. sometimes, benefit–cost analysis may suggest a course of action that we might still choose to reject on the basis of ethical considerations—for example, concerns about intergenerational equity. But that does not mean that we should not do the analysis in the first place. in making decisions about how to trade off current costs and future benefits, we as a society are surely better off when we have more information about the choices we face. Carrying out a benefit–cost analysis does not commit us to any

> ment echoes the one made by the blue-ribbon panel cited earlier.
> “Putting Benefits in DollarTerms Cheapens theWorth of the Environment”
> a third common criticism of benefit–cost analysis is that it relies on mon- etary measures of the benefits of environmental amenities such as clean air or endangered species preservation. Critics ask how we can attach monetary values to such “priceless” resources without devaluing them. the problem with this critique is that we need a common yardstick for comparing costs and benefits. expressing them in dollar terms is often convenient, simply because the costs of implementing a government pol- icy are often naturally expressed in monetary terms,such as the increase in electricity bills that would result from more stringent pollution controls on power plants.
> of course, a critic might respond that any attempt to make benefits and costs commensurate is problematic, regardless of the metric used. in a world of limited resources, however, tradeoffs must be made between competing demands.Weighing costs and benefits is simply a way of assess- ing those tradeoffs.as nobel laureate robert solow has argued,
> Cost–benefit analysis is needed only when society must give up some of one good thing in order to get more of another good thing. . . .the underlying rationale of cost–benefit analysis is that the cost of the good thing to be obtained is precisely the good thing that must or will be given up to obtain it.26
> a related critique holds that there is a moral imperative to protect the environment, making the monetary value of no consequence. a problem with such arguments is that they overlook other conflicting but equally valid appeals to morality. if saving the endangered spotted owl in the U.s. Pacific northwest is the morally right thing to do, what about saving the jobs of loggers whose livelihoods depend on cutting down trees? if protecting the amazonian rainforest from slash-and-burn agriculture is a moral imperative, what about making sure that people clearing that land to farm it have enough to eat? at the very least, expressing benefits and costs in monetary terms can help inform these tradeoffs.
> to make this concrete, let’s consider the control of mercury emis- sions from electric power plants. some might argue that the health risks from mercury pollution are so great that mercury should be controlled at all costs. if this argument sounds appealing, ask yourself how much you
> 
> the benefits and costs of environmental protection 61
> would be willing to pay in higher electricity bills each month in order to help pay for the costs of installing and operating mercury controls. Would you be willing to pay $5 a month? $10? $100? $1,000? how would your answer depend on the benefits to you and your family (and society at large) from controlling mercury pollution? Presumably, if the benefits were small enough and the costs were high enough, you might conclude that the emission controls would not be worthwhile. spending more money on higher electricity bills to pay for pollution control neces- sarily entails spending less money on something else that you value. it is in this sense that money is a useful measure of benefits—not because we think there ought to be an intrinsic dollar value put on everything but because tradeoffs must be made.
> Finally, it is worth pointing out that whether we realize it or not, we end up putting implicit values on environmental quality through the decisions we make every day. if you buy conventionally grown fruit and vegetables rather than the more expensive organic alternatives, you are putting a value on the environment.the same is true if you drive rather than bike to work or to school.the question is not whether we put a value on the environment. rather, the question is whether or not we make that value explicit.
> “Benefit–Cost Analysis Ignores the Losers from a Policy”
> a fourth major criticism of benefit–cost analysis is directed more broadly at the notion of using economic efficiency as a criterion for social welfare. as we have seen, efficiency is concerned with the overall net benefits to society from a policy, not with who gains and who loses. For example, the allowance trading program of the 1990 Clean air act amendments reduced sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants by roughly 50 percent in the latter half of the 1990s, at much lower cost than had been expected. (We’ll learn more about the trading program in Chapter 10, when we discuss market-based environmental policies.) Careful analysis has found that the benefits from that program—principally reduced mor- tality and morbidity from air pollution in cities of major power plants— far outweighed the costs of reducing so emissions.27

>  What Happens When Costs and Benefits Are Not Considered Systematically?
> A compelling argument for benefit–cost analysis is that when such analysis is not performed, actual policy may reflect implicit biases rather than reasoned considerations.28 A study of endangered species management by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) illustrates this point. Andrew Metrick and Mar- tin Weitzman gathered data on the amount of money spent on endangered species protection, along with data on a variety of species characteristics, in- cluding “scientific” attributes such as genetic uniqueness and degree of en- dangerment, along with “visceral” attributes such as the size of the animal. They found that the USFWS tends to lavish money on protecting animals that are physically appealing, even though they have reasonably large breeding populations and close genetic relatives in no danger of extinction. At the same time, little money is spent on species that face far greater risk of extinction (such as the monitor gecko or the Choctawahatchee beach mouse) or that are genetically unique (such as the Red Hills salamander or the Alabama cave fish). Indeed, the amount of money spent to protect listed species was strongly and positively correlated with size but negatively correlated with an objective mea- sure of endangerment.
> In short, spending by the USFWS on endangered species is biased toward “charismatic megafauna” such as grizzly bears rather than adhering to the sci- entific principles and priority setting that ostensibly guide decisions. We are not arguing that society should elevate scientific standards over other reasons people might value endangered species. Rather, the point is that the USFWS is not meeting the criteria it sets for itself as its goals, in part because of an absence of a calculation of the benefits and costs of protecting different spe- cies. As the authors conclude in another article on the topic, good stewardship requires “confronting honestly the core problem of economic tradeoffs—be- cause good stewardship of natural habitats, like almost everything else we want in this world, is subject to budget constraints. The evidence suggests that our actual behavior may not reflect a reasoned cost–benefit calculation.”
> aggregate,Westvirginia coal miners may well have ended up worse off as Wyoming coal displaced some West virginia coal. the costs of sulfur dioxide control also fell heavily on electric utilities in the Midwest, which passed the costs on to their ratepayers in the form of higher electric bills. the benefits from clean air, meanwhile, accrued to residents of downwind cities and to anglers and hikers who gained from the reduction in acid rain in the adirondacks and elsewhere.
> 
> the benefits and costs of environmental protection 63
> a program can be economically efficient, therefore, and still not make everyone better off. in simple terms, efficiency is about “maximizing the size of the pie,” whereas distributional equity is about who gets what share of the pie.this potential conflict between efficiency and distributional equity is fundamental,and it is an issue that merits careful consideration in each instance. if efficiency ignores something as critical as distributional equity, you may ask, why should we use it as a benchmark for policy? the answer is twofold: efficiency provides a welfare criterion that is both fundamentally sound and implementable in practice.
> the philosophical foundations of efficiency date back to the work of italian economist vilfredo Pareto at the end of the nineteenth century. Pareto proposed that one policy is superior to another if at least one person is strictly better off under the first policy and nobody is worse off. a policy is Pareto efficient if—and only if—no member of society could be made better off by an alternative policy without making at least one person worse off.
> as a criterion for comparing a proposed policy with the status quo, Pareto efficiency has a certain appeal. if policy a makes at least one person better off than policy B, without harming anyone, would we not always want to adopt policy a?29 When we try to apply this criterion in the real world, however, a drawback becomes clear: it is much too strict. Using it as a guide to making policy would almost always favor the status quo. think of nearly any medical or technological breakthrough that was un- doubtedly beneficial to society as a whole, and you can come up with at least one group of people who were hurt by the change.the rapid expan- sion of the railroad in the second half of the nineteenth century spurred the development of the western United states, brought fresh meat and produce to urban populations, and led to the rise of Chicago as a great city, but it also put bargemen out of business on now-obsolete canals and contributed to the overexploitation of natural resources such as the american bison. the development of the personal computer, for all its undeniable benefits, also devalued the skills of professional typists and shuttered countless old typewriter

> the 1930s. Under the kaldor–hicks or “potential Pareto” criterion, policy a is chosen over policy B if policy a would make at least one person better off without making anyone worse off, provided that suitable transfers were made from the winners to the losers. Crucially, the kaldor–hicks crite- rion does not require that those transfers are actually carried out. in other words, the modified criterion can be thought of as satisfying the strict Pareto criterion in principle, given appropriate (but possibly unfulfilled) transfers. of course, compensating the losers from a given policy is much easier to describe than to carry out. nonetheless, it remains crucial that such transfers be possible, even if only in theory, because the possibility of such compensation ensures that there is a net surplus from the policy. the winners from a policy can only compensate the losers (even in principle) if the benefits from the policy are greater than the losses.thus, a policy satisfies the modified criterion if and only if it produces greater net ben- efits than the alternative. satisfying the kaldor–hicks criterion is equiva- lent to maximizing net benefits.30
> the kaldor–hicks approach also helps clarify the relationship between efficiency and distributional equity. Because the compensating transfers need not actually take place, an efficient policy may lead to one group gaining much at the expense of another. if we are interested in distribu- tional equity, this indifference to whether the transfers occur is a crucial flaw.
> three main responses are possible to such a critique. First, one can simply point out that efficiency and distributional equity are competing goals that both deserve consideration when we are shaping environmental policy, or policy in any other sphere. second, we might argue that over time and across a broad range of policies, the gains and losses enjoyed by any particular group of people in any particular case tend to cancel each other out—so that in the long run, pursuing efficient policies will improve everyone’s lot. if today’s winners are tomorrow’s losers, then we need not concern ourselves too much with the distributional implications of particular policies. however, such a sanguine view of affairs is clearly
>  A policy satisfies the potential Pareto criterion if it would be Pareto efficient provided that the winners from the policy compensated the losers, but such transfers do not actually have to take place.
> naive when it comes to the impacts of much public policy in market economies such as the United states, where in the absence of redistribu- tive programs the pursuit of eco- nomic efficiency is likely to further concentrate wealth in the hands of a few.
> a third response to the critique
>  
> the benefits and costs of environmental protection 65
> is to find creative ways to spread the gains from efficient policies.a real- world example of just such a compensation program is the northwest Forest Plan, enacted in 1993 by the Clinton administration. the forest plan grew out of concern over declining populations of northern spotted owls and the old-growth habitat they depended on.to protect the owl and its habitat, the plan sharply reduced the allowable timber harvest on 24.5 million acres of federally owned lands in Washington, oregon, and northern California. Loggers in the local timber industry were among the most vocal opponents of such conservation measures; pickups and log- ging trucks sported bumper stickers reading “save a Logger: eat a spot- ted owl” and “spotted owl tastes Like Chicken.” in response to such concerns, the Clinton administration proposed a northwest economic adjustment initiative.that program provided $1.2 billion over 6 years in additional funding to cushion the blow to logging communities, through job retraining, rural development assistance, and direct payments.
> Benefit–Cost Analysis Under Uncertainty
> in many cases, the benefits and costs of a policy may depend on key pa- rameters that are uncertain. For example, the benefits of fuel economy standards will depend in part on the future price of gasoline. or the source of uncertainty may be the challenges inherent in estimating the health effects of pollution; in estimating the benefits from reducing con- centrations of soot and other fine particles, ePa uses two empirical esti- mates of the effect of particulate matter on mortality, derived from two different peer-reviewed epidemiological studies.
> if the uncertainty is limited to one or two key parameters, as in those examples, then it can be dealt with by performing a sensitivity analy- sis. Benefits and costs are calculated under a range of values for a given parameter (e.g., high or low gasoline prices) and displayed along with those from the base case, allowing the analyst to determine how sensitive the main results are to alternative assumptions.this is similar to estimat- ing benefits and costs under a range of discount rates, another common practice.
> in more complex situations, with multiple sources of uncertainty, ana- lysts may use a more sophisticated method called a Monte Carlo analysis. in this approach, the analyst specifies the likelihood of various parameter values (for example, an oil price of $80 per barrel in the year 2020 may be deemed more likely than prices of $150 per barrel or $20 per barrel). Benefits and costs are then calculated hundreds or even thousands of times, each with a different set (or “draw”) of parameter values.the result

>  Analyzing Uncertain Benefits and Costs of Regulation: EPA’s Carbon Pollution Standards for New Power Plants*
> In early 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was preparing a pro- posal for the first-ever performance standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new coal and natural-gas-fired electric power plants. (Power plants that already existed at the time the rule was proposed would be covered by a sub- sequent regulation.) The agency intended to tie the standard to the emissions rate from a state-of-the-art, natural-gas-fired plant. Because natural gas emits roughly half as much CO2 as coal per megawatt-hour of electricity generation, the proposed standards would effectively prohibit the construction of “conven- tional” coal-fired power plants (those without equipment to capture and store carbon emissions).
> EPA planned to argue that the regulation would have zero costs and zero benefits. This was because under a business-as-usual scenario without the new standards, no conventional coal-fired power plants were expected to be built. That expectation was partly due to the cost of complying with regula- tions on other pollutants such as mercury. But the main reason that no new coal plants were planned was historically low natural gas prices, the result of the vast supplies of natural gas that could be tapped by the newly perfected technologies of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. If the current low price of natural gas continued into the future, conventional coal- fired power plants would remain uneconomical regardless of the new carbon standards.
> EPA’s argument of zero costs and zero benefits raised eyebrows at the Of- fice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, part of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which has responsibility for reviewing regulations. How could such a significant and even historic regulation—one that would ef- fectively end the construction of conventional coal-fired power plants in the United States—have zero costs? Others asked, “If the regulation genuinely had zero benefits, why bother pursuing it when there was sure to be fierce op- position to the regulation on Capitol Hill?”
> These questions pointed to the need for a more sophisticated approach. The key was to realize that whether coal-fired plants would be built in the ab- sence of the regulation depended critically on the price of natural gas, which was uncertain. To correctly assess the expected benefits and costs of the regu- lation, the analysis needed to at least account for the possibility that future natural gas prices would be high enough to make coal plants economically attractive again.

> 
>  Analyzing Uncertain Benefits and Costs of Regulation continued
> EPA’s resulting calculation for a representative new coal-fired plant, re- ported in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the proposed rule, is illus- trated in figure 3.3. For natural gas prices below $9.60 per mmBtu, coal would be uneconomical, and the costs and benefits of the standard would be zero. That was the business-as-usual case that EPA had assumed at first. For natural gas prices above that level, however, a utility would prefer to build a coal-fired plant. Note that immediately above this price threshold, the cost savings from coal would be essentially zero, but the social damages from increased pollu- tion would be significant. Therefore, for prices in some range above the thresh- old, the proposed standards would yield positive net benefits, because the extra cost of having to burn natural gas instead of coal would be outweighed by the benefits from lower emissions. As the natural gas price rose higher, the extra costs of natural gas would increase, while the benefits from lower pollu- tion remained constant. Above some price point ($12.70 per mmBtu in the fig- ure; EPA’s analysis identified a range of $12 to $14 per mmBtu for this second threshold), the extra costs would outweigh the benefits, and a prohibition on conventional coal plants would begin to impose net social costs.
> The final step in EPA’s analysis was to consider the likelihood that the price would fall into each of those three ranges. Historical data showed that natural gas prices had never reached the $9.60 per mmBtu threshold on an annual average basis and had exceeded it even temporarily in only 8 of the previous 120 months. And the advent of fracking meant that natural gas prices were expected to be much lower than historical levels (more on this in Chapter 6). Even the most pessimistic natural gas forecasts available projected prices re- maining below $9.60 per mmBtu through 2035. These facts suggested that the probability of the proposed standard yielding net benefits was positive but small, and the probability that it would impose net costs was essentially zero. As a result, expected net benefits were greater than zero (although small in magnitude).

> is a distribution of benefits and costs rather than a single estimate. rather than simply comparing the outcomes under a discrete set of parameter values, as in a sensitivity analysis, the Monte Carlo approach allows ana- lysts to explore a much broader range of possible benefits and costs and to see which outcomes are more or less likely (given the specified distri- butions of the parameter values). For example, two policies with similar average net benefits may have different probabilities that net benefits will be much higher or lower than expected, a finding that could be of interest to policymakers interested in minimizing the risk of bad outcomes (such as a policy imposing net costs).
> Conclusion
> this chapter has fleshed out the concept of economic efficiency that we developed in Chapter 2. in order to put the efficiency criterion into practice, we need to be able to measure costs and benefits. Costs are more straightforward to define and to measure. even so, economics raises two key insights:the costs of doing one thing depend on the opportunities forgone, and the burden is often shared by many groups in society. the benefits from environmental amenities—as from any other good—ulti- mately derive from what people are willing to pay to secure them. econo- mists have devised a range of clever approaches to infer such willingness to pay from how people behave when they go on vacation, buy a house, or accept a job. nonetheless, in some cases—for example, the existence of an endangered species—there is no alternative but to ask people how much they value a good.
> even if we can measure costs and benefits, it is important to have a firm grasp on why economic efficiency is a desirable goal for society.as a criterion for policymaking, efficiency has two important strengths: it is grounded in a strong welfare justification (recall the Pareto criterion it is based on), but at the same time it is readily implemented in practice. nonetheless, there are powerful critiques of efficiency and of the related practice of benefit–cost analysis. in particular, a single-minded focus on efficiency can mask deeply unfair outcomes, if the positive net benefits reflect large gains to one group of people at the expense of another. keep- ing this blind spot in mind, however, we shall use efficiency throughout the remainder of the book as our basic benchmark for evaluating envi- ronmental policy and the management of natural resources.

**assistant**:
> Certainly, here are some multiple-choice questions based on the excerpt you provided:
> 
> 1. **Benefit-Cost Analysis Role in Environmental Policy:**
>    - A) What is the main purpose of benefit-cost analysis according to economic theory?
>      1. To ensure that all political and moral considerations are prioritized.
>      2. To compare the monetary equivalence of various policy outcomes.
>      3. To improve information availability for decision-makers and optimize efficiency.
>      4. To establish strict rules for environmental regulation without exception.
>    - Correct Answer: 3
>    
> 2. **Economic Analysis in Environmental Statutes:**
>    - B) According to the excerpt, how do U.S. environmental statutes vary in their use of economic analysis?
>      1. All U.S. environmental statutes require benefit-cost analyses for new policies.
>      2. Economic analysis is consistently used across all environmental statutes.
>      3. There is a spectrum from forbidding to requiring economic analysis, depending on the statute.
>      4. Economic analysis is only used in situations of extreme environmental threat.
>    - Correct Answer: 3
> 
> 3. **Estimation of Global Ecosystem Services:**
>    - C) What main error did Robert Costanza and colleagues make in their method of estimating the value of global ecosystem services?
>      1. They failed to include all types of ecosystem services in their study.
>      2. They used marginal willingness to pay to estimate total values instead of average willingness to pay.
>      3. They underestimated the growth rate of the global economy.
>      4. They overvalued recreational services compared to other ecosystem services.
>    - Correct Answer: 2
> 
> 4. **Discounting Future Benefits:**
>    - D) What critique is made about discounting future benefits in benefit-cost analysis?
>      1. Discounting does not effectively measure the immediate benefits.
>      2. Discounting appropriately balances the interests of current and future generations.
>      3. Discounting undervalues future benefits, possibly privileging current generations.
>      4. Discounting is too complex to apply in practice.
>    - Correct Answer: 3
> 
> 5. **Critiques of Benefit-Cost Analysis:**
>    - E) Which of the following is NOT one of the critiques against benefit-cost analysis mentioned in the text?
>      1. It devalues non-monetary aspects like clean air or water when expressed in monetary terms.
>      2. It overlooks important distributional outcomes and who benefits or loses from policies.
>      3. It exclusively focuses on maximizing profits for private companies.
>      4. It may ignore fundamental rights or duties for the sake of efficiency.
>    - Correct Answer: 3
> 
> These questions aim to ensure that students have a comprehensive understanding of the main points in the excerpt, ranging from the purpose of benefit-cost analysis to its critiques and limitations in environmental decision-making.
