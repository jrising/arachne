> I am writing a story of one of my ancestors, and the story takes place in Norwich, UK during the Elizabethan era (specifically, 1563 - 1574). In a later story (two generations later), an ancestor meets a comic-relief character, a rat named Sergeant Buzfuz. I want to introduce a related character-- an ancestor of Buzfuz-- and I think it can be a rat that comes over with the Great Stranger Migration of Dutch and Flemish protestants. Ideally, this rat would have a name that is (1) interpretable in Dutch/Flemish, and (2) provides insight into the origin of Buzfuz's silly name. Any ideas?

> - **Interpretability in Dutch/Flemish:** 
>   - **Pijp** means "pipe" in Dutch, which could help hint towards a typically comic or whimsical connotation.

>   - The silly, buzzing nature of "Buzfuz" can be linked to "Pijptek" through their whimsical sounds and the playful construction of both names.
>   - "Buzfuz" could have evolved from playful nicknaming traditions over generations, starting with a similarly odd and playful name like "Pijptek."
> 
> ### Narrative Context:
> - **Great Stranger Migration:** 
>   - The rat "Sergeant Pijptek" could be a stowaway on one of the ships carrying Dutch/Flemish protestants to Norwich. 
>   - Known for his penchant for nibbling on tobacco pipes (hence the name), he becomes a small but notable part of the newcomers’ folklore, eventually leading to the "Buzfuz" lineage.
>   
> - **Character Traits:**
>   - Sergeant Pijptek can be depicted with a fondness for mischief around the pipes and a curious, adventurous nature, setting the stage for a lineage of unique and quirky rodent characters.
