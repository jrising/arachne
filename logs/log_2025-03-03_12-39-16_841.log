> It appears that there might be a few typos in your request, making the context a bit unclear. It seems like you're asking for help to redefine your approach to work,To reframe the approach to work without using an offensive or defensive strategy, you can focus on a collaborative and empowering approach that emphasizes partnership, community engagement, and inclusive decision-making. 
> 
> Instead of positioning your efforts as offensive or defensive, you can highlight how you are working in partnership with state and local governments, community-based organizations, and other stakeholders to drive positive policy change and ensure equitable outcomes. Here are some suggestions based on the provided goals:
> 
> 1. **Collaborative Engagement:** Emphasize collaborative efforts with city and state governments and community partners to co-create and implement building decarbonization policies. Highlight the importance of shared decision-making and co-governance structures that empower communities and ensure their needs are met.
> 
> 2. **Empowerment through Education:** Focus on providing training and support to local leaders and community members to advocate for energy democracy, green jobs, and sustainable building practices. By empowering stakeholders with knowledge and skills, you can foster a sense of ownership and commitment to the shared goals.
> 
> 3. **Community-Centered Policy Development:** Showcase how your organization is working to connect technical policy aspects with community needs, ensuring that adopted policies are not only efficient but also community-focused. Highlight the importance of listening to and incorporating the perspectives of diverse community members in the policy-making process.
> 
> 4. **Legal Support for Equitable Policies:** Frame your legal strategies as supporting the development of equitable building decarbonization policies by providing guidance, model policies, and legal frameworks. Emphasize how legal support can help accelerate policy implementation and expand local regulatory authority in a fair and transparent manner.

Since early 2024, IMT has strengthened collaboration infrastructure between several city and state governments and community-based organization (CBO) partners in an effort to not only pass equitable building decarbonization policies, but also to create lasting partnerships that will protect current gains while guiding future policy creation. EBAC supports this work through customized, place-based technical and community engagement assistance. Current examples of this work include: 
> Chicago: Partnering with People for Community Recovery and Department of Environment to identify and facilitate co-governance structures to share decision making power for building decarbonization policy implementation. 
> Washington DC: Partnering with Washington Interfaith Network and the Department of Energy and Environment to advance a pilot program for small buildings to upgrade their energy efficiency infrastructure (ex. adding heat pumps) while maximizing community benefits. We will also facilitate training for local leaders to feel empowered to advocate around energy democracy, electrification, green jobs, and building performance policies.
> Philadelphia, PA: Partnering with POWER Interfaith and the Office of Sustainability to connect technical building performance policy aspects with community needs so an adopted building performance policy is both efficient and community-focused. 
> Proactive legal strategies: collaborating with our legal partner, Public Health Law Center (PHLC) to develop and strengthen model policies, legal frameworks on building decarbonization policies like BPS and Community Accountability Boards (CAB), and revenue-raising mechanisms that accelerate equitable building decarbonization and expand local regulatory authority.
> 
> Defense Goals: We are safeguarding the progress cities and states have made in furthering climate justice and energy efficiency goals by providing trusted, timely, and accurate information about how to effectively and equitably create, adopt, and implement building performance policies to decarbonize the built environment. Examples of these efforts include: 
> Share IMT’s Community Engagement framework with governments to facilitate bridging bonds across diverse constituencies, leading to more equitable and efficient policy creation
> Lead an interdepartmental team of IMT staff dedicated to building long-term power in the energy efficiency field while pushing for increased, sector wide community engagement efforts
> Facilitate gatherings between governments and CBOs to discuss their approach to equitable building decarbonization policies, and pathways to move the work forward.
> Survey, design, and facilitate cohort-based or stakeholder-specific offerings that educate and inform partners about effective community engagement during this new administration
> Defend current and developing building decarbonization policies against legal challenges by working with Public Health Law Center (PHLC), to provide strategic guidance and direct legal assistance to jurisdictions facing litigation. This includes tracking and analyzing EPCA preemption cases and developing legal memos. Through webinars, convenings, and direct support, we ensure that policymakers and advocates are informed and prepared to defend their policies against industry pushback.
