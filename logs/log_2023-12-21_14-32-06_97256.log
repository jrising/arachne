**user**:
> What is an appropriate representation of absolute time (not dependent upon timezone) that I can save in a yaml file in python?
**assistant**:
> A good representation of absolute time, not dependent on timezone, would be Unix/Epoch time. Unix time (also known as Epoch time) is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds. It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats.
> 
> As a standardized and absolute time format, it eliminates ambiguity and makes it a highly efficient format for encoding time.
> 
> In Python, you'd use the time package to get the Unix timestamp. For example:
> 
> ```python
> import time
> timestamp = time.time()
> ```
> 
> This `timestamp` variable can now be saved to your yaml file.
> 
> Do note that Unix timestamps are UTC based. When reading the timestamps, remember to convert back to the appropriate timezone if needed.
