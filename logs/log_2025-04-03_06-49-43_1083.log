> Q3.2 Systemic dimension:
> 
> The systemic dimension of water stress, particularly in the Colorado River basin, poses significant risks. Large sellers of water rights are strongly affected by these conditions. High water prices could render irrigation unaffordable for many small farmers, affecting their profitability and ability to sustain their businesses. The adverse impact on the Colorado River could escalate costs and influence the broader financial system, potentially causing feedback loops within the real economy. Increased prices might impact multiple businesses simultaneously, leading to heightened credit and market risks across various exposures, which could affect numerous financial institutions.
> 
> Persistent droughts in the Colorado River have led to increased expenses for alternative energy sources due to decreased hydroelectric power generation. Similarly, water shortages may impact agricultural industries, driving up food prices and commodities like tomatoes, cotton, corn, and cattle feed. For instance, there was a 45 percent rise in cattle feed prices during the severe Colorado drought of 2010 to 2011. Contagion effects in commodity markets are also possible. The introduction of the water futures market in California has heightened the commodification and privatization of water, potentially leading to speculation and manipulation of water prices that adversely affect businesses and financial institutions. Through this futures market, feedback loops might develop between the financial market and the real economy, posing challenges for small farmers.

> Q3.3 Endogenous risk:
> 
> Economic activities negatively affecting the Colorado Basin are often financed by financial institutions, thus amplifying nature-related financial risks that arise from ecosystem degradation. This includes financing water-intensive agriculture, such as alfalfa, grasses, and corn silage for livestock feed, as well as hydropower projects and investments in unsustainable tourism and leisure practices, such as resorts and water-intensive residential amenities like golf courses.
> 
> Conversely, positive impacts may result from financing sustainable business practices and necessary transitions. This includes investments in sustainable agriculture, crop diversification, and energy source diversification. Illustrative examples include acquiring water rights for ecological benefits, implementing high-efficiency irrigation on tribal reservations, and restoring perennial flows to enhance groundwater resources. Some financial institutions are contributing by covering approximately six to ten percent of the water-saving expenses incurred by farmers.
