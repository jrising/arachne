**user**:
> Is an estimate of 0.595 (standard error of 0.19) statistically different from an estimate of 0.611 (standard error of 0.007)?
**assistant**:
> To determine whether the two estimates are statistically different, you can perform a test for the difference between two independent means. 
> 
> We need to calculate a Z-score and then check if the absolute Z-score exceeds the critical value at a desired significance level. 
> 
> The formula to calculate this Z-score is:
> 
>     Z = (X1 - X2) / sqrt(SE1^2 + SE2^2)
> 
> Where:
> - `X1` = Estimate1
> - `X2` = Estimate2
> - `SE1` = Standard Error of the first estimate
> - `SE2` = Standard Error of the second estimate
> 
> Filling in with your values:
> 
>     Z = (0.595 - 0.611) / sqrt((0.19)^2 + (0.007)^2) = -0.016 / sqrt(0.0361 + 0.000049) = -0.016 / 0.190263
> 
> Thus:
> 
>     The calculated Z is approximately -0.084. 
> 
> Assuming a conventional two-tailed test at a .05 significance level, we require a Z-score above 1.96 or below -1.96 to reject the null hypothesis that the two estimates are the same.
> 
> Given that -0.084 is contained within that range (-1.96 to 1.96), we would not reject the null hypothesis, so we can say that, statistically, there is not sufficient evidence to show the estimates are different.
