> The kind of distribution that does not have a well-defined mean is typically referred to as a **heavy-tailed distribution**, specifically one that belongs to the class of distributions with infinite mean. This usually arises when the distribution's tail probability decreases at a rate slower than exponential decline, often with a power-law form.
> 
> A well-known example of such a distribution is the **Cauchy distribution**, which is a type of heavy-tailed distribution. It has undefined mean and variance because the tail's weight is too heavy, causing the integral corresponding to the mean (expectation) to diverge.
> 
> In general, some fat-tailed or long-tailed distributions might also have moments (such as mean and variance) that are not well-defined, depending on the specific form and parameters of the distribution. The key point distinguishing whether a mean is defined often relates to the order of the moment and how quickly the tail probabilities decline.

> Can you explain Weitzman’s Dismal Theorem?
**assistant**:
> Weitzman’s Dismal Theorem is a pivotal concept in the economics of climate change and the evaluation of long-term risks. Proposed by economist Martin Weitzman, it suggests that the possibility of catastrophic outcomes in the distant future should have a substantial impact on our decisions regarding climate change policy and investment.
> 
> ### Key Points of Weitzman’s Dismal Theorem
> 
> 1. **Discounting Future Value**: Traditional economic models often apply a discount rate to future cash flows or benefits, reflecting the idea that money today is worth more than money in the future. However, Weitzman argues that for very long-term outcomes—such as those related to climate change—this approach may underestimate the potential for catastrophic impacts.
> 
> 2. **Fat-Tailed Distributions**: The theorem acknowledges that the likelihood of extreme negative outcomes (like irreversible climate damage) can be modeled using fat-tailed distributions. These distributions imply that there’s a significant probability of very high (or catastrophic) costs occurring in the future, even if the average outcomes might be more favorable.
> 
> 3. **Role of Uncertainty**: Weitzman emphasizes that uncertainty about future outcomes is profound and important. If the potential for catastrophic events is not adequately accounted for, policymakers may underestimate the risks associated with climate change.
> 
> 4. **Implications for Policy**: The theorem suggests that because of the potential for catastrophic outcomes with low probabilities, it may be necessary to take more aggressive action against climate change today rather than deferring actions based on current discounted costs. Essentially, it promotes the idea that even rare catastrophic events should significantly influence our policy-making.
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> Weitzman’s Dismal Theorem fundamentally challenges standard economic approaches to climate policy by highlighting the importance of unlikely but devastating risks. It advocates for a re-evaluation of how we discount the future in the context of climate change, thereby suggesting that it may be prudent to invest significantly in mitigation strategies even when the outcomes appear uncertain or far-off. This approach encourages a more precautionary stance given the potential global consequences of climate inaction.
