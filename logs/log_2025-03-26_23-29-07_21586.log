**assistant**:
> In 17th-century Salem, people of African descent who were enslaved would likely have been referred to as "slaves," among other terms of the time. Historical records from colonial America often used "slave" to denote the status of individuals subjected to enforced servitude. Other terms that might have been used included "servants" (sometimes specified as "negro servants" to indicate African descent), which could apply to both indentured servants and slaves, though the legal status and conditions were distinct. It's important to note that the terminology would have reflected the racial hierarchies and attitudes of the period, often dehumanizing and disregarding the individuality and humanity of enslaved people.
