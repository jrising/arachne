> 1. Introduction
> Nowadays, decisionmakers face deep uncertainties about a
> myriad of external factors, such as climate change, population
> growth, new technologies, economic developments, and their
> impacts. Moreover, not only environmental conditions, but also
> societal perspectives and preferences may change over time,
> including stakeholders’ interests and their evaluation of plans
> (Offermans, 2010; van der Brugge et al., 2005). Traditionally,
> decisionmakers in many policy domains, including water management, assume that the future can be predicted. They develop a
> static ‘optimal’ plan using a single ‘most likely’ future (often based
> on the extrapolation of trends) or a static ‘robust’ plan that will
> produce acceptable outcomes in most plausible future worlds
> (Dessai and Hulme, 2007; Dessai and Van der Sluijs, 2007;
> Hallegatte et al., 2012). However, if the future turns out to be
> different from the hypothesized future(s), the plan is likely to fail.
> McInerney et al. (2012) liken this to ‘‘dancing on the top of a
> needle’’. But, as the future unfolds policymakers learn and usually
> respond to the new situation by adapting their plans (ad hoc) to the
> new reality. Adaptation over the course of time is not only
> determined by what is known or anticipated at present, but also by
> what is experienced and learned as the future unfolds (Yohe, 1990)
> and by the policy responses to events (Haasnoot et al., 2012). Thus,
> policymaking becomes part of the storyline, and thereby an
> essential component of the total uncertainty – in fact, Hallegatte
> et al. (2012) include the adaptation of decisions over time in an
> updated definition of ‘deep uncertainty’.
> To address these deep uncertainties, a new planning paradigm
> has emerged. This paradigm holds that, in light of the deep
> uncertainties, one needs to design dynamic adaptive plans

> According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term
> actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its
> dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for
> decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called ‘Dynamic Adaptive Policy
> Pathways’. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans:
> ‘Adaptive Policymaking’ and ‘Adaptation Pathways’. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach
> describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. ‘mitigating actions’ and ‘hedging
> actions’) and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways
> provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on
> alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways
> approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the
> Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political,
> technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test

> 2.1. Adaptation Pathways
> The Adaptation Pathways approach is summarized in Figs. 1
> and 2 (Haasnoot et al., 2011, 2012). Central to adaptation pathways
> are adaption tipping points (Kwadijk et al., 2010), which are the

> specified objectives. The timing of the adaptation point for a given
> action, its sell-by date, is scenario dependent. After reaching a
> tipping point, additional actions are needed. As a result, a pathway
> emerges. The Adaptation Pathways approach presents a sequence
> of possible actions after a tipping point in the form of adaptation
> trees (e.g. like a decision tree or a roadmap). Any given route
> through the tree is an adaptation pathway. Typically, this approach
> uses computational scenario approaches to assess the distribution
> of the sell-by date of several actions across a large ensemble of
> transient scenarios. This distribution can be summarized in boxwhisker plots, and the median or quartile values are used in
> generating an adaptation map. The exact date of a tipping point is
> not important; the moment should be roughly right — for example,
> ‘‘on average the tipping point will be reached within 50 years, at
> earliest within 40 years, and at latest within 60 years’’. The effects
> of sequences of actions can be assessed in the same way as
> individual actions. To cope with the presence of different
> stakeholders, values, and worldviews, cultural perspectives can
> be used to map these out (Hoekstra, 1998; Middelkoop et al., 2004;
> Offermans et al., 2011; Van Asselt and Rotmans, 1997).
> The Adaptation Pathways map, manually drawn based on
> model results or expertjudgment, presents an overview of relevant
> pathways (see Fig. 2 for an example). Similar to a Metro map (see,
> for example, http://www.wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm), the
> Adaptation Pathways map presents alternative routes to get to
> the same desired point in the future. All routes presented satisfy a
> pre-specified minimum performance level, such as a safety norm (a
> threshold that determines whether results are acceptable or not).
> They can, thus, be considered as ‘different ways leading to Rome’
> (as is true of different routes to a specified destination on the
> Metro). Also, the moment of an adaptation tipping point (terminal
> station), and the available actions after this point, are shown (via
> transfer stations). Due to unacceptable performance of some
> actions in a selection of scenarios, some routes are not always
> available (dashed lines). Decisionmakers or stakeholders may have
> a preference for certain pathways, since costs and benefits may

> adaptation map, decisionmakers can identify opportunities, noregret actions, lock-ins, and the timing of an action, in order to

> 2.2. Adaptive Policymaking
> Adaptive Policymaking is a generic structured approach for
> designing dynamic robust plans (Kwakkel et al., 2010a; Marchau
> et al., 2009; Ranger et al., 2010). Conceptually, Adaptive Policymaking is rooted in Assumption-Based Planning (Dewar et al.,
> 1993). Fig. 3 shows the steps of the Adaptive Policymaking
> approach for designing a dynamic adaptive plan (Kwakkel et al.,
> 2010a). In Step I, the existing conditions of a system are analyzed
> and the objectives for future development are specified. In Step II,
> the way in which these objectives are to be achieved is specified by
> assembling a basic plan. This basic plan is made more robust
> through four types of actions (Step III): mitigating actions (actions
> to reduce the likely adverse effects of a plan); hedging actions
> (actions to spread or reduce the uncertain adverse effects of a plan);
> seizing actions (actions taken to seize likely available opportunities); and shaping actions (actions taken to reduce failure or
> enhance success). Even with the actions taken in Step III, there is
> still the need to monitor the plan’s performance and to take action
> if necessary. This is called contingency planning (Step IV). Signposts
> specify information that should be tracked in order to determine
> whether the plan is meeting the conditions for its success. In
> addition, critical values of signpost variables (triggers) beyond
> which additional actions should be implemented are specified.
> There are four different types of actions that can be triggered by a
> signpost, which are specified in Step V: defensive actions (actions
> taken to clarify the basic plan, preserve its benefits, or meet outside
> challenges in response to specific triggers that leave the basic plan
> unchanged); corrective actions (adjustments to the basic plan);
> capitalizing actions (actions to take advantage of opportunities that
> can improve the performance of the basic plan); and a reassessment
> of the plan (initiated when the analysis and assumptions critical to
> the plan’s success have clearly lost validity).
> Once the complete plan has been designed, the actions to be
> taken immediately (from Step II and Step III) are implemented, and
> a monitoring system (from Step IV) is established. Then time starts
> running, signpost information related to the triggers is collected,
> and actions are started, altered, stopped, or expanded in response
> to this information. After implementation of the initial actions, the
> implementation of other actions (from Step V) is suspended until a
> trigger event occurs.
> 2.3. Comparison of the approaches
> Table 1 compares the features of Adaptive Policymaking and
> Adaptation Pathways. Both approaches aim at supporting decisionmakers in handling uncertainty in long-term decisionmaking
> and emphasize the need for adaptivity in plans in order to cope

> ‘success’ (as defined in step 1) is achieved. Note that actions need
> not be a single action, but can be a portfolio of actions, constructed
> after iteration of steps 3–5.
> The sixth step is to develop a manageable number of preferred

> specified perspective. It can be useful to specify two to four
> pathways that reflect different perspectives. This will result not

> ‘socially robust’ pathways (Offermans et al., 2011). The preferred
> pathways will form the basic structure of a dynamic adaptive plan
> (like the basic plan in the Adaptive Policymaking framework).
> The seventh step is to improve the robustness of the preferred
> pathways through contingency planning – in other words, to define
> actions to get and keep each of the pathways on track for success.
> In general, these are actions to anticipate and prepare for one or
> more preferred pathway (e.g. keep options open), and corrective
> actions to stay on track in case the future turns out differently than
> expected. We distinguish three types of contingency actions from
> Adaptive Policymaking: corrective, defensive, and capitalizing
> actions, which are associated with a monitoring system and trigger
> values. The monitoring system specifies what to monitor, and the
> triggers specify when a contingency action should be activated.
> The eighth step is to translate the results from all ofthe previous
> steps into a dynamic adaptive plan. This plan should answer the
> following question: Given the set of pathways and the uncertainties about the future, what actions/decisions should we take now
> (and which actions/decisions can be postponed)? The plan

> problems, and potential and preferred pathways. The challenge is
> to draft a plan that keeps the preferred pathways open for as long

> 4. Case study: Rhine Delta in the Netherlands
> We illustrate and test the approach of Dynamic Adaptive Policy
> Pathways for the lower Rhine Delta in the Netherlands, and focus
> on the IJsselmeer area. In 2007, the Government established the
> Second Delta Commission for identifying actions to prevent future
> disasters (Deltacommissie, 2008; Kabat et al., 2009), since the
> expected future climate change and sea level rise ‘can no longer be
> ignored’ (Deltacommissie, 2008, p. 5). The Commission’s advice
> resulted in the enactment of a Delta Act, and is presently being
> elaborated in a Delta Programme. The chair of the Delta
> Programme summarized their main challenge as follows: ‘‘One
> of the biggest challenges is dealing with uncertainties in the future
> climate, but also in population, economy and society. This requires a
> new way of planning, which we call adaptive delta planning. It seeks to
> maximize flexibility; keeping options open and avoiding ‘lock-in’’’
> (Kuijken, 2010). This corresponds well with our integrated
> approach, and thus provides an appropriate case to use as an
> illustration. However, we have made many simplifying assumptions. So, what follows can be used only for illustrative purposes
> and a first tentative test of our approach. The steps we mention
> refer to the steps in Fig. 4.
> 4.1. Steps 1 and 2: current situation and problem analysis
> The Netherlands is a densely populated country, two-thirds of
> which is vulnerable to being flooded by the sea or large rivers. A
> sophisticated and comprehensive water management system
> satisfies the water system requirements for living in a delta.
> But, for coping with future changes such as global climate change,
> adaptation may be needed. Having the right amount of water for
> users, at the right time, in the right place, and at socially acceptable
> costs is a key target for the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and
> Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat, 2011). The objective of the
> Delta Programme is ‘‘to protect the Netherlands from flooding and to
> ensure adequate supplies of freshwater for generations ahead.’’ (Delta
> Programme, 2011). Accordingly, we define ‘success’ as follows:
> ‘The plan will be successful if no floods occur, and if there is enough
> fresh water during the next 100 years. The frequency of water shortage
> will be at least similar to the present situation (once in 10 years a
> 490 M. Haasnoot et al. / Global Environmental Change 23 (2013) 485–498
> water shortage may occur).’ Constraints would include the various
> EU Directives that the Dutch Government must follow. For
> example, the Water Framework Directive implies that ecological
> and water quality objectives have to be met. These Directives
> imply that we need to add another target to our definition of
> success: ‘the plan will be successful if it does not result in negative
> impacts on nature’.
> 4.1.1. The water system and its functions in the current situation
> There are several key water characteristics that need further
> explanation for our case (see Fig. 5). After the Rhine enters the
> country, the water is distributed over three branches – the Waal,
> Nederrijn, and IJssel – by means of a weir at Driel. The IJssel
> supplies the IJsselmeer and Markermeer lakes with fresh water.
> The Afsluitdijk dam protects the adjacent areas from flooding and
> enables water storage in the lakes. The levels of the IJsselmeer and
> Markermeer are carefully maintained with sluices, to ensure safety
> in the winter and enough fresh water in the summer. Safety from
> flooding is expressed in standards of a probability per year that a
> critical water level will occur – e.g. 1:1250 years (Rijkswaterstaat,
> 2011). These standards (also called ‘norm frequencies’) are laid
> down by law for every dike ring area, and depend largely on the
> economic activities, the number of inhabitants, and flood
> characteristics associated with the dike ring. The Haringvliet
> sluice gates and the Maeslantkering protect the Rhine estuary from
> (mainly coastal) flooding. The Haringvliet sluices also limit salt
> intrusion into the river.
> The IJsselmeer and Markermeer are the main water reservoirs
> in the lower Rhine Delta. During dry periods, water from these
> lakes is used to supply large parts of the Netherlands. Despite the
> extensive network of ditches and canals and the large amount of
> water storage, the water supply is insufficient to fulfill the fresh
> water demands during dry periods. During such periods, a priority
> list is used to distribute fresh water for different uses. The major
> uses of water are for agriculture (for irrigation), for flushing (to
> mitigate adverse impacts for agriculture and drinking water from
> the upward seepage of salt water and salt intrusion in the
> waterways near Rotterdam), and for water management itself (to
> maintain water levels in the lakes and canals). Drinking water and
> industry are also important uses, although the quantity used for
> these is negligible compared to the other uses.
> 4.1.2. The water system and its functions in the future
> Future socio-economic developments, climate change, and sea
> level rise, may require changes to the water management system.
> Recently, four water-related scenarios were developed for the
> Netherlands (Bruggeman et al., 2011; Te Linde et al., submitted).
> These ‘Deltascenarios’ cover two representations of future climate
> (based on Van den Hurk et al., 2007) and two sets of socioeconomic developments in the Netherlands. The climate scenarios
> cover a range from moderate increases in temperature and
> precipitation (1 8C, 3.6% precipitation in the winter, and 2.8% in
> the summer; used in the scenario ‘Crowd’) to a large temperature
> increase (2 8C in 2100; used in the scenario ‘Warm’), a large

> precipitation increase in winter (14.2%), and a large precipitation
> decrease in the summer (19%). The sea level can increase (35–
> 85 cm in 2100). The socio-economic scenarios describe a population change from the current 16 million to 12 million or 24 million
> in 2100, together with major changes in agricultural land use.
> These scenarios would result in an increase in water demands from
> the regional areas to the national water system due to less rain and
> lower river discharges, more salt intrusion, and/or agricultural
> changes; and an increase in flood risk due to sea level rise, higher
> river discharges, and population and economic growth.
> 4.2. Step 3: determine actions
> For illustrative purposes, we focus on the IJsselmeer area, and
> consider in our analysis only the main alternative actions, whereas
> in reality the entire Rhine Delta and all kinds of combinations of
> actions are possible. As a result of our problem analysis, it is clear
> that the IJsselmeer area will become even more important as a
> storage basin for providing fresh water in times of drought. Either
> the water storage capacity needs to be increased, or the (growth in)
> water demand needs to be reduced. To increase the water storage,
> the water level of lake IJsselmeer can be either increased in the
> spring, and then used during dry periods, or decreased in dry
> periods. Water demands can be reduced by increasing the
> efficiency of water use in the regional system, by changing to
> salt and/or drought tolerant crops, and/or by decreasing agriculture or moving agriculture to areas with appropriate environmental conditions. Some of these actions can be taken without
> changing the current infrastructure; these can be considered as
> improvements of the current system. For other actions, the
> infrastructure would have to be changed considerably. To ensure
> safety from flooding in case of sea level rise and increased river
> discharges in the winter, flood management actions would need to
> be taken as well. Safety for the areas adjacent to the IJsselmeer can
> be achieved by either raising the water level in correspondence
> with the sea level, so the excess water can be drained under gravity
> into the Waddensea (of course, dikes need to be raised accordingly
> as well), or by building large pumps for discharging water into the
> Waddensea. If the first action is chosen, the extra amount of water
> can be used in times of drought. If the second action is chosen,
> water inlets and shipping sluices need to be adapted for enabling
> water use during drought. Table 2 provides an overview of this set
> of actions.
> 4.3. Step 4: assess efficacy, sell-by date of actions, and reassess
> vulnerabilities and opportunities
> Table 2 presents an assessment of the efficacy of each individual
> action and its sell-by date based upon expert knowledge, previous
> studies on possible actions, and preliminary modeling results for
> 2050 and 2100 indicating how much water (in cm IJsselmeer lake
> level) is needed to supply the amount of water demanded for an
> average, dry, and extremely dry year for the different scenarios
> (Klijn et al., 2011). For determining the sell-by date, we assume a
> linear change of climate and socio-economic developments. For
> the actions focusing on reducing the water demand, no model
> results were available. Together with stakeholders (water boards)
> the impact of these actions was translated into the amount of
> IJsselmeer water needed. Table 2 shows that the current plan is
> likely to be sufficient for achieving objectives for approximately 30
> years. After this point, changes are likely to be needed. Improvements that can be made to the current system should enable the
> sell-by date to be extended by approximately 10 years.
> The flood management actions and the actions for fresh water
> supply influence each other. A higher water level for increasing
> storage capacity will, at the same time, allow the system to
> discharge under gravity (depending on the sea level). If policymakers were to decide to ensure safety against flooding by
> increasing the pump capacity and keeping the same target water
> level, fresh water supply actions with an increase of the water level
> would be screened out. There is also a relation between the actions
> in the IJsselmeer area and other regions in the lower Rhine Delta.
> For example, as part of the actions to ensure safety along the Waal
> and Nederrijn, more Rhine water could be distributed to the IJssel.

> 5. Evaluation of the method
> In this paper, we have presented an approach for supporting
> decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes,
> called Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. This approach assists in
> designing dynamic adaptive plans, and is built upon the best
> features of two existing adaptation methods. From the concept of
> Adaptive Policymaking we used the ideas of (1) thinking
> beforehand of ways a plan might fail and designing actions to
> guard against such failures, (2) preparing for actions that might be
> triggered later, in order to keep a plan on track to meeting its
> objectives, and (3) implementing a monitoring system to identify
> when such actions should be triggered. From Adaptation Pathways,
> we used the idea of an Adaptation Pathways map, which visualizes
> sequences of possible actions through time, and includes
> uncertainties concerning societal values through perspectives.
> The map is enriched with triggers from Adaptive Policymaking,
> which indicate when each new action should come into force.
> We illustrated the integrated approach by applying it to a case
> inspired by a real strategy development project to prepare the
> Dutch water system for future climate change taking into account
> socio-economic developments. By applying our approach to a real
> world case, we have learned about the strengths and weaknesses of
> the approach, which we elaborate in this section.
> A strength of the method is that it stimulates planners to
> include adaptation over time in their plans – to explicitly think
> about actions that may need to be taken now to keep options open,

> comprehensive map as background information. The case presented here has served as an inspiration for the Dutch Delta
> Programme, and is included in their implementation guide for
> ‘adaptive delta management’ (van Rhee, 2012). Currently, adaptation pathways are being developed for fresh water supply and
> flood risk management. New model results show that with the
> pathways presented here, an acceptable water shortage may occur
> once in 100 years, and that for a target of once in 10 years the sellby dates are further away (e.g. current plan may be sufficient for
> achieving objectives for approximately 50 years if the target is
> sufficient water for once in 10 years).
> The moment of an adaptation tipping point (the sell-by date)
> helps in identifying possible paths. However, most actions cannot
> be implemented immediately at their sell-by date. For those, we
> need to include a lead time. The thinking behind triggers helps in

> difficult to detect, especially changes in extremes, due to large
> natural variability compared to the magnitude of change (see e.g.
> Diermanse et al., 2010; Hallegatte, 2009; Pielke, 2012). For
> example, water managers would like to know if climate change
> is happening because of the potential increase of floods and
> droughts. However, measuring (for example) peak discharges as a
> sign that climate change is happening is very difficult, because of
> high natural variability and the short time period of measurements
> (Diermanse et al., 2010). Still, land use, population changes, and sea
> level rise are gradual developments that are easier to detect.
> With respect to decisionmaking, Adaptation Pathways provide

> decisionmaking on short-term actions, while keeping options open

> This can be used to select a set of preferred pathways. Potential

> To determine the success of actions and pathways, quantitative

> A worthwhile elaboration on the approach presented here would
> be the evaluation of pathways with, e.g. a cost–benefit analysis or a
> multi-criteria analysis.
> The visualization of the pathways is seen as attractive by
> policymakers. This way of visualizing works best if the objectives
> can be summarized in a single main objective, such as ‘fresh water
> supply for different sectors’ or ‘safety against flooding’. In our case,
> we considered two main objectives that influenced each other.
> Because the flood management actions did not vary a lot, the
> relation between the two sets of actions could be easily described.
> In the Dutch Delta Programme the situation is more complex due
> to planning for different areas that have different pathways that
> influence each other.
> The use of perspectives is an element that has previously
> received little attention in the planning literature. We used
> different perspectives (or visions) of the different stakeholders to
> identify alternative preferred pathways and socially robust actions
> (Offermans et al., 2008, 2011). Different stakeholders may support
> different plans, but they can also have different reasons to support
> the same plan. For example, allocating ‘room for a river’ may be
> preferred by some because it enhances nature and lowers water
> levels in the case of peak discharges, while others may prefer this
> action solely because it lowers the flood risk. Development of
> pathways using stakeholder participation (decisionmakers and
> stakeholders) has been explored in a game setting (Valkering et al.,
> 2012). In this way, uncertainties arising from decisionmaking, and
> preferences among plans arising from different perspectives, can
> be further explored.
> The analytical basis of the approach (e.g. for determining sell-by
> dates and developing pathways) can be supported with computational scenario-based approaches. Making the necessary runs in a
> reasonable amount of time requires a policy model that is fast and
> simple, but accurate enough to simulate the relevant transient

> Currently, there is no such model of the lower Rhine Delta.
> Therefore, we assessed the effectiveness and sell-by dates of the

> 6. Concluding remarks
> In light of the deep uncertainties decisionmakers are facing
> nowadays, a new planning approach is needed that results in plans
> that perform satisfactorily under a wide variety of futures and can
> be adapted over time to (unforeseen) future conditions. Various
> techniques are available (e.g. Robust Decision Making, Real
> Options Analysis, decision trees, roadmaps, and several policy
> planning approaches) that have been or are being applied for
> supporting planning under deep uncertainty (e.g. in the Thames
> Estuary in the UK, the Rhine-Meuse delta in the Netherlands, and
> New York City and the Port of Los Angeles in the USA). We have
> used two complementary approaches for planning under deep
> uncertainty — Adaptive Policymaking and Adaptation Pathways —
> to develop an integrated approach based on the strong features of
> each of them. This approach, called Dynamic Adaptive Policy
> Pathways, results in an adaptive plan that is able to deal with
> changing (unforeseen) conditions.
> Key principles of the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways
> approach are: the use of transient scenarios representing a variety
> of relevant uncertainties and their development over time;
> anticipating and corrective actions to handle vulnerabilities and
> opportunities; several Adaptation Pathways describing sequences
> of promising actions; and a monitoring system with related actions
> to keep the plan on the track of a preferred pathway. The approach
> supports the exploration of a wide variety of relevant uncertainties
> in a dynamic way, connects short-term targets and long-term
> goals, and identifies short-term actions while keeping options
> open for the future. There is evidence that such policies are
> efficacious (Kwakkel et al., 2012) and cost-beneficial (Yzer et al.,
> submitted). In the end, all this has to fit into a political process,
> which has always been a real source of ‘deep uncertainty’. Political
> circumstances can give a window of opportunity (or not) to
> implement the designed adaptive plan. Also, the adaptive plan
> could be used to create the right political circumstances, for
> example by showing potential lock-ins, potential adverse impacts,
> and for how long a decision can be postponed. The Perspectives
> method could be used to frame the plan for different societal
> perspectives (as illustrated by Offermans et al., 2008).
> In this paper, we have illustrated and tested the approach using
> a virtual world inspired by a real world decision problem currently
> faced by the Dutch National Government in the Delta Programme.
> We were able to apply the method, and this result was received
> with great interest by policymakers of the Dutch Delta Programme.
> The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further use and test the
> approach for a real quantitative case study, other policy domains,
> and other countries.

> The idea is that people will represent different interests (shipping, water needs)-- maybe we give each person a mix of 1 - 5 of those (5 including costs). (I have 8 students.) Then they will vote on actions at each point in time. Each period (representing 10 years), there will be some stochastic realization which they may or may not have adaptated to. And see who wins and loses. My goal is to introduce them to robust decision-making.

> Can you translate the paper into a set of materials that I can share with the students? First, what kinds of materials might I need?
**assistant**:
> That sounds like an engaging way to teach about robust decision-making! To translate the paper into a class activity, you'll need to prepare a few sets of materials to help guide the students and facilitate the activity. Here's a list of materials you might consider creating:
> 
> 1. **Introduction Brief:** 
>    - A document summarizing the main concepts from the paper, such as deep uncertainty, dynamic adaptive policy pathways, adaptive policymaking, adaptation pathways, and the importance of robust decision-making. This should provide background information to help students understand the context.
> 
> 2. **Role Descriptions:**
>    - Details for each stakeholder group: shipping, water needs (agriculture, households, industry), environmental concerns, flood management, and cost considerations. Include each group's priorities, constraints, and objectives in relation to water management and climate adaptation.
> 
> 3. **Decision-Making Framework:**
>    - A flowchart or decision tree that outlines the potential pathways and decision points over the simulated periods. This will show how different actions can be taken based on evolving scenarios and outcomes.
> 
> 4. **Stochastic Event Cards:**
>    - A set of cards representing different stochastic realizations (e.g., drought, new policy regulation, economic shifts) that could occur each "period" (every 10 years). This will introduce uncertainty and test the robustness of chosen plans.
> 
> 5. **Simulation Timeline:**
>    - A timeline showing the periods (e.g., 0 to 50 years) over which the simulation will run. Markers for key decision points where votes will happen can be helpful.
> 
> 6. **Voting Ballots:**
>    - Provide each student with voting ballots where they can cast their decisions on the actions to take at each decision point. This can be tracked to see how consensus or disagreement evolves.
> 
> 7. **Scorecard:**
>    - A scorecard for each group that allows them to track outcomes relevant to their interests and measure success, challenges, and compromises throughout the activity.
> 
> 8. **Facilitator's Guide:**
>    - A guide for you with step-by-step instructions on how to run the activity, including how to introduce the simulation, manage the decision-making process, and lead the debrief.
> 
> 9. **Debrief and Reflection Questions:**
>    - A set of questions to help students reflect on the activity, such as how they approached decision-making under uncertainty, what strategies they found most or least effective, and how stakeholder negotiations played out.
> 
> Together, these materials will provide a comprehensive toolkit for successfully running your class activity and ensuring students gain a hands-on understanding of robust decision-making in dynamic and uncertain contexts. Let me know if you'd like help creating any of these materials in more detail!

> ### Understanding Deep Uncertainty and Adaptive Planning
> 
> In today's world, decision-makers must navigate a landscape characterized by deep uncertainties. Factors such as climate change, technological advancements, population shifts, and economic developments introduce complexities that traditional static plans cannot adequately address. Policies that rely on "most likely" future scenarios often fail when unpredictability disrupts those assumptions.
> 
> ### Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP)
> 
> The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach offers a framework for decision-making in this unpredictable environment. It combines principles from two methodologies: **Adaptive Policymaking** and **Adaptation Pathways**. Together, they form a strategy that anticipates change and incorporates flexibility and robustness into planning.
> 
> - **Adaptive Policymaking** involves designing plans with built-in flexibility. Key components include:
>   - **Mitigating and Hedging Actions:** Reduce risks and spread uncertainties.
>   - **Signposts and Triggers:** Indicators and conditions that prompt policy adjustments.
>   - **Contingency Planning:** Prepare for unexpected developments with predefined responses.
> 
> - **Adaptation Pathways** is about exploring and sequencing potential actions over time:
>   - **Adaptation Tipping Points:** Points where current actions no longer meet objectives, necessitating new strategies.
>   - **Pathways Map:** A visual tool illustrating alternative routes and decision points over time, akin to a transportation network map.
> 
> ### Objectives of the Activity
> 
> In this class activity, you will assume roles representing different stakeholders in a water management scenario. You'll navigate the challenges of managing water resources in the face of deep uncertainties, such as climate change. Each stakeholder will have unique priorities, and you'll need to collaboratively decide on actions at various points in time.
> 
> ### Key Concepts You'll Explore
> 
> - **Robust Decision-Making:** Crafting decisions that perform well across a range of possible futures.
> - **Stakeholder Negotiation:** Balancing competing interests and coming to a consensus on adaptive actions.
> - **Scenario Planning and Uncertainty Management:** Using dynamic pathways to plan for multiple future scenarios.
> 
> ### Activity Gameplay
> 
> - **Periods and Events:** Over multiple simulated periods, you'll experience various stochastic events that may influence your plans.
> - **Decision Points:** At each predefined point in time, vote on actions you believe best manage uncertainties while considering your stakeholder's preferences.
> - **Outcomes and Reflection:** Observe the consequences of your decisions and reflect on the robustness of your strategies.
> 
> This activity will provide insights into the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty and the value of flexible, adaptive strategies. Let's explore what it takes to create robust plans for a future full of possibilities.
