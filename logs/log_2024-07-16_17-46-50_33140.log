> 11
> 00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:13.690
> Natalie Magdeburger: to deal with those complications that arise. What we have seen is that there is an increase in the number of events. We have seen also that there is
> 
> 12
> 00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:29.749
> Natalie Magdeburger: an increase in the number of what we would call sunny day events. So more tidal. Kind of components to them. Obviously any kind of storm that comes off of our coast.
> 
> 13
> 00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.920

> 
> 14
> 00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:41.760

> 15
> 00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:52.230
> Natalie Magdeburger: we haven't had the degree of flooding that we had in like a major event like Hurricane Sandy. You know, I think the big event that all of us still.
> 
> 16
> 00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.670
> Natalie Magdeburger: if we don't remember it, we certainly can communicate about it, which is the storm of 1962.
> 
> 17
> 00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:15.960
> Natalie Magdeburger: That really, you know, did a lot of damage flooding. You know those events have been occurring for a long time. I our town itself. When you go back into the history. You can see that it built and rebuilt several times along the shore
> 
> 18
> 00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:35.180
> Natalie Magdeburger: and with each storm that would come in and kind of wash away the villages or the little cottages, they would come back and redo it again. So again, it's it's nothing new to our history, but we are seeing more events, and we are seeing more what I would call, you know, sunny day events.
> 
> 19
> 00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.660
> Caitlin Wilson: yeah, where do you see those impacts happening?
> 
> 20
> 00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.414
> Natalie Magdeburger: So our the impacts that we see are primarily on the bayside community. So
> 
> 21
> 00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250
> Natalie Magdeburger: probably 80% of our town
> 
> 22
> 00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:05.860
> Natalie Magdeburger: close to 80 80% of our town is on the Bay side. So west of Route one we were a town. I guess that kind of was built out of marshland way back in the day.
> 
> 23
> 00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:18.730
> Natalie Magdeburger: We had 2 groups that came in and sort of developed our bayside community. One was Colonel Schultz. He was part of the National Guard, and he was, I believe, he was, an army corps of engineers. And so we have

> 
> 25
> 00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.089
> Natalie Magdeburger: series of canals and lagoons that you know he kind of
> 
> 26
> 00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.540
> Natalie Magdeburger: built to create. Fema can use the fill from the lagoons
> 
> 27
> 00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:58.189
> Natalie Magdeburger: to make building lots, and then the other part of our town, which was on the south side, was done by Madison Gray. His. His canals can be a little bit more meandering, so that that can rise to some issues with algae build up, and not as good a flushing but both of them sort of use the same matrix. So we're a lot of our

> Natalie Magdeburger: You know a lot. When we get a lot of rain. We're we. Our rainwater management system is to the bay. So when the bay is high and we get a lot of rain, then that makes the problem that much more compounded.

> 46
> 00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:37.830
> Natalie Magdeburger: flooding the Army Corps of Engineers has done a great job in creating a very useful and efficient dune system. So although you know, the homes that we have on the ocean front obviously are always subject to
> 
> 47
> 00:05:37.830 --> 00:06:02.620
> Natalie Magdeburger: concerns. We haven't had any dune breaches. We have sort of a a dual dune system where you've got sort of one dune, and then a little bit of a gully, and then a bigger dune, and that has worked, and our dunes are growing. So on the ocean side the Army Corps of engineers has done a great job, and I think you know, part of it is, you know, they're planning. Part of it is just the geography and the you know how our town
> 
> 48
> 00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.079
> Natalie Magdeburger: is, you know, sort of falls to the north of Ocean City. We we gather a lot of their sand
> 
> 49
> 00:06:09.443 --> 00:06:23.730
> Natalie Magdeburger: and and where it's located. So the ocean side is not. As concerning you know. Obviously, that's always at risk. We get a big hurricane. Then, you know, one of the 1st questions we're gonna be asking during the hurricane is, did our dune sold?
> 
> 50
> 00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:44.490
> Natalie Magdeburger: Is that one only has to go back and look at the pictures from the storm of 62, and see what happens. When that occurs. From what we're seeing now, without, you know, short of a major category. 3 or 4 hurricane, you know, hitting us. We're seeing nor'easters, particularly in the wintertime. That.
> 
> 51
> 00:06:44.540 --> 00:07:00.049
> Natalie Magdeburger: you know, on a weekly basis this this past winter. Great example that there are areas in town that on a weekly basis are underwater. Particularly during high tide events that coincide with the storm. So

> 52
> 00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:10.450

> 
> 54
> 00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:24.290
> Natalie Magdeburger: you know, our town has undergone many transformations, and it has, you know, transformed itself in the last 20 to 30 years. Most of the homes on the bayside community.
> 
> 55
> 00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:43.610
> Natalie Magdeburger: Are newer, you know, in that time zone, and they're higher. So there's not a lot of living quarters that are on that 1st floor. We still some of the old cottages that go back into the fifties in the early sixties, which would have been either at ground level, or, you know, 3 feet
> 
> 56
> 00:07:43.986 --> 00:08:08.520
> Natalie Magdeburger: so they potentially could still be at risk, or parts of them could be at risk. But most of our homes are on the bayside community now have been built up, you know my my house, you know. Be a good example. I had an older cottage, and we knocked it down and built a more full time residence. And my entire lower level is basically what I would call garage space.
> 
> 57
> 00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:37.829
> Natalie Magdeburger: So there isn't any. There's no bathrooms, there's no you know. It's it's garage wood shop, you know that kind of stuff. And then our living quarters are on the second and the 3rd floor of our property. We have a height limitation of 30 feet here in Fenwick, so we don't want our buildings to be higher than 30 feet. We have a 2 foot free board space that we allow for. So technically, they can go up to 32 feet.

> 00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:42.140

> 59
> 00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:52.475
> Natalie Magdeburger: on resiliency. And how do we combat it? How do we mitigate? You know this sort of ongoing event that we see. So we have.
> 
> 60
> 00:08:53.451 --> 00:09:11.440
> Natalie Magdeburger: we did a resiliency study. So we have updated exactly sort of where we're going to have problems. And when and over what period of time? We have recently put in for a Federal grant. That we're waiting to hear back from. We're we're getting, you know, fingers crossed. We're getting good

> 61
> 00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:28.690
> Natalie Magdeburger: feedback that it likely will be approved. That will give us some engineering recommendations specific to particular areas of town, you know. For instance, you need to raise your bulkheads, you know, to a certain point you may need to put a berm in
> 
> 62
> 00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:53.848
> Natalie Magdeburger: at certain points. You might wanna consider living shorelines. You might wanna consider doing away with boat ramps that you know are open and allow water to seep in. You may want to, you know, put in pumps at certain areas. And if so, you know, what do we do? Over what period of time? What is our highest priorities. We now know and can pinpoint exactly where in town we're going to have

> Natalie Magdeburger: 75% of our town, almost 80% of our town is thought to be underwater during a normal high tide event. So we've taken the step of being very proactive or as proactive as you can be in this environment. This engineering study that we hope to kick off
> 
> 65
> 00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:34.629

The other piece that I think would be really helpful. That is disappointing is to get the Army of Core of Engineers involved. We had the back base study that was going on

You know, we have some pipes. We started out way back in the day where they had ditches, and then they moved from ditches to pipes. So we have gone through, and we've put in valves in all of our pipes

You know, and this is where the water is supposed to be draining out if the tide comes up too high, then those same pipes that we use to drain our water become a conduit to put water on our streets. So we have put in valves, and

It's mitigated it somewhat. We go through, and we look at all of these pipes as frequently as we can, you know, just proactively. If we see backup on any particular area.

> **Introductory Script**
> 
> **CW:** There we go. And then just a quick confirmation, I did the consent. And you're okay with being recorded.
> 
> **Interviewee:** I am.
> 
> **CW:** Perfect.
> 
> **CW:** So I've talked to some people like further north up the coast. You're the first person I've gotten to talk to from Fenwick, or that far south down in Delaware. So can you talk to me a little bit about your position as mayor, and how you are seeing the risk of coastal flooding, and the impact on Fenwick in particular?
> 
> **Interviewee:** So we are a coastal community. We've got a rather long history of dealing with the curveballs that Mother Nature sends to us. So coastal flooding in and of itself is not new. It is something that when we choose to live here, we choose to deal with those complications that arise. What we have seen is an increase in the number of events and more "sunny day" events, primarily tidal. Obviously, any kind of storm that comes off of our coast—nor'easters, hurricanes, tropical storms—those are all events that we are very attuned to and react to.
> 
> We haven't had the degree of flooding that we had in a major event like Hurricane Sandy. I think the big event that all of us still remember or can communicate about is the storm of 1962. That really did a lot of damage. Flooding events have been occurring for a long time. Our town itself, when you go back into the history, has been built and rebuilt several times along the shore. With every storm that came in and washed away the villages or cottages, people would come back and redo it again.
> 
> So again, it's nothing new to our history, but we are seeing more events and more "sunny day" events.
> 
> **CW:** Where do you see those impacts happening?
> 
> **Interviewee:** The impacts that we see are primarily on the bayside community. Probably 80% of our town is on the bayside, west of Route 1. Our town sort of built out of marshland way back in the day. We had two groups that developed our bayside community. One was Colonel Schultz, part of the National Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers, and he created a very straight series of canals and lagoons. The south side of our town was done by Madison Gray, whose canals are more meandering, leading to some issues with algae buildup and less effective flushing.
> 
> Our community on the bayside is subject to both tidal surges and heavy rainfall. When it rains a lot, our rainwater management system feeds into the bay. So when the bay is high and it rains a lot, it compounds the problem.
> 
> **CW:** What do you see as the biggest area for concern within the town?
> 
> **Interviewee:** Economically, residentially, not just physically flooding, but one of our biggest concerns is the ability to safely get to and from our homes. The bayside community, which has the highest degree of flooding, is a major focus. The Army Corps of Engineers has done a great job on creating an efficient dune system on the ocean side. Although those homes are always subject to concerns, we've had no dune breaches, and our dunes are growing. However, we face problems on the bayside, which experiences more immediate and repetitive issues, especially during high tide events in nor'easters.
> 
> Our community has transformed in the last 20 to 30 years, with homes being built higher. Most homes have living quarters on the second and third floors with garage spaces below to withstand flooding better. We are focusing on resiliency, doing engineering studies, and applying for federal grants. We now have accurate predictions of where and when flooding will happen and are looking into solutions like raising bulkheads, creating berms, considering living shorelines, installing pumps, and employing other measures.
> 
> **CW:** How are you thinking and planning for the future of Fenwick?
> 
> **Interviewee:** Initially, we've focused on doing what we can with the knowledge we have. Many coastal communities lack good stormwater management systems, starting with ditches and later pipes. We've installed valves in all our stormwater pipes to prevent them from becoming conduits for floodwater during high tides. We've also taken proactive measures by checking these pipes regularly to mitigate backups. Our Public Works Department is small but committed, tackling issues like clearing obstructions from pipes.
> 
> We completed a resiliency study, and we're now working on a comprehensive GIS mapping system. We need to create a detailed account of our infrastructure to understand what we have and identify any changes needed. The next step is to get an engineering study to pinpoint specific actions, such as raising bulkheads or installing pumps, and advice on necessary ordinances and grant opportunities to implement these measures.
> 
> **CW:** Are you concerned about people moving into or out of the area due to flooding?
> 
> **Interviewee:** We haven't seen a significant number of people moving out due to flooding. However, if the situation worsens to a point where it becomes unmanageable, that could change. The number one economic driver is our coastal communities and the tourism dollars they generate. There are major concerns about the potential impact of wind farms. From the studies I've read, wind farms could negatively affect the marine environment, land values, tourism, and even safety due to interference with radar and sonar. We need a more regional approach to addressing these issues effectively.
> 
> **CW:** Just to clarify, you don't see major concerns with people being unwilling to move to the area due to flooding?
> 
> **Interviewee:** Not currently, but I worry about future prospects if substantial flooding increases or if wind farms negatively impact the area's attractiveness.

> **Demographic Questions**
> 
> **CW:** How would you describe your gender?
> 
> **Interviewee:** I'm female, although I might have some more testosterone than I care to talk about. But I'm still very much a female.
> 
> **CW:** And your race or ethnicity?
> 
> **Interviewee:** I am Caucasian. Irish, Scottish—I'm a mutt, as they would say. A good American mutt.

> **Closing Script**
> 
> **CW:** Thank you again for taking the time. I appreciate it.
> 
> **Interviewee:** Good luck! I hope your research goes well. What school are you with?
> 
> **CW:** The School of Marine Science and Policy. I'm a marine policy Ph.D. student.
> 
> **Interviewee:** Good luck with your studies. If you need anything else, let me know.
> 
> **CW:** Thank you. Bye!
> 
> **Interviewee:** Bye.
