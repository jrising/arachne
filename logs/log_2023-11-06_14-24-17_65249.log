> Humans have engaged in large-scale transformation of natural systems for millennia. Stone Age hunting technologies led to extinctions of large mammals; agricultural revolutions transformed forests into farmlands; pursuit of minerals has carved the earth’s surface; dams and reservoirs now manipu- late the flow of almost all rivers; and synthetic fertilizers now flood the nitrogen cycle. But among these transformations, the restructuring of the global carbon cycle and the accompanying alteration of the climate stands apart in its sheer scale, complexity, and economic significance. Essentially all humans that have ever lived contributed, in their own small ways, to reshaping this planetary-scale system. Thou- sands of years of forest clearance may have added hundreds of billions of tons of carbon to the atmosphere. In the industrial era, every home lit by a coal or natural gas-fired power plant and every petroleum-powered train, plane, and motor vehicle has contributed to the net accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The average human contributes about 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) every year (Le Quéré et al. 2018), about a quarter of which will remain in the atmosphere for well over a millennium (Archer et al. 2009).

> Those emissions of CO2, together with other greenhouse gases, distort the planet’s energy balance. In steady state, the sunlight that makes it to the Earth’s surface is absorbed and then re-radiated to space as an equal quantity of heat (tech- nically, infrared light). The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere blocks some of this re-radiation, redirecting energy back toward the Earth’s surface: about 27 trillion watts (0.05 watts per square meter) per 1 percent increase in atmo- spheric CO2 concentrations, equivalent to the energy of one Hiroshima-scale atomic bomb spread over the surface of the Earth every 2.3 seconds. The resulting climatic distortion affects not just temperatures around the world, but also where clouds form, when it floods, how cyclones move, and the volume of water in the ocean. Thus, while fossil-fueled human industriousness has raised unprecedented multi- tudes out of poverty, the scale of the climate change externality it has produced is similarly extraordinary.
> At least since Nordhaus’s (1977) presentation at an American Economic Asso- ciation annual meeting, the analysis and management of climate change has been recognized as an important economic problem, and a growing number of econ- omists are lending the world their expertise in understanding the problem and developing solutions. However, conversations with colleagues indicate to us that a general discomfort with physical sciences—a subject sometimes not studied since high school—prevents many economic minds from engaging more deeply with the problem of climate change.
> The goal of this article is to provide a brief introduction to the physical science of climate change, aimed towards economists. We begin by describing the physics that controls global climate, how scientists measure and model the climate system, and the magnitude of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide. We then summarize many of the climatic changes of interest to economists that have been documented and that are projected in the future. We conclude by highlighting some key areas in which economists are in a unique position to help climate science advance. An important message from this final section, which we believe is deeply underappreciated among economists and thus highlight here, is that all climate change forecasts rely heavily and directly on economic forecasts for the world. On timescales of a half-century or longer, the largest source of uncertainty in climate science is not physics, but economics (Hawkins and Sutton 2009).
> Basics of Climate Change Science
> For most economic and scientific purposes, climate can be defined as the joint probability distribution describing the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and freshwater systems (including ice). Each of these systems is itself an extraordinarily high-dimensional system, so it is appealing to work with summary statistics such as global mean surface temperature or temperature distributions for major cities. Indeed, global mean surface temperature is intimately tied to the fundamental physics of planetary energy balance that explain global warming. However, consumers of

> The idea that human activity could alter the climate has a long history, going back almost two centuries (for an overview, see Weart 2018). However, it took focused research during the second half of the 20th century to achieve the level of confidence we now possess that human activity is altering the climate (Stocker et al. 2013; US Global Change Research Program 2017). This confidence comes from many lines of evidence based on observations at Earth’s surface and throughout different layers of the atmosphere and oceans, geological reconstructions of histor- ical climates, and two centuries of physical theory. The null hypothesis that humans have had no influence on global climate is now easily rejected given available data (for example, Hegerl et al. 2007).
> Planetary Energy Balance and Greenhouse Gases
> Sunlight continuously enters our planet’s atmosphere from space. In order for the earth to maintain a stable surface temperature, this flow of incoming energy must be balanced by a flow of energy leaving the atmosphere. For the Earth, about 30 percent of incident sunlight is immediately reflected back out to space from the surface or from clouds. The remaining 70 percent is absorbed by the Earth’s surface and atmosphere, and must be balanced by the planet’s own emission of infrared radi- ation to space, which intensifies with higher temperatures. Without greenhouse gases, the equilibrium global mean surface temperature would be –18°C (about 0°F)1, fully determined by the Sun’s temperature, the Earth’s distance from the Sun, and the reflectivity (also known as “albedo”) of the Earth. If a larger flow of energy somehow were to reach the Earth’s surface—for example, if the Sun were to grow in bright- ness, or the Earth to decline in albedo—the planet would heat up until the additional outgoing flow of infrared radiation exactly offset this new source of energy.
> Greenhouse gases distort Earth’s energy balance because they are transparent to incoming visible and ultraviolet sunlight but absorb infrared radiation, hindering the return flow of this energy from the surface and the lower atmosphere into space. When a greenhouse gas molecule intercepts infrared radiation headed from the surface to space, the absorbed energy is re-emitted in all directions, sending some energy that might otherwise have escaped to space back down to the surface of the Earth. This causes the surface and lower atmosphere to warm, increasing their emission of infrared radiation slightly. Equilibrium is re-established when the intensified outgoing infrared radiation is sufficient to offset the trapping effects of the greenhouse gases.
> Because of the presence of greenhouse gases, the average height in the atmosphere from which infrared radiation can escape to space and contribute to balancing the planet’s energy budget is not the Earth’s surface; it is a level of the atmosphere known as the “effective radiating level.” At present, Earth’s effective
> 1 To convert any temperature change from Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by nine-fifths—so 2°C of warming is 2 × 9/5 = 3.6°F of warming. To convert a temperature in levels from Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by nine-fifths and then add 32—thus a day with level temperature of 30°C = 30 × 9/5 + 32 = 86°F.

> radiating level occurs at about 5.5 km altitude; on average, this level has the necessary temperature of about –18°C—the same that the Earth’s surface would have in the absence of greenhouse gases. The relationship between temperature and altitude in Earth’s lower atmosphere—on average about 6°C/km—makes the surface nearly 33°C (about 59°F) warmer than this level.
> When greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere, the first reaction is that the height of the effective radiating level moves upward. This temporarily leads to a decrease in the amount of radiation escaping from the Earth to space; but conservation of energy implies the surface and lower atmosphere must then warm up, so the higher (and originally cooler) effective radiating level would warm to the equilibrium temperature of –18°C. In the absence of additional feedbacks, doubling carbon dioxide concentrations would lead to the effective radiating level being about 200 meters higher, which in turn would lead to an equilibrium surface warming of about 1.2°C (Hansen et al. 1981).
> However, the warming surface and atmosphere trigger feedbacks, which change the shift in effective radiating level and surface temperature associated with a given change in greenhouse gas concentration. Estimates of equilibrium climate sensi- tivity (the long-term, equilibrium response to a doubling of CO2 concentrations) that include atmospheric and sea ice feedbacks are generally 2.0–4.5°C (3.6–8.1°F) (Collins, Knutti et al. 2013). The most important feedback involves water vapor: a warmer atmosphere is a more humid atmosphere, and water vapor is the most powerful natural absorber of longwave infrared radiation. Other important feed- backs involve sea ice (which reflects incoming solar energy), clouds (which can both trap heat and reflect incoming solar energy), and the response to warming of the ocean and land ecosystems (which drive most of the flow of CO2 out of the atmo- sphere and can also affect albedo).
> Because greenhouse gases alter the climate by changing the radiative proper- ties of the atmosphere, their influence is measured in units of “radiative forcing,” defined as the extent to which the human-generated stock of gas distorts the net flow of radiation into the atmosphere on average (incoming minus outgoing), relative to a preindustrial baseline. For example, a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations from the historical baseline of 278 parts per million to the current (as of 2018) level of 409 parts per million exerts about 2.1 W/m2 of radiative forcing. For reference, the energy from the sun reaching the top of Earth’s atmosphere is 342 W/m2, and central estimates of the equilibrium warming associated with a change in radiative forcing are about 0.8°C per W/m2; thus the equilibrium warming associated with the current level of CO2 forcing is about 1.6°C above the preindustrial baseline.
> Radiative forcing by greenhouse gas emissions does not translate immediately into surface warming, in part because the deep ocean takes centuries to warm and, through exchange of heat with the surface ocean, slows overall warming. Nonetheless, modeling experiments indicate that—because of the relative timescales over which the planet warms and CO2 is naturally removed from the atmosphere—most of the warming associated with a marginal emission of CO2 occurs within a couple decades and persists for millennia ( Joos et al. 2013). Thus, climatic changes experienced today are a result of both relatively recent emissions

> and also cumulative emissions during the past centuries of fossil fuel combustion and past millennia of deforestation.
> Establishing Baseline Climates
> Within climate science, paleoclimatology is a well-developed subfield that focuses on the reconstruction of historical climates, thus setting a baseline for explaining climate changes. For examples, gases trapped in air bubbles of ice contain infor- mation on atmospheric chemistry at the moment they froze (for example, Luthi et al. 2008); the width of tree rings reflect growing-season temperatures and rain- fall (for example, Jones et al. 2009); microscopic fossils in salt-marsh sediments reflect changes in salinity, and thus in local sea level (for example, Edwards and Horton 2000); and the relative abundance of different isotopes of oxygen in ocean sediments reflect the extent of “ice ages” because polar ice sheets lock up lighter isotopes, thereby restricting their supply to the deep ocean (for example, Cramer, Miller, Barrett, and Wright 2011). In some cases, physical data can be corroborated with observations in historical records, such as records of cyclone-caused shipwrecks maintained by insurers (Trouet, Harley, and Domínguez-Delmás 2016). While most proxies and historical observations are inherently local, spatio-temporal statistical methods and comparison to physical models can be used to estimate global mean values of quantities such as surface temperature and sea level from local data.
> Figure 1 presents reconstructions of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, global mean surface temperature, and global mean sea level over two different timescales. In the context of the last 11,600 years, known as the Holocene Epoch, the recent sharp jump in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is quite striking and is unequivo- cally explained by human-caused emissions (Luthi et al. 2008; MacFarling Meure et al. 2006). The higher-resolution, post-1958 observational record from Mauna Loa in Hawaii also reflects higher-frequency patterns of largely natural variability, like the seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability in the strength of the land and ocean carbon sink (Keeling et al. 2001). The Holocene temperature record reveals a long-term decline, caused by slow variations in Earth’s orbit, that began around 5,500 years ago (Marcott, Shakun, Clark, and Mix 2013).2 The post-1850 reconstruction from direct observations reveals that this decline was interrupted in the 20th century, by a rise totaling about 1.0°C from the late-19th to the early-21st century (Rohde et al. 2013). This rise, which is superimposed by a spectrum of
> 2 The exact timing of the Holocene decline is currently contested. Marsicek, Shuman, Bartlein, Shafer, and Brewer (2018) suggest that the global analysis underlying Figure 1 is seasonally biased and conceals a more complex pattern, at least in North America and Europe, where their analysis suggests that summer temperatures declined starting around 5,500 years ago, but that winter temperatures did not cool until about 2,000 years ago. Some other, very long term cycles include Milankovic ́ cycles, which are global periodic climate changes driven by variations in the orientation of Earth’s axis of rotation (19,000- and 23,000-year periods), the tilt of Earth’s axis of rotation (41,000-year periods), and the shape of Earth’s orbit around the Sun (roughly 100,000- and 400,000-year periods) (Berger 2012). Changes in incoming solar radiation caused by these cycles, amplified by natural feedbacks, serve as the pacemaker for ice ages over the last 2.6 million years.

> higher-frequency variability, some internal to the climate system and some driven by changes in forcing, is well-explained by the response to human-caused emissions. Sea level responds more sluggishly than temperature to changes in forcing, because both the oceans (which expand when they absorb heat) and ice sheets (which can shrink in response to warming temperature) are large systems with an ability to absorb tremendous quantities of heat while warming only modestly. The first half of the Holocene is characterized by relatively rapid sea-level rise, which

> ended with the final disappearance of Laurentide Ice Sheet in North America. This rise was a delayed response to about 5°C warming since the thermal nadir of the last ice age (about 21,000 years). The twentieth-century sea-level rise was the fastest in at least 2,800 years, and the last quarter-century was characterized by a rate about twice as fast as the 20th century average (Sweet, Horton, Kopp, LeGrande, and Romanou 2017).
> In general, a core challenge to determining whether humans are changing the climate is assessing whether systematic changes in the behavior of the climate system are explained or confounded by the sources of natural variation. As one example of such natural variation, El Niño–Southern Oscillation is the dominant pattern in the global climate at annual frequencies and has occasionally been studied by economists (for example, Hsiang and Meng 2015). Other longer-term ocean-related oscillations include the North Atlantic Oscillation, which varies on seasonal, annual, decadal, and centennial timescales (Hurrell 1995; Trouet, Scourse, and Raible 2012); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Mantua and Hare 2002); and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (Clement et al. 2015). Climate models form the basis for inference in this setting, seeking to separate a secular trend signal from these oscillating sources of noise.
> Climate Models
> Climate models mathematically represent physical understanding of the climate system. They fall along a hierarchy of complexity from simple models that capture key aspects of the longer-term, global-scale response to detailed, full-complexity Earth system models that provide greater insight into processes at finer temporal and spatial scales (Hayhoe et al. 2017).
> The simplest climate change models, called energy balance models, can simu- late millennia of global mean climate change in a single second on a laptop. These models are based on a budgeting of sunlight and thermal energy in the atmosphere, as well as the role of key feedbacks. Early pen-and-paper versions of such models date back to the work of Svante Arrhenius in the 1890s; by the 1960s, they had also been adapted to include a single spatial dimension representing the vertical struc- ture of the atmosphere, which allowed the models to describe vertical motions of air (Manabe and Strickler 1964).
> In the 1960s, the equations of fluid dynamics were incorporated to produce early atmospheric “general circulation models” that capture both the three-dimensional structure and dynamical evolution of the global atmosphere (for example, Manabe and Smagorinsky 1965). Later generations of models elaborated their representa- tion of the ocean, as well as of sea ice, land surfaces, and atmospheric chemistry. These general circulation models3 were the ancestors of today’s full-complexity Earth system models, which also endogenize vegetation dynamics and the carbon cycle. Full-complexity Earth system models represent the best tools available for simulating spatial patterns of the climate response, but they have several drawbacks.
> 3 As general circulation models evolved to include more than just the fluid dynamics of the ocean and the atmosphere, the acronym GCM was sometimes adapted to stand for “global climate model.”

> First, they are computationally expensive, taking several hours on a high-performance computing cluster just to simulate one year of climate. Second, although such models provide fairly high spatial resolution—with grid cells that are roughly 100 km along a side in the generation of models used in the Fifth Assess- ment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—this resolution may still be inadequate for capturing details relevant to many economic impacts. Third, detailed models may produce baseline climate projections that differ from observed historical patterns. To address these last two issues, the climate science community has developed post-processing techniques for bias-correction and spatial “downscaling,” thus increasing the spatial resolution of the final output. Such techniques include both statistical approaches (like using quantile regressions to mimic historical variability around the mean) and physical modeling approaches that embed higher-resolution regional climate models within boundary conditions set by a global model (as in Wood, Leung, Sridhar, and Lettenmaier 2004). In addi- tion, cutting-edge climate models are run at increasingly higher resolutions; some of the most recent models have resolutions below 50 km × 50 km, and in some cases can achieve local resolutions as high as 10 km × 10 km.
> Within the context of a single climate model simulation, uncertainty arises from the imperfect representation of physical processes—that is, from structural and parametric uncertainty—as well as from the imperfectly known initial conditions of a model run. As famously discovered by Lorenz (1963) in early numerical weather models, tiny errors in initial conditions can produce dramatically different fore- casts within the same model, chaotic behavior known colloquially as “the butterfly effect.” This endogenous chaotic behavior turns out to be more difficult to predict than global average conditions, which are tightly constrained by energy budgets. As a result, climate modeling teams usually run their model multiple times with perturbed initial conditions, creating a collection of results known as an initial-conditions ensemble. Individual realizations of the model are never interpreted as literal fore- casts; rather, the ensemble as a whole is thought to capture statistical properties of the climate system. Indeed, most climate scientists generally avoid the terms “forecast” and “prediction,” preferring instead the term “projection” to describe a simulation of future climate under an assumed emission scenario. Producing decadal projections with global climate models is a frontier research area, with one of the key challenges being aligning the internal variability of a climate model with the internal variability of the real climate (Meehl et al. 2009).
> Emissions of Radiative Pollutants
> Not all the greenhouse gases emitted by humans remain in the atmosphere today; a substantial fraction has been absorbed by carbon sinks on land (like plants and soil) and in the ocean (for example, by phytoplankton and chemical dissolu- tion). If all 1434 Gt of fossil CO2 emitted since 1750 had stayed in the atmosphere, the current atmospheric CO2 concentration would be about 475 ppm rather than the observed 409 ppm, even without considering emissions from deforestation.4

> However, cumulative emissions of CO2 are nonetheless a useful metric, as the CO2-caused warming is approximately proportional to cumulative emissions (Allen et al. 2009), with every trillion tons of CO2 causing about 0.2–0.7°C of warming.
> Table 1 presents the estimated cumulative emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels and cement production during 1751–2014, as well as the flow of emissions in 2014 (Boden, Marland, and Andres 2017). The United States is responsible for over one-fourth of historical emissions, followed by China (12 percent) and Russia (11 percent, including the former Soviet Union); together with Germany (6 percent) and the United Kingdom (5 percent), these five countries account for 60 percent of historical emissions. However, if one examines flows today rather than the stock of historical emissions, the picture is changing; China (30 percent) dominated emissions in 2014, followed by the United States (15 percent), India (7 percent), Russia (5 percent), and Japan (4 percent). Germany is the largest emitter in the European Union (2.1 percent), with the EU28 collectively ranking third in global CO2 emissions, responsible for about 10 percent (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2017). High national emissions reflect high carbon intensity per capita (per-capita emissions are 16.2 tonnes/year in the United States, 3.4 times the global average), high population levels (per capita emissions in India, the third-leading emitter, are about one-third the global average), or a mix of both factors (per-capita emissions in China are about 60 percent more than the global average).
> These metrics do not include CO2 emissions from deforestation, which are significant: Pongratz and Caldeira (2012) estimate that these accounted for about

> 230 gigatonnes of CO2 from 800–1850, and 425 gigatonnes of CO2 from 800–2006, compared to about 1,175 gigatonnes of CO2 from fossil fuels over this latter time period (Boden, Marland, and Andres 2017). At present, the ratio of fossil fuel to land use emissions is about 7.6 (Le Quéré et al. 2018).
> These metrics also do not include emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and other climate-altering pollutants. The climatic impact of an emission depends on both its radiative forcing of the molecules emitted and their lifetime in the atmosphere. For example, methane survives for only 12 years on average in the atmosphere before breaking down into CO2 and water, whereas a substantial frac- tion of emitted CO2 lasts for millennia. Thus, while methane has large radiative impact per molecule per year, the integrated lifetime impact of a marginal molecule of methane emissions is partially offset by its short lifetime.5 Blanco et al. (2014) provide a discussion of non-CO2 emissions.
> Emissions of particulate matter and aerosol precursors (like sulfur dioxide) also influence the radiative balance of the atmosphere. Both pollutants lead to the formation of aerosols—particles that are solid or liquid, not gases, but which are small enough to remain aloft in the atmosphere for substantial periods of time (days in the lower atmosphere; years in the stratosphere). Most aerosols reflect incoming sunlight, leading to surface cooling (negative radiative forcing), but some, notably black carbon, absorb solar energy and increase warming. Through their effects on cloud physics, aerosol emissions have complex regional consequences for precipita- tion that are distinct from the effects of greenhouse gases (Rosenfeld et al. 2008). Because the spatial distribution and net radiative effects of aerosols are difficult to monitor, and change more quickly than gases, the overall radiative impact of aero- sols is highly uncertain and remains an important open question in climate change science. The global average effective radiative forcing of aerosols is estimated to be between –1.9 and –0.1 W/m2—opposite in sign and between about 5 percent and 90 percent of the forcing from CO2 (Boucher et al. 2013).
> As one more level of complexity, coal combustion emits both CO2 and aerosol pollution, which leads to a tradeoff of timescales: burning less coal reduces partic- ulate matter and sulfur dioxide emissions which is directly beneficial to human health, but also leads to a short-term increase in warming due to the reduction in aerosol emissions, even though the long-term effect of reduced CO2 emissions is a substantial reduction in warming (Wigley 2011). Similarly, efforts to target reduc- tions in particulate pollution from coal power plants without tackling CO2 emissions will lead to climate warming (Westervelt et al. 2015).

> another. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) (Taylor, Stouffer, and Meehl 2012) is the largest comparative effort, and plays a major role in informing the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. To ensure that model outputs are comparable across groups, standardized emissions scenarios are used as inputs to all models. The latest effort, CMIP Phase 5 (CMIP5), used a range of emission scenarios, known as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), that exogenously prescribe the flow of human-caused emissions over the coming decades. These emissions scenarios, which begin in 2005, are labeled by the overall radiative forcing (in W/m2) that occurs in 2100 in each scenario. RCP 8.5 has the strongest forcing, with CO2 emissions nearly doubling from their current levels by 2050 and continuing to rise thereafter; RCP 4.5 has a moderate forcing, with CO2 emissions stabilizing at close to their current levels through the middle of the century and declining thereafter, reaching about 40% of their current levels by 2080; and RCP 2.6 has the weakest forcing, with CO2 emissions declining immediately, to less than a third of the current levels by 2050, and becoming net-negative during the 2080s. In RCP 8.5, atmospheric CO2 concentration climbs to 541 ppm by 2050 and 936 ppm by 2100; in RCP 4.5, to 487 ppm by 2050 and 538 ppm by 2100; and in RCP 2.6, to 443 by 2050, declining to 421 ppm by 2100. Below, when we discuss “high-”, “moderate-” and “low-” emissions scenarios, we are referring to RCP 8.5, 4.5, and 2.6, respectively.
> Observed and Projected Climate Changes in the Modern World
> In this section, we describe how historical changes in the climate are identified and attributed to human activity, as well as climate changes that are projected to occur. Interested readers should consult the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Stocker et al. 2013), USGCRP (2017), and the readings cited below for additional details.
> Detection and Attribution of Climate Change
> Over the last several decades, a core objective of climate science has been to detect changes in the climate and to determine whether these changes can be attrib- uted to human activity. Detection refers to the empirical problem of determining whether there has been an actual shift in the joint distribution of environmental variables that we refer to as the climate. Attribution refers to the inferential problem of assigning a cause to the observed changes (Bindoff et al. 2013). Attribution studies generally simulate what counterfactual climates would look like in the absence of human activity, altering the model parameters that describe human inputs to the climate. Thus, for example, human emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols might be eliminated in a model’s “control” simulation. If it is not possible, or sufficiently unlikely, that these human-free simulations can account for observed changes in the climate, then scientists attribute these changes to human activity.
> The scientific community is in broad and strong agreement that overall, human activity has already substantially altered the global climate and that continued changes should be expected as emissions of greenhouse gases continue (Stocker et al. 2013; USGCRP 2017). The vast majority of actively publishing researchers now acknowledge

> the strength of the evidence implicating a human-caused signal in climate change (Cook et al. 2016). The agreement in the scientific community has grown stronger over the last quarter century, reflected in the IPCC’s increasingly strong statements regarding the detection and attribution of global warming shown in Table 2. Some of the public confusion regarding the strength of scientific evidence appears to have been sown intentionally. For example, a textual analysis of ExxonMobil docu- ments from 1977–2014 indicates that internal documents generally acknowledged that climate change is real and human caused while public-facing documents did not (Supran and Oreskes 2017).
> Figure 2 (which is best viewed in the color version of this article available at the JEP website) shows some of the most important evidence in support of the conclusion that human emissions are causing global temperatures to rise. In the left panel, red [or upper light grey] bands indicate the range of global mean surface temperature simulated in 90 percent of climate models that exogenously impose observed human emissions. Blue [or lower light grey] bands indicate the analo- gous range for the same models but in a “control” simulation that imposes only natural forces. Observed temperatures, indicated by the black line, began to sepa- rate from the envelope of control simulations in the 1980s and now lie far outside this range. In contrast, observed temperatures are fully consistent with the range of temperatures simulated when human emissions are included. We note that this consistency extends not just to global mean surface temperature, but also to changes in stratospheric temperature and ocean heat content. Thus, it is extremely difficult to explain current temperatures in the absence of human activity. The

> Average Annual Global Mean Surface Temperature, Compared to Distributions of Climate Model Simulations
> Sources: Data comes from Jones, Stott, and Christidis (2013), Morice, Kennedy, Rayner, and Jones (2012), and Taylor, Stouffer, and Meehl (2012).
> Note: This graph is best viewed in color; the electronic version of this article available at the JEP website is in color. The heavy black line shows observed average annual global mean surface temperature. The red [or light grey] distributions are exogenously “treated” with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, while the blue [or light grey] distributions (shown only in the left panel) are “control” runs that only contain natural forcings. In the left panel, climate model distributions are from the Third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) published in 2007 and displayed until 2000, and CMIP5 published in 2013 and displayed until 2010. In the right panel, all climate model projections come from CMIP5 in the moderate emissions scenario (RCP 4.5). Temperatures shown are relative to the 1880–1900 average.
> gradually increasing confidence of the scientific community can be understood by noting the envelope of model results published in association with the 2007 IPCC report (displayed ending in simulation year 2000) were less cleanly separated than those published in association with the 2013 IPCC report (displayed ending in 2010), although the separation visible through 2000 was already reflected in the IPCC’s 2007 statement that temperatures were “very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations” (Table 2).
> It is now virtually certain (at least 99 percent probability) that the observed modern warming trend exceeds the bounds of natural variability (Bindoff et al. 2013). Furthermore, humans are likely (with at least 66 percent probability) respon- sible for 0.6°C–0.8°C of the observed 0.6°C of warming over 1951–2010. Values greater than 0.6°C are possible for the anthropogenic contribution because of the possibility that natural forcing and variability could otherwise impose a slightly negative baseline trend (for example, as a result of volcanic eruptions), a pattern which is visible in the control runs of Figure 2.

> Can you summarize this section?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! In this section, the reading discusses the detection and attribution of climate change caused by human activity. It highlights the consensus among scientists that human activity has significantly altered the global climate and will continue to do so as greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. The detection of climate change refers to determining whether there has been a shift in the climate, while attribution involves assigning a cause to the observed changes. The scientific community has become increasingly confident in attributing observed climate changes to human activity over the past few decades.
> 
> The reading also mentions the use of climate models to simulate climate patterns and project future changes. These models range in complexity, from simple energy balance models to full-complexity Earth system models. They aid in understanding how greenhouse gas emissions affect the climate and provide projections under various emissions scenarios.
> 
> Furthermore, the reading emphasizes the importance of emissions scenarios, such as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are used as inputs in climate models. These scenarios describe the flow of human-caused emissions and help compare model outputs across different research programs.
> 
> Overall, the evidence supports the conclusion that human emissions are causing global temperatures to rise. Observed temperatures are inconsistent with simulations that exclude human emissions but are consistent with those that include human emissions. This finding, along with other evidence, contributes to the consensus among scientists that human activity is the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.
