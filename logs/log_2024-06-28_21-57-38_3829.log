>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students

>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

> Dear Professor James Rising,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. My name is Adegboye Marvelous Funke, and I am interested in pursuing a Master’s in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware for Fall 2025. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Bowen University in Nigeria, where I graduated in 2011 with a CGPA of 3.35/5.0.

> Your research interests in the impacts of climate change, particularly through the integration of empirical estimates and integrated assessment models, as well as the modeling of social-environmental systems with a focus on complex systems, food and fisheries, and resource management, resonate strongly with my background and interests. At ABC Sanitation Solutions Limited, I manage health data related to medical waste, conduct risk assessments, and implement strategies to mitigate health risks. This role has provided me with a robust foundation in understanding the intersection of environmental and economic systems.
> 
> I am particularly drawn to your work on the economic and policy aspects of climate change and resource management. I believe my experience and skills can complement your research, and I am eager to explore potential collaboration opportunities and learn more about your ongoing projects.
> 
> I have attached my CV and transcript for your reference. Thank you for considering my inquiry. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this further.
