> Which of these women also possessed the uncommon grace and wisdom of, say, Martin Luther King, Jr.?

> All of the women mentioned in my previous response made significant contributions to history and possessed their own unique strengths and qualities. However, when it comes to comparing them to Martin Luther King Jr. specifically, it's difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison since they worked in different contexts and under different circumstances.
> 
> That being said, there are certainly women throughout history who have demonstrated similar qualities of grace and wisdom to King. Here are a few examples:
> 
> 1. Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) – Although Gandhi was a man, his philosophy of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience has been influential to many activists, including Martin Luther King Jr. Gandhi's approach to social change was grounded in his deep spiritual beliefs, and he emphasized the importance of compassion, humility, and self-discipline.
> 
> 2. Mother Teresa (1910–1997) – A Catholic nun and humanitarian who dedicated her life to serving the poor and sick. Mother Teresa embodied the qualities of compassion and selflessness that King also espoused, and her work inspired many people around the world.
> 
> 3. Aung San Suu Kyi (b. 1945) – A Burmese politician and human rights advocate who has faced persecution and imprisonment for her efforts to bring democracy and freedom to her country. Aung San Suu Kyi has shown remarkable courage and resilience in the face of adversity, and her commitment to nonviolent change echoes King's own beliefs.
> 
> These are just a few examples, but there are many other women throughout history who have demonstrated qualities of grace and wisdom that are comparable to Martin Luther King Jr.

> Who was the medieval woman scholar who outshined men in her time?
**assistant**:
> One example of a medieval woman scholar who outshined men in her time is Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179). She was a German Benedictine abbess, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including medicine, theology, music, and literature.
> 
> Hildegard's writings on natural medicine and healing were particularly influential in her time, and she is credited with developing a number of herbal remedies and nutritional therapies that are still used today. She also wrote extensively on theological and spiritual topics, and her works on the nature of the soul and the meaning of the universe have been widely studied and admired.
> 
> Hildegard's musical compositions are also noteworthy, as she was one of the few women composers of the medieval period whose music has survived to the present day. Her compositions were innovative and expressive, and she was known for her use of complex harmonies and vivid imagery.
> 
> Overall, Hildegard von Bingen was a remarkable woman whose contributions to medieval thought and culture have continued to influence scholars and artists to this day.
