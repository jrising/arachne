> I usually write on holiday cards something like, "Wishing you adventure in the new year" or "Hope the new year brings surprises", but with Trump elected president again, I feel like I should tone it down, or tone it perhaps laterally. What do you suggest?
**assistant**:
> Given the current political climate, it's understandable to want to adjust your holiday card message to convey hope and goodwill in a way that feels appropriate. Here are a few suggestions that maintain a positive yet considerate tone:
> 
> 1. "Wishing you peace and resilience in the coming year."
> 2. "May the new year bring you strength and inspiration."
> 3. "Hereâ€™s to a year filled with harmony and growth."
> 4. "Sending warm wishes for a joyful and balanced year ahead."
> 5. "May the coming year bring clarity and compassion to us all."
> 
> These messages offer a sense of calm and encouragement, which might feel more fitting in this context.
