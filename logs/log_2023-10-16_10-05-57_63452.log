>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)
>    which has a Marine track.
>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
>    or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
>    prospective students.
>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> I am a professional of environmental management at Ready Made Garments (RMG) from Bangladesh with an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science major and Development Studies minor.
> I am highly interested and planning to apply for the master of Environmental Science & Management at the University of Delaware.
> I am intrigued by your research on the economic impact of climate change and waterbody impact that are my research interest as well given my undergraduate thesis on "Lysozyme Produced from Duck Egg is Capable of Reducing Methane Emission from Ruminants" and published paper on "Nanomaterials as a sustainable choice for treating wastewater".
> Looking forward to hearing from you if there is any slot to discuss further/any research project/funding opportunity available for me to join the prestigious masters program at University of Delaware under your generous supervision.

**assistant**:
> Sure, based on the information in the email, it seems like Daina Maliat is interested in the Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program. I do not see specific questions aside from querying about available slots, research projects, and funding. Daina Maliat's background in environmental management and her previous research seem to be related to your area of research—climate change and waterbody impact. Although there is no mention of her being local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area or her having done schoolwork at the institutions you specified, she does show a strong interest in the ESM program, and her past work aligns with your research. 
> 
> Here's a response you can use:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Daina,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your research interests as well as your professional background in environmental management. Your undergraduate thesis and published paper show an intriguing exploration of economical and sustainable solutions to environmental issues.
> 
> It sounds like you would be a good candidate for the Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program at the University of Delaware. This program offers a comprehensive approach to environmental issues, and your ideas could fit well within the research we are conducting here, especially with some of my projects around the economic impacts of climate change and waterbody effects.
> 
> Please note however, that funding is always a constraint in our ability to admit students. Although there are some funding opportunities, the ESM program is generally unfunded for most students, and I recommend applying as early as possible in order to be taken into consideration for any available financial aid.
> 
> Your interest in my area of research is encouraging—if you decide to move forward and apply, mentioning my work and your related interests in your application’s statement of purpose could increase your chances of aligning with a project and funding.
