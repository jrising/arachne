> I am doing some programming work as part of a grant, and I want to put a pretty header at the top of each file. The programming is in Julia, and most of the files provide functions, but some are scripts. Can you suggest a header template?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a header template for your Julia files. This template provides space for basic information such as the file name, description, author, date, and any relevant notes.
> 
> ```julia
> ################################################################################
> # Filename: <your_filename_here>.jl
> # Description: <Short description of the file>
> #
> # Author: James Rising
> # Date: <Current Date>
> #
> # Grant: <Grant Name/Number>
> # Organization: <Your Organization>
> #
> # Notes:
> # - This file contains functions/scripts for <specific task/purpose>.
> # - <Any special notes or instructions>.
> #
> # Usage:
> # To use this <function/script>, call <function_name>(<params>) or
> # run the script with `julia <your_filename_here>.jl`.
> #
> ################################################################################
> 
> # Add your code here
> ```
> 
> You can fill in the placeholders (`<...>`) with the relevant details for each file. Here's an example of how it might look for a hypothetical file:
> 
> ```julia
> ################################################################################
> # Filename: data_processing.jl
> # Description: Functions for preprocessing and cleaning data.
> #
> # Author: James Rising
> # Date: 2024-07-26
> #
> # Grant: XYZ-123456
> # Organization: Your Research Lab
> #
> # Notes:
> # - This file contains functions for various data cleaning tasks.
> # - Make sure to call `initialize()` before using any data processing functions.
> #
> # Usage:
> # To use this function, call `clean_data(df)` where `df` is your DataFrame.
> #
> ################################################################################
> 
> # Add your code here
> ```
> 
> This header provides a professional look and ensures that anyone who reads the file can quickly understand its purpose and how to use it.
