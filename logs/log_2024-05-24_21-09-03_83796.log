> I am creating a smart news aggregator-- for my person use--, which will provide customized "memos" on the news. I think that a main feature of this should be a narrative discussion of something relevant, but I wonder if I should also have some bullet points-- what's going on right now, keep an eye out for, something like that. Can you provide a template for how this could look?
