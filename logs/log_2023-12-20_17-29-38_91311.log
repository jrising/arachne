> How can total allowable catch be distributed in a fishery, other than ITQs, and what are the proper names for these methods? Like, I think you can just distribute TAC to whoever catches things first-- what is that called?
**assistant**:
> Total Allowable Catch (TAC) can indeed be distributed through several methods other than Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs). Here are some of them:
> 
> 1. **Competitive/derby fishing**: This is the method you describe, where the TAC is distributed to whoever catches fish first. This "Olympic-style" fishery usually results in a "race for fish", and the fishing season ends when the total catch reaches the pre-set limit. It can lead to overinvestment in fishing capacity and limited potential for selectivity.
> 
> 2. **Limited Entry Licensing**: The fishery is open only to fishermen who have a license, limiting the number of vessels or operators participating in the fishery. This does not divide the total allowable catch among individuals but reduces the overall fishing effort by imposing entry restrictions.
> 
> 3. **Temporal/spatial controls**: This means dividing the fishery by seasons or area. Fishermen are assigned a particular place or time they can fish, which helps avoid the "race to fish". 
> 
> 4. **Effort controls**: Here, the TAC is allocated based on fishing effort, such as limiting the number of fishing days, the size of the fishing gear, or the horsepower of the vessel. It becomes indirect control over catch quantity.
> 
> 5. **Community quotas/fishing cooperatives**: The entirety or a portion of the Quota is allocated to a community or a group of fishers (cooperatives), and they internally decide its distribution.
> 
> Remember, every method has its potential merits and drawbacks, and their efficacy can depend on the specific characteristics of the fishery they're applied to.
