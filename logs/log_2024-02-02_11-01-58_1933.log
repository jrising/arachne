**user**:
> What is it called when you have multiple runs of a single GCM?
**assistant**:
> Multiple runs of a single Global Climate Model (GCM) are commonly referred to as "ensemble runs" or an "ensemble forecast". These multiple simulations are conducted with slightly different initial conditions to represent the inherent uncertainty in the initial state of the climate system. This variability in outcomes helps to inform uncertainty bounds for the model projections and assessments of likely scenarios.
