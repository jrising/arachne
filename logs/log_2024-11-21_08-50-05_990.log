> Stewardship approach to add into Asana and milestones to combine with Comms’s calendars 
> Quarterly: Development team (Johanna) to check in with board members individually to maintain personal connections and address any concerns or opportunities for collaboration.
> Bi-Annual: Organize in person meeting with board members and staff twice a year like the October 2024 time together in DC and another moment to gather key supporters and cultivate new donors.

> Week 1: Send out personalized thank you notes and reports highlighting key accomplishments from the previous year.
> Week 3: Schedule individual meetings with board members to discuss their goals and expectations for the upcoming year.
> April 2025:
> Week 2: Host a small appreciation event for board members and funders, either virtually or in person, to express gratitude for their support. This can also be a hub event, that we can get sponsored, and have a clear path for funding.

> June 2025:
> Week 3: Send out mid-year progress updates (some metrics/recent noteworthy report) and updates on specific programs or initiatives that board members and funders are particularly interested in.

> Week 3: Conduct the annual meeting to review achievements, financials, and future plans, and acknowledge the contributions of board members and funders.
> November 2025:
> Week 2: Follow up with personalized letters or calls to express thanks (around Thanksgiving?) to board members and funders for their continued support, as we did in 2024 with the Impact Report Roll out strategy 
> Week 4: Share end-of-year impact reports and financial updates, highlighting the collective impact of their contributions, plan for 100% board participation.
> Next steps: Johanna to put these goals into Asana and track alongside Comms calendars 
> 
> 
> Other ideas to integrate: 
> Parlor Meetings hosted by Board members at their homes
> Breakfast meetings in key cities (NYC, SF) with a group of local parens 
> General IMT newsletter; have a 1/4ly shout out/funder spotlight 
> Comms to copy edit a “stats and testimonials” for what we have achieved in the first half of the year
