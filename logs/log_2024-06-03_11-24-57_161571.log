These challenges are particularly pronounced for under-resourced community-centered buildings (e.g., community centers, schools, and affordable housing) who are at higher risk of default, loss of affordability, and unmanageable noncompliance fees. Simultaneously, local and state jurisdictions cite their own barriers to effective regulatory implementation such as insufficient funding, staffing, and expertise to provide adequate compliance support to owners and service providers.
**assistant**:
> "Despite the potential for U.S. building industry growth, there are significant challenges: understanding of building regulations and performance policies is limited, and finding knowledgeable service providers for regulatory requirement compliance is difficult. These issues are acutely felt by resource-poor community buildings like community centers, schools, and affordable housing, resulting in a risk of default, loss of affordability, and high noncompliance fees. At the same time, local and state jurisdictions identify limitations including inadequate funding, staff, and expertise to provide proper regulatory compliance support."

The funding from DOE will fill the nationwide gap to coordinate the network of Hubs and provide additional capacity and resources to support the specific, place-based needs of each Hub. The existing Hubs are staffed for long-term engagement and are already doing incredible work in their regions, but are limited by funding constraints. This funding would enable a next phase in critical support for their regions and provide capacity to the entire growing network of hubs to leverage each other’s resources and training created under this opportunity in the future.

IMT will provide technical assistance to support gaps in local expertise, translate lessons learned across the network and with jurisdiction partners, and leverage our expertise supporting the launch of six high-performance building hubs through the BPP. BE-Ex will lead development of training and infrastructure of delivery leveraging their experience delivering over 1,200 educational events and hosting a robust “BE-Ex Ed” educational database platform. The local Hubs and nonprofits will be responsible for adopting the core training for their local jurisdiction and delivering the local training and resources. 
> The BPP network already has established recurring meetings and would use those calls to coordinate across partners. The project team will also have shared folders for document sharing. IMT has extensive experience managing projects and teams in remote locations. IMT has well-established financial, reporting, and project management procedures and tools  and extensive experience in management and accounting of federal funding awards.
> The project needs to coordinate across a number of partners and ensure that any items developed are additive with existing resources and address community needs. The first stage of the project will establish working agreements between project partners to ensure that there is a shared understanding of project priorities and work. This work will also involve a landscape analysis of existing resources both from Hubs and from other local training providers. Through this analysis, the team will ensure that any planned resources add value in each location and address gaps in the existing resources and training. To address any potential partner conflicts,  IMT will establish a conflict resolution policy to address any partner or working group conflicts. 
> IMT will stay in constant communication with DOE about the project status and any upcoming challenges. This will ensure that the project stays on track and meets federal expectations while continuing to prioritize local needs and potentially changing conditions.

Through the Hubs, the goal is to empower building owners, construction and design professionals, energy service providers, and local contractors to successfully comply with existing policies and more widely default to high-performing buildings during construction and retrofit processes. 
> This project helps achieve this goal by identifying the current gaps in resources that are inhibiting  building owners, construction and design professionals, and local contractors from feeling confident about the policies and high-performance buildings. An ideal future state is sustained funding so that each Hub can continue to develop resources to support the market, and ensure net-zero construction and compliance with any policies for existing buildings.
> The barriers to the impact include the rapidly changing landscape of policies and ability to reach all needed building industry stakeholders. As governments continue to try to address building emissions, new policies and adjustments to policies are expected and could change resource needs. The commitment of each government will allow the team to mitigate this risk through continuous communication about government priorities and policy plans. Similarly, with a large building industry in each location, the Hubs have a steep task in reaching all stakeholders. The team will mitigate this risk by working with other local providers and continuing to adjust marketing plans to reach a wider audience.
