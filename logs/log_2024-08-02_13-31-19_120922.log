Their mission is driven by three strategic pillars: inclusive entrepreneurship, community wealth building, and equitable economic development, and is fulfilled by providing access to capital products and services, and capacity-building technical assistance to low- and moderate-income Black entrepreneurs. Virtually all of the participants served by CHCTDC are financially disadvantaged, including youth and adults who are unemployed or underemployed, receiving public assistance, experiencing housing insecurity and/or homelessness, or insufficiently educated/trained to secure living wage employment. CHCTDC’s Building Maintenance training course has prepared over # students over the last YEARS in the fundamentals of building maintenance, building maintenance systems, plumbing, carpentry, and electrical trades. CHCTDC’s work is fully committed to racial equity, with constituent statistics and outcomes. CHCTDC’s efforts will be led by Troy Shockley, Director of Human Capital Development of CHCTDC, who brings 38 years of experience in the field of workforce development, education, and direct services.

> CHCTDC and the Hub are partnering to create this experimental program because our unique skills and relationships combine two separate but complementary strengths: CHCTDC’s decades of experience training building maintenance job seekers and connections to the small business owner community and the Hub’s trusted position as a BEPS technical expert and connector for D.C.’s real estate owner and operator industry. These strengths position us to create a direct employment and contracting pipeline that will enhance the high-performing buildings ecosystem by connecting qualified job-seekers to small business owners looking for employees and connecting small business owners to building owners looking for businesses to upgrade their buildings.

> The Green Empowerment Grant is set to launch a groundbreaking 8-week building maintenance course designed to invigorate underdeveloped and under-resourced areas in Washington DC. This innovative program aims to transform participants into leaders in high-performance building standards. Participants will dive into an engaging hands-on curriculum where they’ll master crucial skills such as HVAC maintenance and repair, lighting retrofits, window replacements, glazing, painting, and drywall finishes to name a few, with some skills being accompanied with in-field training provided by featured local businesses eager to support their learning and some will have the opportunity to enter into a trade association program for further training. For those interested in front-office roles, we will also offer vital training in customer service, accounting, estimation, OSHA compliance, and team leadership. Additionally, the course will provide opportunities to earn esteemed green certifications like the LEED Associate Certification. We are dedicated to their success, offering essential wraparound support, including childcare, transportation aid, uniform provisions, and interactive weekly & monthly mental health check-ins, all enhanced by a stipend to encourage commitment from day one. While a high school diploma is preferred, we are excited to assist motivated individuals in earning their diploma through local GED programs. Together, these efforts aim to empower individuals, uplift communities, and drive sustainable growth in Washington DC's most underserved areas."

In FY 22-23, 53% of CHCTDC program participants received employment, 72% earned industry-recognized certifications and 82.8% made Educational Functioning Level Gains in Reading and Math, allowing them to apply for and obtain new forms of employment or start their own business.

Direct measurements, collected periodically over time, will include number of new jobs obtained, number of new certificates earned, increase in educational function level gains, employment type obtained (ex. Part-time, seasonal work versus a full-time, year-round position), and general income growth.

> Simultaneously, the Hub is dedicated to enhancing community wealth by supporting BEPS-related building upgrades that increase the financial value of Wards 5-8’s community building assets such as cooperative housing complexes, community centers, and houses of worship. Complying with BEPS can directly increase community wealth by increasing a building’s property value and fostering long term savings accumulation through cumulative energy bill savings. Indirectly, BEPS upgrades facilitate a host of public health benefits related to the neighborhood and built environment determinant of health such as air quality improvements, improving local plant ecosystems, and supporting the adoption of sustainable practices such as increased recycling rates and waste management. The Hub will measure these outcomes by analyzing BEPS compliance data.
>

> The Green EmPowerment Grant demonstration project is connecting CHCTDC’s experience in increasing economic mobility and the Hub’s experience in growing community wealth by seeding a new, expert labor pool of Ward 5-8 members who are qualified and well-positioned to complete high-performance building upgrades and then directly connecting that labor pool with building owners/operators with open contracts. By combining our expertise and networks, CHCTDC and the Hub are creating a complete building upgrade labor ecosystem that addresses both the supply (qualified building maintenance specialists) and demand (Wards 5-8 buildings that need BEPS upgrades) aspects of the citywide mandate to upgrade D.C’s buildings. In this way, the Green EmPowerment Grant uniquely addresses both the lack of economic stability and the neighborhood and built environment social determinants of health by increasing Wards 5-8 community members’ economic mobility and community wealth."
