> can you make this fit for the McNight funder" The Institute for Market Transformation Accelerates Building Performance Ordinances that Decrease Building Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Improve Quality of Life 
> 
> 
> In the United States, buildings account for more than 70% of electricity usage and 29% of gas consumption, contributing to roughly 35% of total greenhouse gas emissions. While government leaders widely understand the urgent need to upgrade building performance to secure a more sustainable future, many are overwhelmed and lack expertise to identify and implement policies that effectively address equitable building decarbonization. 
> 
> 
> The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), a non-partisan, national non-profit organization, meets this challenge by providing expert strategic and technical assistance for more than 70 cities and states to design and implement building performance policies. IMT is a national leader in championing specific climate change ordinances, such as Building Performance Standards (BPS), as one of the most powerful tools municipalities have to reduce carbon emissions at scale by requiring the active improvement of energy performance of buildings over time. 
> 
> 
> IMT has a unique opportunity to increase the scale of our impact by providing expert strategic and technical support to policy makers at a time when they are actively leveraging historic federal resources to advance climate action. By consistently supporting four municipalities to explore and design BPS and six municipalities to implement BPS or a similar building performance ordinance, and through our field research and resource dissemination, IMT will play a key role in preventing 15 million metric tons of CO2e emissions by 2040.
> 
> 
> The Institute for Market Transformation requests $200,000 over one year to resource this critical work. IMT will not spend any requested funds towards lobbying or drafting legislation. To accomplish our goals, IMT will pursue three connected strategies: 
> 
> 
> Conduct preliminary, non-partisan research and analysis to target building performance ordinance work and subsequent strategy
> IMT will conduct preliminary, non-partisan research and analysis to determine where interventions are most needed and how we can provide strategic and technical assistance to four municipalities in designing building performance ordinances. Our exact efforts will depend on the unique needs of the municipalities we support, but we anticipate completing the following activities: 
> Assisting four municipalities to conduct a full and fair evaluation of options to decarbonize their building sectors, including whether a building performance ordinance is the best path, and if so, how we can best support their unique needs. Work could include conducting meetings with sustainability offices or similar agencies, attending industry conferences, or researching municipalities’ policy landscapes and avenues for action. 
> Research strategies and best practices to accelerate the impact of building performance ordinances. This research could include an understanding of utility data access for BPS or creating alternative BPS compliance pathways for underperforming buildings. 
> Provide strategic and technical assistance to the National Building Performance Standard Coalition (47 state and local governments) and other municipalities to design and implement building performance ordinances
> IMT will support local governments and their nonprofit and industry partners by providing both deep-touch, personalized offerings and widely accessible resources that share a clear pathway towards successfully designing and implementing a BPS or related building performance ordinance. IMT’s technical and strategic assistance to municipalities pursuant to this project will only follow written requests for support. Our specific efforts will depend on the unique needs of the municipalities we support, but we anticipate completing the following activities: 
> Continue to staff and support the White House’s National Building Performance Standard Coalition. In joining the Coalition, member governments commit to inclusively designing and implementing building performance policies. Coalition members receive resources and curated support from IMT related to BPS, including technical analysis and localized policy implementation efforts. With IMT’s support, the Coalition’s six states and 41 localities could cumulatively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 676 million metric tons of CO2e by 2040, improving the quality of life of almost 90 million people.
> Provide individualized support with BPS implementation-focused government staffers of six municipalities to assist with solving specific challenges and share best practices. We will provide on-call, help-desk-like support to other municipalities at large. 
> Grow the Building Innovation Hub, an implementation hub that provides training, connections, and resources to Washington D.C. building stakeholders to increase their BPS compliance and support economic inclusion for minority contractors. After piloting offerings in the Building Innovation Hub, we will share best practices with the growing network of eight building performance hubs across the country.
> 
> 
> Broadly disseminate building performance model laws and complementary resources 
> IMT will broadly disseminate building performance model laws and complementary resources to our network of industry leaders. Our reach includes contacts in over 70 state and local governments, along with more than 4,000 newsletter subscribers and 4,500 Linkedin followers. IMT’s activities related to its model laws and resources will be determined by the need from the field, but we anticipate completing the following activities: 
> Promote our Building Performance Standard model law, benchmarking model law, utility data access model law, and BPS implementation guide and complementary policies and programs. Most jurisdictions now developing BPS use our model laws as a starting point to craft their own law. We look forward to continuing this trend in the year ahead. 
> Amplify our model laws through partnerships with organizations such as the Center for a New Energy Economy, the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, and the Urban Sustainability Directors Network  to share our work in newsletters and presentations.
> Create webinars, blog posts, and templates that guide jurisdictions on key topics relating to evaluating, designing, and implementing building performance ordinances while leveraging federal resources and minimizing duplication of efforts.
> 
> 
> Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to continuing to discuss a possible partnership to increase the impact of building performance ordinances, leading to a cumulative C02e savings of 15 million metric tons by 2040 across the country.
