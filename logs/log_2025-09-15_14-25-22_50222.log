> **The Problem**
> 
> In recent years, the world has witnessed an alarming increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. From devastating hurricanes and floods to prolonged droughts and wildfires, these events have wreaked havoc across the globe, affecting millions of lives and livelihoods. Such localised disasters can have far-reaching macroeconomic consequences, undermining national economic growth. According to the research by Jina and Hsiang, these catastrophic events can ripple through national economies, exacerbating poverty and inequality, while stalling development efforts.
> 
> Furthermore, a study by Rising (2023) estimates that low and lower-middle-income countries have been particularly hard hit, being approximately 8.3% [3 - 14%] poorer due to the impacts of climate change. These nations, often lacking in adequate resources to swiftly recover, face prolonged setbacks. Climate change doesn't just threaten current economic stability; it poses measurable risks to government finances by increasing public expenditures for disaster relief and recovery efforts, while simultaneously reducing revenue streams and potentially lowering sovereign credit ratings. This precarious fiscal situation highlights the urgent need for robust measures to mitigate these growing threats.
> 
> **The Solution**
> 
> Fortunately, there is a pathway to mitigate these risks: strategic investments in adaptation and resilience. By implementing adaptive measures, countries can significantly reduce the potential damages associated with climate change. Several National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) already illustrate innovative solutions being employed across different regions to bolster resilience. From infrastructure modifications to ecosystem-based approaches, these examples underscore that proactive adaptation is both feasible and effective.
> 
> Studies consistently demonstrate high rates of return on investments in adaptation, particularly in terms of risk reduction. Beyond reducing vulnerabilities, these investments frequently yield substantial co-benefits, such as support for economic development and provision of social and environmental advantages—a concept often termed the "triple dividend" of adaptation. Cross-country analyses reveal differential impacts between nations that have invested in large-scale adaptation efforts and those that have not, further emphasizing the crucial role of adaptation in charting a sustainable and resilient future.

> Here is the next section of the introduction, on what we do in this report:
> 
> 
> This report:
>  - Review & Synthesis: Conduct a comprehensive global review of existing literature to assess the economic costs of inaction and the benefits of adaptation investments. This review will focus on macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes at the national level, with quantitative evidence of impacts from across the globe. 
>  - Case Studies Development: Analyse the adaptation outcomes in countries like the UK, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh, focusing on success factors, financing mechanisms, and national-scale benefits. These will provide the central link between macroeconomic outcomes and government action. If possible, we hope to provide some comparative assessments of the differential economic outcomes of investing in, and failure to invest in, adaptation and resilience controlling for various factors. 
>  - Promote Evidence-Based Policy: Provide Finance Ministries with actionable insights for integrating adaptation into fiscal planning and strategies to communicate the economic advantages of adaptation, including its role in unlocking international funding and supporting national development objectives. 
>  - Our main value add will be to give an enhanced focus to the impacts of inaction for the public purse, real world case studies, and targeted guidance for Finance Ministries, who look after public financing worth over $30 trillion per annum globally. 
>  - Quantify the costs of inaction and the benefits of adaptation.
>  - Our focus is the national scale, across the globe.

> **What We Do in This Report**
> 
> This report undertakes a multifaceted approach to understanding the economic implications of climate change and the potential benefits of adaptation. Our objectives are structured around three core components:
> 
> 1. **Review & Synthesis**: We conduct a comprehensive global review of existing literature to assess the economic costs of inaction and the merits of adaptation investments. This extensive review focuses on macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes at the national level, aiming to aggregate quantitative evidence of impacts from diverse regions across the globe. By synthesizing these findings, we aim to paint a clear picture of the high costs associated with failing to adapt to climate change.
> 
> 2. **Case Studies Development**: Our analysis extends to the adaptation outcomes in specific countries, including the UK, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh. We will explore key success factors, financing mechanisms, and national-scale benefits associated with adaptation measures in these contexts. These case studies will serve as a vital link between macroeconomic outcomes and government action. If feasible, we aspire to provide comparative assessments highlighting the differential economic outcomes of investing in adaptation versus the consequences of inaction, while controlling for various sociopolitical and economic factors.
> 
> 3. **Promote Evidence-Based Policy**: This report aims to equip Finance Ministries with actionable insights to integrate adaptation into their fiscal planning. We will share strategies for effectively communicating the economic advantages of adaptation, including its critical role in unlocking international funding and aligning with national development objectives. Our primary value addition lies in emphasizing the impacts of inaction on public finances, supplemented by real-world case studies and targeted guidance tailored for Finance Ministries, which oversee public financing exceeding $30 trillion per annum globally.
> 
> In summary, we will quantify both the costs of inaction and the benefits of adaptation, with a deliberate focus on the national scale across various countries. Our findings will highlight the urgency of proactive adaptation strategies, underscoring their potential to strengthen economic resilience and support sustainable development in the face of climate change.

**user**:
> Hmm, I should have said that part of that text was from the proposal-- the "Review & Synthesis:", "Case Studies Development:", and "Promote Evidence-Based Policy:" bullet points. I don't think we should say it this way here. Yes, we should clarify our goal is review and synthesis, but I don't think we need to say "our objectives are" or talk about components. The case studies probably shouldn't be in here at all-- they're boxes in the report, but we don't have a huge amount of commonality to highlight here. And rather than talking about promoting evidenced-based policy, we should just clarify that MoFs and economic decision-makers are our primary audience.
> 
> Can you redo this, without the bolded labels, and thinking more about how we should communicate for a report introduction?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely! Here’s a revised version that aligns more closely with your specifications and focuses on communicating effectively for the report's introduction:
> 
> ---
> 
> This report aims to conduct a comprehensive global review and synthesis of existing literature to assess the economic costs of inaction versus the benefits of adaptation investments. By focusing on macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes at the national level, we will aggregate quantitative evidence of impacts from various regions, highlighting the critical importance of proactive measures in the fight against climate change.
> 
> Recognizing the need for actionable insights, this report targets Ministries of Finance and economic decision-makers as our primary audience. Our findings will emphasize the potential advantages of integrating adaptation strategies into fiscal planning, showcasing how these investments can safeguard public finances while simultaneously fulfilling national development objectives. Through a clear articulation of costs associated with inaction and the benefits of adaptation, we hope to provide compelling evidence that guides strategic decisions for a resilient economic future.

**user**:
> The report focuses on macroeconomic and fiscal risks. I want to provide people with a general understanding of what macroeconomic risks entails. Here are some of the variables of interest for the macroeconomic topics:
> 
> Macroeconomic impacts of interest:
> Primary indicators:
> GDP per capita growth rate (Kotz et al. 2024)
> GDP-equivalent welfare loss (Howard & Sterner 2017)
> 
> Secondary indicators:
> Total factor productivity (Letta & Tol 2018)
> Labour productivity (Rode et al. 2024)
> Capital depreciation and loss (Bakkensen & Barrage 2020)
> Interest rates (Mongelli et al. 2023)
> Inflation (Qi et al. 2025)
> Unemployment (Liu & Lin 2023)
> 
> Can you explain to readers the nature of macroeconomic risks, as we understand them?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here’s an explanation of the nature of macroeconomic risks, incorporating the variables of interest you’ve outlined:
> 
> ---
> 
> Macroeconomic risks encompass a range of potential economic disruptions that can adversely affect a country's overall economic health and stability. These risks arise from various internal and external factors, leading to significant impacts on growth, productivity, and societal welfare. Understanding these risks is crucial for policymakers and economic decision-makers, especially in the context of adapting to challenges such as climate change.
> 
> At the core of macroeconomic risks are primary indicators that serve as key metrics for assessing economic performance. The **GDP per capita growth rate**, as highlighted by Kotz et al. (2024), provides a clear view of an economy's health by measuring the average economic output per person. A decline in this indicator often signals stagnation or recession, underscoring the need for timely intervention.
> 
> Another vital measure is the **GDP-equivalent welfare loss**, which, according to Howard & Sterner (2017), quantifies the economic welfare implications of climate change and other stressors. This indicator reflects the potential reduction in societal well-being, linking economic outcomes directly to broader societal impacts.
> 
> In addition to these primary indicators, secondary measures enhance our understanding of macroeconomic risks by elucidating the underlying factors influencing economic performance. **Total factor productivity** (Letta & Tol 2018) and **labour productivity** (Rode et al. 2024) indicate how efficiently resources are utilized in producing goods and services. A decrease in productivity can signal future economic troubles, as it suggests that output is not keeping pace with inputs.
> 
> Moreover, factors such as **capital depreciation and loss** (Bakkensen & Barrage 2020), **interest rates** (Mongelli et al. 2023), **inflation** (Qi et al. 2025), and **unemployment** (Liu & Lin 2023) play critical roles in shaping economic stability. High inflation can erode purchasing power and savings, while elevated unemployment can lead to decreased consumer spending and lower overall economic demand. Similarly, changes in interest rates can affect borrowing costs and investment, influencing economic growth trajectories and public finance health.
> 
> Together, these indicators illustrate the interconnectedness of various economic variables and highlight the need for comprehensive monitoring and effective policy responses. As nations grapple with the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change and other global risks, a nuanced understanding of macroeconomic risks becomes essential for crafting strategies that foster resilience, promote sustainable growth, and protect societal well-being.

**user**:
> I want this to be shorter and clearer. Don't reference the particular papers, but mention these specific outcomes and why they come together to paint a macroeconomic picture.
**assistant**:
> Sure! Here’s a more concise and clear explanation of macroeconomic risks, focusing on the key outcomes you provided:
> 
> ---
> 
> Macroeconomic risks refer to the potential threats that can disrupt a country’s economic stability and growth. These risks are critical for understanding how various factors interact to affect overall economic health.
> 
> Key indicators such as GDP per capita growth rate and GDP-equivalent welfare loss serve as primary metrics for assessing economic performance and societal well-being. A decline in GDP per capita signals stagnation, while welfare loss quantifies the broader impacts of economic stressors, highlighting the relationship between economic health and quality of life.
> 
> In addition to these primary indicators, secondary measures like total factor productivity and labour productivity shed light on how effectively resources are used in production. High productivity levels indicate a robust economy, while declines suggest underlying problems.
> 
> Other important factors include capital depreciation, which affects investment capacity, as well as interest rates, inflation, and unemployment, all of which can significantly influence economic growth and public finances. Together, these indicators provide a comprehensive picture of macroeconomic risks, emphasizing the need for informed decision-making to foster resilience and promote sustainable development amid evolving challenges.

**user**:
> Good. Can you write up the same kind of discussion for fiscal risks? Here's the list of indicators of interest there:
> 
> Macro-fiscal impacts of interest:
> Primary indicators:
> Role of fiscal policy on growth (Catalano et al. 2020)
> Borrowing costs (Cevik & Tovar-Jalles 2020)
> 
> Secondary indicators:
> Credit ratings (Klusak et al. 2023)
> Public expenditure
> Public revenue
> Growth of sovereign debt
> Assets at risk from physical impacts
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here’s a concise discussion of fiscal risks, emphasizing the key indicators you provided:
> 
> ---
> 
> Fiscal risks encompass the potential challenges that can undermine a government’s financial stability and its ability to fund public services. Understanding these risks is essential for maintaining fiscal health and ensuring sustainable economic growth.
> 
> Primary indicators, such as the role of fiscal policy on growth and borrowing costs, are crucial for assessing a government’s financial dynamics. Effective fiscal policy can stimulate economic growth and enhance investment, while high borrowing costs can strain public finances and limit a government's ability to finance essential services or infrastructure projects.
> 
> In addition to these primary indicators, secondary measures such as credit ratings, public expenditure, public revenue, and the growth of sovereign debt provide a deeper understanding of fiscal conditions. Credit ratings reflect investor confidence and influence borrowing costs, while variations in public expenditure and revenue can indicate fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, the growth of sovereign debt can signal potential future challenges related to repayment and fiscal discipline.
> 
> It's also important to consider assets at risk from physical impacts, particularly in the context of climate change. Such risks can lead to unexpected expenditures or losses, further complicating a government’s fiscal landscape. Collectively, these indicators present a comprehensive view of fiscal risks, highlighting the importance of proactive management to ensure financial stability and support long-term development goals.
