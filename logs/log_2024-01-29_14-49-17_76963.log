**user**:
> In Overleaf, I am using natbib, and my references are in a file refs.bib. But somehow the citations stop working after a certain point in the document. I don't know why this would be. Any ideas?
**assistant**:
> It's hard to say definitively without seeing your LaTeX code, but the issue could be stemming from several sources. Below are some common problems and their solutions. 
> 
> 1. **Citations Out of Scope**: In LaTeX, `\bibliography{refs}` should be placed at the point where you want your bibliography to appear, typically at the end of your document. If you're trying to cite a reference after this point, the citation won't be recognized because it's out of scope.
> 
> 2. **Syntax Error**: A misplaced curly brace or an overlooked command argument can break the interpretation of the document by the compiler and cause such issues. You could check the section before the last successfully compiled citation for any syntax errors.
> 
> 3. **Reference errors**: Another possibility is that there's an error in one of your BibTeX entries in the `refs.bib` file that's causing the process to fail.
> 
> 4. **Compiling Method**: Ensure that you are using the correct sequence of compiling commands when using natbib. 
>      The correct sequence when using natbib is LaTeX > BibTeX > LaTeX > LaTeX. Overleaf should handle this automatically, but if there's an issue it might not be running all steps.
> 
> 5. **Package Conflict**: Sometimes specific LaTeX package combinations may have conflicts. If the section where the citations stop working has a new `\usepackage` declaration, it might be worth looking up potential incompatibilities.
> 
> To troubleshoot, try commenting out sections, packages, or particular entries in the `refs.bib` file with `%` to see when the problem disappears.
> 
> Please let me know if none of these solutions work or if I can provide additional guidance on how to explore them.
