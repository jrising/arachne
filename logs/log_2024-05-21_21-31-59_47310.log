> We are writing to invite you to participate in a virtual discussion on policy alignment as part of the Blue Skies Discussion Series on Challenging Social Protection Orthodoxies in the Context of Climate Change, convened by the Climate Change and Social Protection Research Initiative (CCASP) and financed by DFAT.   You may not be familiar with how the climate debate is developing in the social protection sector, but we very much hope that you will agree to participate in this session to share your thinking with the group and  help us to define options for the future agenda in the sector.

> The purpose of the overall discussion series is to explore the limits of some of the orthodoxies and conventions currently informing social protection governance, design and provision in low- and middle-income counties in the context of the radical changes in poverty that climate change is likely to engender in the coming decades. The discussion series aims to stimulate rethinking across five aspects of current social protection orthodoxy: i) rights, institutions and mandates; ii)  policy alignment; iii) programme design; iv) operational systems; and v) financing. 
> 
> The discussion series is intended to encourage reflection and dialogue among leading organisations working on different aspects of these challenges, and contribute to a strategic shift in ambition in response to the urgency of the emerging climate crisis. The discussions will help to test the state of play and the extent to which these agendas can be progressed by actors at the international, regional and national levels. In terms of outcomes, key insights from the series will be published and, we hope, will be used for agenda setting and informing priorities for social protection sector development, in a way that is commensurate with the enormity of the challenge.
> 
> The objective of this session on policy alignment is to bring together a small group of thought leaders currently working on different aspects of the issue in order to identify and discuss the key challenges, urgent priority areas and opportunities for strategic engagement to enable the sector to prepare for the  profound climate challenges ahead.
> 
> The discussion series is informed by research carried out for DFAT by the Climate Change and Social Protection Research Initiative (CCASP) over the last two years and builds on the findings of the 2023 study on the implications of climate change for future social protection needs ‘Rethinking Social Protection and Climate Change’.
> 
>  
> 
> We are very much hoping that you will be able to make the time to participate in this somewhat unusual exploratory meeting to share your own insights with a range of colleagues working on different aspects of the same challenges, and to contribute to a strategic rethinking of how social protection can respond to the profound social and economic disruption that we now know that climate change will create globally.  There is an urgency to this discussion, and we are keen to bring together those best positioned to take forward proactive thinking and planning before the challenges become overwhelming. 
> 
> Please find attached a brief background note that you may like to read before the discussion.  This provides context and highlights some of the key policy alignment challenges we have identified along with potential areas for discussion that will be the starting point for the workshop.
> 
> Please note that the session will not be recorded to allow space for candid conversations and exploration of the issue.  The goal of the discussion series is to inform advocacy, research and ongoing collaboration and dialogue among the community of actors engaging with these issues, in order to promote a strategic sectoral response to the crisis. The key insights emerging from the discussion will be anonymised and shared with the wider community in the form of a summary brief.
> 
> Kindly let us know if you are interested and available to participate in the session, so that we can share a calendar invitation with you.  While we have identified your work as being particularly relevant for this session, please do not hesitate to inform us if you are also interested in participating in other sessions.
