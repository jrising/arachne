> The potential environmental impacts of the construction, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind projects are important to consider in the siting of offshore wind turbines. Potential impacts include avian mortality and displacement, habitat displacement, acoustic impacts on marine mammals and sea turtles, disruption of migratory routes, and sensitive fish habitat disturbance, including impacts on endangered, threatened, and rare species. Data on the distribution and abundance of endangered, threatened, and protected species were compiled to evaluate the use of the marine environment by wildlife that may be affected by offshore wind development. Information on abundance, migration and residency, and extent of habitat can be analyzed for geographical overlap and the degree to which biologically significant impacts and dislocation of competing users may occur. From a scientific standpoint, biologically significant impacts can be considered to individuals or to populations. Impacts to individuals occur when the animalâ€™s ability to grow, survive, and reproduce is compromised, while population-level effects can affect the viability of the species (National Research Council, 2005). Here, it is logical to consider biologically significant impacts at the population level, as many activities in the ocean can impact individuals and not every biologically significant impact to an individual will necessarily trigger the preparation of an EIS (as opposed to an EA) under NEPA. Further, while wildlife protection laws regulate impacts to individuals, they focus management attention at the population level. For example, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) ensures that stocks, or interbreeding groups of the same species, remain above the optimal sustainable population (16 USC 1361 et seq.) The Endangered Species Act (ESA) likewise manages for species, subspecies or distinct population segments (16 USC
> 1532). Lastly, benefits from CO2 reductions resulting from decreased use of fossil fuels are generally thought of on a large scale, in which benefits to wildlife would be assessed on a population level rather than individual level. From a management perspective, it is important that we consider impacts to groups larger than the individual as we look towards long-term viability of each species.

> Bats
> The state of Delaware has seven known bat species spending a portion of their lives in the state. These species are little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus), Eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and Northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) (DNREC, 2012). The Northern long-eared bat has been petitioned for ESA listing. Biological studies at the University of Delaware coastal turbine in Lewes have identified Eastern red, hoary, big brown, tri-colored, and silver-haired bats in the vicinity of the turbine2 (J. Firestone, personal communication, 23 February 2012). Bats have been found to utilize offshore environments, although the extent of this is not well published (Pelletier, 2011, Sjollema, 2011). Published research has shown that bats are impacted by wind turbines on land (Kunz et al., 2007a; Kunz et al, 2007b; Arnett et al., 2010), such as fatality from collision and barotrauma, or bats can be indirectly impacted by disruption to habitat, food sources, breeding behavior, and alteration of the landscape (Kunz, 2007a). Fatalities at land-based wind turbine facilities seem to be correlated with discernible factors (Kunz et al., 2007a; Kunz et al., 2007b; Arnett et al., 2010). Thus it is likely that migratory bats that roost in foliage or trees are more susceptible to fatality (Arnett, 2008). In addition to seasonality, fatalities are related to storms, either directly before or after a storm front passes and at low wind speeds, under 6m/s (Arnett, 2008).
> Although bats are known to be impacted by land-based wind projects, very little is known about the effects of wind turbines on bats in the offshore environment. Limited research in the mid-Atlantic region has detected bats offshore of Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey, among other areas. The University of Maryland and Maryland Department of Natural Resources compiled data on the composition and abundance of bats offshore in the mid-Atlantic through opportunistic detections located aboard vessels (Sjollema, 2011). Bat detections were recorded out to 22 kilometers. A total of 166 detections were recorded over an 18-month period at an average of 8.67km from shore (Sjollema, 2011). The majority of sightings occurred from August through October, although year- round detections indicate that non-migratory bats might be utilizing the offshore environment as well (Sjollema, 2011). Furthermore, bat activity in the offshore environment is directly related to wind speed (Sjollema, 2011), with bat activity decreasing as wind speed, and hence, energy (MWh) and project revenues increase. Unfortunately, at the time of publication, coordinates of bat detections could not be obtained and therefore are not included in this report.
