> Debugging JavaScript errors on your phone can be a bit tricky compared to doing it on a desktop, but there are a few methods you can try to pinpoint the issue:
> 
> 1. **Enable Remote Debugging:**
>    - If you're using Chrome on your phone, you can connect it to your computer and use Chrome's DevTools for remote debugging.
>    - Connect your phone via USB and ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your Android device (found in Developer options).
>    - Open Chrome on your desktop and navigate to `chrome://inspect`. You should see your connected device here, along with any open tabs. Click "Inspect" next to the tab you want to debug on your phone.
> 
> 2. **Using Safari for IOS Devices:**
>    - If you have an iPhone, you can use Safari to debug mobile websites. Connect your iPhone to a Mac with a USB cable.
>    - Go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced and check "Show Develop menu in menu bar."
>    - On your iPhone, open "Settings" > Safari > Advanced and toggle "Web Inspector" to on.
>    - In Safari on your Mac, under the "Develop" menu, you’ll find the pages open on your iPhone. Select the page you're working on to view the JavaScript console and any errors.
> 
> 3. **Mobile Browser Console Apps:**
>    - There are apps available for both Android and iOS that allow you to view the console output. Search for "JavaScript console" or "Web debugging" in your app store.
>    - Tools like `Metarhia — DevTools` on Android or `Inspect` on iOS might fit your needs as they allow local debugging on your mobile device.
> 
> 4. **Add Console Logs:**
>    - Sometimes, simply inserting `console.log()` statements in your JavaScript code can help trace the issue.
>    - Log the output when selecting a voice or catching errors using `console.error()`. If you see the logs in the console, it confirms something is running, and you might see what's going wrong.
> 
> 5. **Check for Permissions or API Support:**
>    - Ensure that the browser on your phone supports the Web Speech API, which is required for speech synthesis. Not all browsers may support every feature.
>    - Permissions for using certain features might be different on mobile than on desktop due to security reasons.
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to determine whether there is a JavaScript error and potentially gather more information to address the issue. Let me know if you need further assistance!
