> What is the income elasticity of a policy cost?
**assistant**:
> The income elasticity of policy cost refers to the rate at which the cost of implementing a particular policy change with respect to changes in income. It's a measure used to understand how the burden of a policy shifts across different income brackets.
> 
> The formula for calculating income elasticity (E) is:
> 
> E = % change in quantity demanded (or cost) / % change in income
> 
> In this case, the quantity demanded would be replaced with policy cost. It is important to note that the relationship may not be straightforward, as policy costs do not necessarily rise and fall with income levels, and numerous other factors can come into play.
> 
> Positive income elasticity suggests that as income rises, the associated policy cost makes up less of a person's income; while negative income elasticity means that as income rises, the policy burden becomes disproportionately larger.
