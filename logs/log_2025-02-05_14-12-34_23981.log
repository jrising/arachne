**assistant**:
> The "string things" in oranges are called "vascular bundles." These bundles are part of the orange's infrastructure that transports nutrients and water throughout the fruit. They are composed of the xylem and phloem tissues, which are essential for the fruit's growth and development. These fibrous structures can sometimes be more noticeable depending on the variety and ripeness of the orange.
