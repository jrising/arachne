> Saheb Lohakare: I am writing to share with you my proposed research on next-generation integrated assessment modeling. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are widely used tools to explore the complex interactions between the economy, energy systems, and the environment, and to inform policy decisions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. My research aims to advance the current generation of IAMs by incorporating several key features. Firstly, I plan to incorporate more detailed representation of key sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and land use, which are important for understanding the potential impacts of climate change on food security and biodiversity. Secondly, I will explore the implications of different scenarios for technological change, including the potential for breakthroughs in renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and negative emissions technologies. Finally, I will assess the uncertainties associated with different model assumptions and explore how these uncertainties can be effectively communicated to decision-makers. my research will contribute to a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the complex dynamics that underlie climate change and inform policy decisions at the local, national, and international level. I believe that the insights gained from this research will be crucial in helping society to transition to a sustainable and resilient future.

> Syed Ahmad Hasan: Integrated assessment modeling (IAM) is an interdisciplinary approach used to evaluate the interactions between human and natural systems, and to explore potential policy interventions to address global challenges such as climate change, energy security, and sustainable development. As we confront increasing global challenges, such as climate change, it is becoming more important to develop advanced IAM tools to aid in decision-making and policy development. The proposed research on next generation integrated assessment modeling is important because it seeks to improve the accuracy and precision of current IAM tools. By integrating cutting-edge modeling techniques and incorporating new data sources, the proposed research aims to enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between social, economic, and environmental systems. The research will provide insights into the complexities of global systems and demonstrate how advanced modeling techniques can be used to support decision-making in complex, interconnected systems. This knowledge will be invaluable for myself to make a meaningful impact on global sustainability challenges in their future career.

> Rajas Surlikar: From my earliest years of dabbling in Science and Technology, I have been fascinated by both abstract theoretical models and their practical applications in various fields of science. In pursuit of striking this perfect balance, I have been persistently trying to expand my knowledge and gain an exposure in various avenues of science. To date, I have completed a foreign internship focused on non-linear modeling of cancer cell response. Currently, I am working as an NLP research intern, exploring the topic of detecting fake reviews through aspect-based sentiment analysis and knowledge graphs. These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills in quantitative processing and programming proficiency. While reading literature on IAMs, I was particularly intrigued by its ability to combine insights from a range of scientific disciplines and assess the potential impacts of diverse issues. To incorporate novel features in pre-existing PAGE model, it is crucial to address each of these features individually. As a result, I feel that the adopting a modular-based approach would enable us to develop next generation IAMs and make projections of future climate and social issues. I am really excited to work in this new avenue and make significant contributions to the frontier research problems.

His background suggests he has the ability to learn Julia and a strong aptitude for environmental economics.
> 
> These candidates have a strong motivation for working in climate policy, demonstrate clear communication, show potential for learning the Julia programming language, and exhibit aptitude for environmental economics.
**user**:
> The top candidate, Jagori Bandyopadhyay, is mainly interested in data science, while this is much more of a computational modeling project. While a data science background is not inappropriate, it does not provide a particularly strong basis. Does this change the ranking?
**assistant**:
> Considering that Jagori Bandyopadhyay's primary focus is on data science, which might not be the best match for a computational modeling project, I have re-evaluated the candidates' ranking as follows:
> 
> 1. Devanshi Joshi
> 2. Nisarg Bhavsar
> 3. Muskan Malik
> 4. Adnan Iqbal Kantroo
> 5. Tuhin Subhra De
> 6. Tarapure Sushant Prashant
> 7. Abhay Mittal
> 8. Siddhi Agrawal
> 9. Udit Jain
> 10. Jagori Bandyopadhyay (moved down due to a stronger focus on data science)
> 
> The top two candidates have a stronger connection to the computational modeling aspect:
> 
> 1. Devanshi Joshi: Devanshi has experience working on projects related to climate change economics, integrated assessment models, and the social cost of carbon. She also has experience with programming and is open to learning new languages, which indicates she could likely learn Julia.
> 
> 2. Nisarg Bhavsar: Nisarg demonstrates passion for climate change economics and policy. He has experience with programming languages, including R and Python, and working on integrated assessment models. His background suggests he has the ability to learn Julia and a strong aptitude for environmental economics.
> 
> This updated ranking emphasizes candidates with a more suitable background for computational modeling while considering other factors like motivation, ability to learn Julia, communication skills, and aptitude for environmental economics.
