> I would like some guidance on how to respond to the following prompt from a job application:
> "How have you demonstrated an ability to build systems and implement structure within the grantmaking function in your previous roles? Please describe how your views on solidarity philanthropy (or trust-based philanthropy) are incorporated into your systems-building practices and the impact these systems have had on the grantmaking function."
> 
> Specifically, what are they looking for w.r.t. structures within grantmaking, and what is solidarity philanthropy (or trust-based philanthropy)?
**assistant**:
> In the question, employers are looking for evidence that you have experience and skills in implementing structure and systems in the context of grantmaking. This involves design and enforcement of organized processes, allocation principles, tracking methods, and communication strategies. They might be looking for examples of forms you've created, IT solutions you've used, or guidelines you've structured to manage, track, monitor, and assess grants.
> 
> Solidarity Philanthropy, also known as Trust-Based Philanthropy, is a growing trend within the philanthropic sector. In this approach, funders actively cede power to the communities and organizations they support by trusting them to use the funds in the best way possible, without imposing unnecessary controls or requirements. The six principles of Trust-Based Philanthropy are:
> 
> 1. Offering multi-year, unrestricted funding: Grants are not restricted to specific projects or programs, and they are assured for a certain number of years, reducing the predictability problem for NGOs.
> 
> 2. Doing the homework: Instead of asking grantees to report extensively, funders take the responsibility to understand the grantees and their contexts.
> 
> 3. Simplifying applications and reporting: This helps lessen the administrative burden on grantees.
> 
> 4. Being transparent and responsive: Communicating openly, honestly, and promptly with grantees.
> 
> 5. Actively soliciting feedback: Inviting critiques and suggestions from grantees.
> 
> 6. Collaborating with other funders: To minimize the burden on grantees and to achieve collective impact.
> 
> So when you're asked to describe how you incorporate trust-based philanthropy into your systems-building practices, you would need to illustrate how the systems you've created are geared toward principles like simplifying processes, reducing administrative burden, ensuring transparency, and fostering long-term, sustainable support, in a manner that upholds the six principles mentioned above.
> 
> You would also need to describe the impacts your systems have had on the grantmaking function, such as improved efficiency, improved relations with grantees, increased grantee success, or more effective use of funds. 
> 
> Your response will need to strike a balance between showing your understanding and implementation of established systems, rules, and guidelines within the sector, and your willingness to innovate and adapt in order to better serve the philanthropic goals of trust and effectiveness.
