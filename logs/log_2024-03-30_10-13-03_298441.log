> I am running anova on an lm model in R. I expected the sum of the Sum Sq column to be approximately equal to the sum of squares of the dependent variable, under the law of total variance. But it's like 5% of that value, so I must be misunderstanding something. How do I find out how big the "interaction" effect is that would make the variable of the terms not equal to the variance of the total.
**assistant**:
> The problem is likely arising because you're focusing on the `Sum Sq` column in the `anova` output, which displays the sequential (or Type I) sum of squares. This approach splits the sum of squares by the order variables enter the model, which might not make much sense, particularly if your model contains interaction terms.
> 
> The reason behind the surprising contribution of interaction effect to the total variance could be one or both of the following:
> 
> 1. **Non-additivity of your model**: Interaction terms can complicate the interpretation of the variance explained by a model since the relationship between predictors and the outcome is not just additive. 
> 
> 2. **Order of entry into the model**: If the model's variables are correlated, the order in which they're entered into the model can influence how much variance each explains.
> 
> You might want to try using the `Anova` function from the `car` package instead. This function calculates Type II or Type III sums of squares, which adjust for other variables in the model, and thus might help you understand the marginal contribution of each term, including the interaction term, to the explained variance.
> 
> Here's how you could implement it:
> 
> ```r
> install.packages("car")
> library(car)
> m <- lm(y ~ x*z, data = mydata)
> Anova(m, type = "II")
> ```
> 
> In this output, `Sum Sq` gives the sum of squares explained by each term in the model, accounting for the other terms. The sum of these values should be more in line with expectations according to the law of total variance.
> 
> If you perform the analysis this way and the interaction value is still low, then your interaction term might not be explaining much additional variance in your outcome variable after accounting for the main effects of your predictors. It could also be the case that your outcome variable has substantial unexplained variance. 
> 
> Remember that a relatively small effect of an interaction term doesn't make it unimportant - if the interaction is statistically significant, it might still reveal important complexities in how your predictors relate to your outcome.
**user**:
> Even when I make a simple example, it doesn't work. I create y = 10 x + Normal(0, 1), where x is Uniform(0, 1). There are no interactions, so I expect sum(y^2) = sum((10 x)^2) + sum(resid^2). And it is so, with I calculate it by hand. But the Sum Sq column shows a different value than the one I get, so it doesn't add up.
**assistant**:
> In your simple example, where you have a linear model without interactions (y = 10*x + Normal(0, 1)), the total sum of squares should indeed equal the sum of squares explained by the predictor variable x plus the sum of squares of the residuals. However, the sequential (Type I) sum of squares displayed in the `anova` output might not match this expectation due to the order of entry of variables into the model.
> 
> When you fit a linear model in R, the `anova` function by default uses Type I sums of squares, which means that the sum of squares attributed to a variable can be influenced by the presence of other variables in the model and the order in which they are entered.
> 
> If you want to verify that the total sum of squares equals the sum of squares explained by x plus the sum of squares of the residuals, you can calculate this directly from your model as follows:
> 
> ```R
> # Simulate the data
> set.seed(123)
> x <- runif(100, 0, 1)
> y <- 10 * x + rnorm(100)
> 
> # Fit the linear model
> model <- lm(y ~ x)
> 
> # Extract sum of squares of x and residuals
> sum_sq_x <- sum((coef(model)["x"])^2 * var(x) * length(x))
> sum_sq_residuals <- sum(resid(model)^2)
> 
> # Total sum of squares
> total_sum_sq <- sum(y^2)
> 
> # Compare the calculated values with the ones in the ANOVA table
> sum_sq_x
> sum_sq_residuals
> total_sum_sq
> ```
> 
> By directly calculating the sum of squares explained by x and the sum of squares of residuals from the model, you should see that they add up to the total sum of squares of y, as expected in your simple example.
> 
> This can help you confirm that the discrepancy you observed in the `anova` output is due to the use of sequential sums of squares, and that in your model, the total sum of squares is correctly decomposed into the sum of squares explained by x and the sum of squares of residuals.
**user**:
> I don't see how the Type I issue can be an explanation. My model only has 1 variable. So, the Sum Sq column must be calculated differently. Any idea how?
**assistant**:
> If your model contains only one variable, and you're still observing a discrepancy between the total sum of squares and the sum of squares explained by that variable in the ANOVA output, then the issue is not related to the Type I sums of squares influenced by the order of entry of variables. In a simple linear regression model with one predictor, the total sum of squares should equal the sum of squares explained by the predictor plus the sum of squares of residuals.
> 
> In the context of a simple linear regression model with one predictor variable (x) and one outcome variable (y = 10 * x + Normal(0, 1)), fitting such a model should indeed result in the sum of squares explained by x being equal to the sum of squares of y.

> If you are experiencing a discrepancy between the total sum of squares and the sum of squares explained by x in the ANOVA output, it could be due to computational precision issues or how R is handling the calculations in the ANOVA table.
> 
> To confirm the issue, you could calculate these quantities directly as shown earlier and compare them to the values displayed in the ANOVA output. If the discrepancy persists, it might be worth double-checking the calculations and potentially seeking help from R experts or posting on forums like Stack Overflow for further assistance on understanding the source of the discrepancy in the ANOVA table for this particular case.
