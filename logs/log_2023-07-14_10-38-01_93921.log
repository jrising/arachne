> My garbage disposal won't run and the dishwasher-- which has a tube to the disposal-- is also clogged. I assume these are related. Is this something I can fix on my own?
**assistant**:
> Yes, James, you should be able to tackle this problem on your own, given that it's not too severe. Here's a step-by-step approach you can try:
> 
> 1. **Check the power:** Make sure the disposal is plugged in and the breaker hasnâ€™t tripped.
> 
> 2. **Press the reset button:** Garbage disposals have a red or black reset button on the bottom that can start the motor back up.
> 
> 3. **Check for obstructions:** Turn off the garbage disposal at the wall switch and unplug it, then look inside the device for foreign objects that may be causing it to jam. Use pliers or tongs to remove any obstructions -- never your hand.
> 
> 4. **Try to manually turn the blades:** If you could not find any visible obstructions, you could try moving the blades manually with a hex key from underneath the unit (this typically requires a 1/4" hex key). Once the blades can be moved slightly, switch on the power again and see if it starts up. 
> 
> 5. **Check the dishwasher hose:** If your garbage disposal is running but the dishwasher is still clogged, inspect the hose from your dishwasher to your disposal. It might be clogged. If so, detach it, clean it out, then re-attach it (turn off power during this step).
> 
> It's important to remember to be careful whenever dealing with electrical appliances and if the problem persists, call a professional. You don't want to risk damaging your appliances or being injured.
> 
> Relatedly, it's a good practice to keep your disposal blades sharp. You can do this by regularly grinding small pieces of ice and eggshells, which help clean the blades. Always run cold water when you're grinding to solidify any grease that may be present so it can be chopped and flushed through the system.
**user**:
> I don't feel any obstructions from the top. Should I need to remove the garbage disposal to check more thoroughly?
**assistant**:
> If you've checked for obstructions from the top and haven't found anything, it's possible that there may be something lodged in the garbage disposal that you can't see or feel. In this case, removing the garbage disposal for a more thorough inspection might be necessary.
> 
> Before proceeding with removing the garbage disposal, it's important to ensure that you have the necessary skills and tools for the task. If you're not comfortable with plumbing work or don't have the proper tools, it might be best to call a professional plumber to assist you.
> 
> However, if you're confident in your abilities, here's a general outline of the steps involved in removing a garbage disposal:
> 
> 1. **Turn off the power:** First, ensure that the power to the disposal is turned off by switching off the circuit breaker or unplugging it.
> 
> 2. **Disconnect the drainpipe:** Loosen the slip nuts on the drainpipe and disconnect it from both the garbage disposal and the sink drain.
> 
> 3. **Detach the garbage disposal:** Most garbage disposals are fastened to the mounting assembly under the sink with a mounting ring. You may need to use a screwdriver or a wrench to detach the disposal from the mounting assembly.
> 
> 4. **Inspect the interior:** Once the garbage disposal is removed, you can carefully inspect the interior for any obstructions. You may need to use a flashlight to get a good view. Take note of any foreign objects or debris that you may find.
> 
> 5. **Reassemble and test:** After inspecting and removing any obstructions, you can reassemble the garbage disposal in the reverse order. Make sure everything is securely fastened, then turn on the power and test the disposal to see if it's running properly.
> 
> Remember, if at any point you feel unsure or uncomfortable during the process, don't hesitate to call a professional plumber for assistance. It's better to be safe than risk causing further damage or injury.
**user**:
> My drain pipe goes from the garbage disposal into a metal fitting, and I don't see anything to turn to loosen the metal off of the plastic pipe. What should I do?
**assistant**:
> If your drain pipe goes from the garbage disposal into a metal fitting and you don't see any visible way to loosen it from the plastic pipe, it's possible that the connection is a bit more complex. In this case, it might be best to call a professional plumber to assist you.
> 
> However, if you're feeling confident and want to try one more step, you could attempt using a pipe wrench to loosen the metal fitting. 
> 
> Here's how you can give it a try:
> 
> 1. **Prepare the area:** Start by placing a bucket or a towel under the pipe connection to catch any water or debris that may come out.
> 
> 2. **Use a pipe wrench:** Take a pipe wrench or a pair of pliers and grip the metal fitting securely. Turn the fitting counterclockwise to attempt to loosen it. Be careful not to force it too hard or use excessive pressure, as this could cause damage.
> 
> 3. **Apply lubricant:** If the metal fitting seems stuck or resistant to turning, you could try applying a lubricant such as WD-40 to the connection. Let it sit for a few minutes to penetrate and then try loosening it again.
> 
> If, despite your best efforts, you're unable to loosen the metal fitting or if you encounter any difficulties during the process, it's recommended to call a professional plumber. They have the expertise and specialized tools to handle more complex plumbing situations and can ensure the job is done safely and correctly.
> 
> Remember that working with plumbing systems can be challenging, and it's important to prioritize your safety and the integrity of your plumbing system.
