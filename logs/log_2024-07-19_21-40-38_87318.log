**user**:
> I have a slider for setting a parameter "selected_rate" in Shiny and now I want to use it. But when I try to ask for input$selected_rate in server, I get the error:
> ```
> Warning: Error in $: Can't access reactive value 'selected_rate' outside of reactive consumer.
> ℹ Do you need to wrap inside reactive() or observe()?

**assistant**:
> In Shiny, reactive values like `input$selected_rate` need to be accessed within a reactive context, such as inside a `reactive()`, `observe()`, `observeEvent()`, or within the body of a render function (like `renderPlot()` or `renderTable()`).
> 
> Here’s a simple example to illustrate how you can access `input$selected_rate` correctly:
> 
> 1. **UI Definition**: Including a slider input for `selected_rate`.
> 2. **Server Function**: Using `observe()` to react to changes in `selected_rate`.
> 
> ### UI
> 
> ```r
> library(shiny)
> 
> ui <- fluidPage(
>     sliderInput("selected_rate", 
>                 "Select Rate:", 
>                 min = 0, 
>                 max = 100, 
>                 value = 50),
>     textOutput("rateDisplay")
> )
> ```
> 
> ### Server
> 
> ```r
> server <- function(input, output, session) {
>     observe({
>         # You can access input$selected_rate here
>         rate <- input$selected_rate
>         # Do something with the rate, for example, print it to console
>         print(rate)
>     })
>     
>     output$rateDisplay <- renderText({
>         # This will update whenever input$selected_rate changes
>         paste("Selected Rate:", input$selected_rate)
>     })
> }
> 
> shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation
> 
> - **`observe()`**: This creates a reactive context that will execute its body whenever any of the reactive inputs it depends on change. In this case, it prints the selected rate to the console whenever `input$selected_rate` changes.
> - **`output$rateDisplay <- renderText({ ... })`**: This creates a reactive output. It will automatically update the text output whenever `input$selected_rate` changes.
> 
> By using `observe()` or `renderText()`, you ensure that `input$selected_rate` is accessed within a reactive context. This avoids the error you were encountering.
