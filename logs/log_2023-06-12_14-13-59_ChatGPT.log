> What is a term for something that is not specifically distinguished. I have a variance decomposition, where I know some of the sources of variance, but then there is an additional component of the variance that I cannot specifically attribute to any of my sources (it is technically coming from their interaction).
**assistant**:
> In statistical analyses, including variance decomposition, the term often used for the component of variance that cannot be specifically attributed to any known sources is "residual variance". This is the unexplained variance, the amount of variance that is not accounted for by the model. In the case of your scenario, where it seems like this residual variance might be due to interaction between your known sources, you could possibly refer to it as "interaction variance" or "unexplained interaction variance".

**user**:
> Sometimes in a variance deposition, the total variance across components is greater than the total variance. This means that uncertainty from those components is destructively interacting, reducing the total variance. Sometimes this is shown with a negative bar on an graph, so the sum is 100%. But I don't think this is totally sensible-- just like with the case when components are less than the total variance and you add an "unexplained interaction variance", the decomposition should have all positive components. Is there a way to add a positive component to the decomposition in the case where the total variance is less, to denote how much of the variance we can't attribute to any given component?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the scenario you're describing is sometimes called "overlapping" or "shared" variance, when different sources in a variance decomposition are not completely independent, and their total combined variance exceeds the total variance of the data. When this happens, it's often a sign that the sources of variance are not fully distinct, but share some common elements, which can reduce the total variance. 
> 
> To ensure all components in the decomposition are positive, you could introduce a term to capture this overlapping variance. This would be a positive quantity equal to the amount by which the sum of the variances from the individual sources exceeds the total variance. You might refer to this as "overlapping variance" or "shared variance".
> 
> For example, if you have three sources of variance A, B, and C and their individual variances add up to more than the total variance T, you could introduce a new source D, called "shared variance", where D = (A + B + C) - T.

> This approach captures the intuition that when the total variance from the sources is greater than the total variance, it's because these sources share some common elements that are being double-counted in the total. By introducing a "shared variance" term, you ensure all components of the decomposition are positive, while still capturing the important fact that some of the variance is shared among the sources. This also allows you to retain a complete picture of the variance, without resorting to negative variance values.
**user**:
> In some cases, that will result in revised variances that are less than 0. Are these just shown as 0 in that case?
**assistant**:
> If the shared variance or overlapping variance (D) is calculated in such a way that it's larger than any individual component (A, B, or C), reducing that component by D would indeed result in a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context. 
> 
> If you encounter this situation, it suggests that the interaction or overlap between components is more complex than can be captured by a simple subtraction of a shared variance term. This may indicate that the sources of variance are not fully independent, and their interaction cannot be adequately captured by a linear model. 
> 
> One solution would be to model the interaction terms explicitly, for instance, by including terms for A*B, A*C, B*C, and possibly A*B*C, if all three sources can interact simultaneously. This allows for complex interactions where the effect of one source of variance depends on the level of another source.

> Alternatively, you could choose to clamp the revised variances at 0, essentially treating any negative values as 0. This approach would simplify the representation of the variance, but at the cost of potentially oversimplifying the interactions between sources of variance.

**user**:

**assistant**:
> If the total variance (T) is greater than the sum of the variances from individual sources (A, B, C), then the term would usually be referred to as "unexplained variance" or "residual variance". 
> 
> In this case, the term captures the variance that's not accounted for by the known sources, rather than the overlap between them. This could be due to measurement error, other unknown sources of variance, or complex interactions between the known sources that aren't being captured by the model. It's effectively the opposite situation from when the sum of individual variances is greater than the total, which implies overlap or shared variance.

**user**:

**assistant**:
> Yes, if the total variance (T) is less than the sum of the variances from individual sources (A, B, C), the excess variance can be attributed to a new term, say D, which represents the overlapping or shared variance.

> However, please note that attributing this excess to a single "shared" term is a simplification that may not fully capture the complexities of the interaction between these sources of variance. It's essentially a way of accounting for the fact that the sources of variance are not fully independent and have some overlap, but it doesn't provide any additional insight into how these sources interact. For a more detailed understanding of the interactions, more complex modeling techniques would be necessary.
