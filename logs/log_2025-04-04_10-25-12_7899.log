> Dear Ashley,
> 
> I am a researcher at the University of Delaware, working with the London School of Economics, and I have recently started some funded work with HMT on the risks of climate change and potential for adaptation. Our goal is to capture evidence on UK risks and adaptation into a tool that HMT and others can use to explore different adaptation plans.

> I would like to invite you to be our representative from Defra in an advisory panel for the project. Daisy Jameson, now at LSE, suggested I reach out to you.
> 
> As an example of this groups' role, one of the first meetings of the panel would be to provide input on the structure of the projection scenarios. We want to make sure that our scenarios can support work being done by other groups, including OBR, Defra, and the CCC.
> 
> The current project is just for 12 months, and the advisory group would probably meet four times over that period.
> 
> Let me know if you would be available to participate in this group, or if you would like more information.

> Sounds interesting and more than happy to be part of the advisory group, thanks for the offer.
> 
> Just as a brief intro I lead on adaptation economics evidence here in Defra so we’re interested the broad evidence base across risks and sectors to support all government decision making. Our team is responsible for delivering the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment and a range of other research, such as the recent UKRI-Defra Maximising UK Adaptation to Climate Change (MACC), as well as the Accounting for the Effects of Climate Change Green Book supplementary guidance, which we are about to publish an update of imminently.
