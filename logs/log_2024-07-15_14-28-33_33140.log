**assistant**:
> To create a daily sequence from a given date to today in Julia, you can use the `Date` type from the `Dates` standard library and the `today()` function to get the current date. Then, generate the sequence using `Date` and a range. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
> 
> 1. Import the `Dates` module.
> 2. Define your start date.
> 3. Use the `today()` function to get the current date.
> 4. Create the sequence using the `start:step:stop` syntax, where `step` is `Day(1)`.
> 
> Here's a sample code snippet:
> 
> ```julia
> using Dates
> 
> # Define your start date
> start_date = Date(2023, 7, 15)  # Replace with your start date
> 
> # Get today's date
> end_date = today()
> 
> # Generate the sequence of daily dates
> daily_sequence = start_date:Day(1):end_date
> 
> # Convert to array if you want to work with it as a collection
> daily_sequence_array = collect(daily_sequence)
> ```
> 
> This will give you an array `daily_sequence_array` containing all dates from `start_date` to today. For example, if the start date is July 15, 2023, and today is July 15, 2024, the array will contain all daily dates between those two dates inclusive.
