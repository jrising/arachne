**user**:
> What does it mean for a person to be listed last among the authors of a scientific paper?
**assistant**:
> In many scientific disciplines, the last author listed on a scientific paper often holds a special significance. This spot is typically reserved for the senior author or principal investigator, the person who provided the overarching supervision for the research project.
> 
> This convention, however, varies across different fields. For instance, in fields such as mathematics or theoretical physics, authors are often listed alphabetically, irrespective of their contribution.
> 
> It's crucial to realize that the authorship order may not fully reflect the exact contributions of each author. This is why some journals now require an 'author contribution' section in the manuscript, where each authorâ€™s specific roles are explained.
> 
> As with many aspects of academia, practice varies, and it's always a good idea to understand the conventional practices of the specific field or ask for clarification when necessary. In some cases, the corresponding author (the point of contact for the paper) might be indicated with a special symbol instead of their position in the author list.
