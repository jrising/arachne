**user**:
> Are black carbon and carbon black the same thing?
**assistant**:
> No, black carbon and carbon black are not the same thing, even though their names sound similar.

> **Black carbon** is a type of carbon particle in the atmosphere that results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass. These particles are known for their impact on climate change because they absorb sunlight, thereby heating the atmosphere. They can also land on snow or ice, reducing its ability to reflect sunlight back into space and thus increasing global temperatures. Moreover, when inhaled, black carbon can have detrimental effects on human health.

> On the other hand, **carbon black** is a form of paracrystalline carbon that is intentionally manufactured in a variety of processes for use in products like tires, plastics, inks, coatings, and paints. It's a type of soot, but with a more organized structure. It's used primarily as a reinforcing filler in tires and other rubber products, and to provide pigmentation for different types of inks, paints, and plastics. While it can contribute to pollution if not handled correctly, the major environmental and health concerns are generally associated with black carbon due to its contribution to global warming and adverse health impacts from inhalation.
