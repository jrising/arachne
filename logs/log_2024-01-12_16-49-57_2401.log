**user**:
> In the email, I see a person referred to as "md Ndoffène" but I don't know how that relates to their full name, Coumba Ndoffène Diouf. What is the md, and should it be capitalized?
**assistant**:
> In this context, "md" likely stands for "Monsieur", which is the French equivalent of "Mr.". The name "Ndoffène" is a given name, making "Md Ndoffène" a respectful title and name - essentially "Mr. Ndoffène". Although abbreviations for such titles can vary between cultures and languages, they're often in lowercase when written out in full.
> 
> Traditionally, the term "Md" is used in several countries with French as their official language to refer to men in a formal context instead of "Mr.". However, in international or English-speaking contexts, "Mr." is standard.
> 
> Regarding capitalization, you would typically capitalize the first letter of the name ("Ndoffène") following the title. The title itself ("md") can typically be in lower case, although it's also not incorrect to capitalize it ("Md"). Careful attention to the recipient's culture and the language of the conversation will help you choose the most appropriate form.
