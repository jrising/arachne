> How do I check if a value is a vector (of any type) in Julia?

> In Julia, the `isa` function is used to check the type of a variable. However, it only checks if the variable is exactly of a certain type and doesn't check for subtypes. Therefore, you might want to use the `isa` function combined with `AbstractVector` (the abstract type for all 1D arrays) to check if a value is a vector of any type. Here's how to do it:
> 
> ```julia
> function is_vector(v)
>     return isa(v, AbstractVector)
> end
> 
> # Test the function
> println(is_vector([1, 2, 3]))  # returns true
> println(is_vector(123))  # returns false
> ```

> This function `is_vector` takes an argument `v` and checks if `v` is of type `AbstractVector`, which encompasses all vector types in Julia. The `isa` function returns `true` if `v` is a subtype of `AbstractVector` and `false` otherwise.
