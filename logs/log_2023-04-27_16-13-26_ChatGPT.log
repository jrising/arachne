> One term that could mean "goodness by virtue of enthusiasm" is "zeal." Zeal is a strong feeling of enthusiasm or excitement about something, often associated with a particular cause or belief. It implies a passionate commitment to that cause, and a willingness to work hard and make sacrifices in pursuit of it. So, when someone is said to have zeal, it suggests that they are not only enthusiastic, but also actively and energetically working towards some greater good.
