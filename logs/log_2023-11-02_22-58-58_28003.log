>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

> Greetings Professor Rising,
> 
> My name is Scott Schwartz, and I am applying for admission to the Masters of Environmental Economics (EE) at the University of Delaware.  I am excited about the ample opportunities that University of Delaware has to offer. Moreover, I recently spoke with Dr. Palm-Forest and she encouraged me to reach out.  
> 
> During my time as an undergraduate, I worked in a neuroendocrinology research lab for 4 years and feel I’d be an asset to your research projects. I enjoyed examining your publication “Estimating a Social Cost of Carbon for Global Energy Consumption” and believe aspects overlap with my research interests. I hope to illustrate how carbon pricing might be more effective than other incentive programs at shifting markets to renewable energy sources. With extensive industrial policy becoming increasingly difficult to fund, an effective carbon pricing model will be integral to a rapid economic shift.
> 
> I would be interested to know if you are currently accepting students for your research group? I have attached my CV and transcripts below which further details my laboratory and professional experiences.

> I am looking forward to hearing from you. Please feel free to contact me at this email or at (626)-590-7413.

**assistant**:
> Dear Scott,
> 
> Thank you for your interest in our programs and reaching out. It appears you're applying for the Masters in Environmental Economics (EE), which is a self-funded program at the University of Delaware. You mentioned your work in a neuroendocrinology research lab and have an interest in examining how carbon pricing might be more effective than other incentive programs at shifting markets to renewable energy sources. 
> 
> As these topics align with the research I'm currently working on, I think you could be a good fit for the program. I recommend you continue with your application and ensure you mention the overlap in research interests in your Statement of Purpose. 
> 
> Regarding your question, my research group is always open to applications from prospective students. However, it's essential to remember funding is always a constraint. Therefore, I encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funds. 
> 
> Thank you again for your interest and I look forward to receiving your application.
