> As of Winter 2024, over 7 million people are actively seeking employment in the United States, and almost a third of currently working people can barely make ends meet for themselves and their families. Due to unjust practices and policies, economic inequality is increasing in frontline communities, with women, People of Color, and those without college degrees struggling more to secure well-paid, dignified employment. 
> 
> The passage of hallmark legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act coupled with changes in market pressure generated a plan for more than $2 trillion in climate, energy, and environmental investments in the next 10 years. These investments will create more than 9 million good jobs over the next decade, with over 900,000 jobs in the high-performance buildings sector. The market demand for these jobs increases each year as more building performance policies pass and the demand for high-performance buildings increases. 
> 
> IMT supports economic growth in the green buildings sector through initiatives that increase both the demand of high-performance building workers and the supply of trained businesses and employees. Improving buildings creates jobs for energy auditors, building managers, HVAC technicians, electricians, and many others.
> 
> Our Building Performance Partnership is a national network of local organizations working to make building performance policies a reality for their communities. Members of the Partnership are staffed high-performance building Hubs that deliver customizable best-practice and educational resources to support real estate culture shifts toward better buildings, building performance policy compliance, and workforce development initiatives. IMT manages the Building Innovation Hub in Washington DC. In partnership with local government and community groups, that team created the free Capital Region Green Buildings Career Map that showcases high-performance building sector jobs and the paths job seekers can take to secure them. We are also a proud partner of the Justice Climate Fund, a diverse coalition of community lenders and an awardee of the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Together with the Building Performance Partnership Hubs and industry partners through the Relay Network, we will be providing market development and training support to ensure funding opportunities flow to the buildings in our communities who need it most.

> Here is a version adapted towards New York and funding from the New York Community Trust:
> 
> As of Winter 2024, over 7 million people are actively seeking employment in the United States. Economic inequality is increasing in frontline communities, with many struggling citizens unable to meet their basic needs. This is particularly seen in women, People of Color, and individuals without college degrees. 
> 
> However, new opportunities have arisen with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and other market forces. These changes paved the way for over $2 trillion in climate, energy, and environmental investments across the nation in the next decade. It's projected that these investments will create over 9 million decent jobs, with more than 900,000 in the high-performance buildings sector alone. 
> 
> The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) addresses this challenge by supporting economic growth in the green building sector. The work is carried out through programs that boost both the demand for high-performance building workers and the supply of trained businesses and personnel. Transforming buildings into high-performance structures creates opportunities for professionals like energy auditors, building managers, HVAC technicians, and electricians.
> 
> IMT is the force behind the Building Performance Partnership, a nationwide network of local organizations striving to promote building performance policies. Members of this partnership operate Building Innovation Hubs that provide customizable, best-practice, and educational resources. This network is designed to support a cultural shift in real estate towards superior building performance and workforce development initiatives.
> 
> The Building Innovation Hub we've managed in Washington DC has made great strides in partnership with the local government and community groups. We now seek to adapt this model for New York, under the guidance and partnership of like-minded organizations and the New York Community Trust. 
> 
> In the DC model, we successfully launched the free Capital Region Green Buildings Career Map. This map highlights jobs in the high-performance building sector and practically shows job seekers possible career paths. We believe this model can have tremendous impact in New York, especially in supporting underprivileged job seekers. 
> 
> In our pursuit of making this a reality, we are a proud ally of the Justice Climate Fund and an awardee of the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program by the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Together, we fight for equitable distribution of funds to the most vulnerable and needy buildings in our communities. Our partnership with the Building Performance Partnership Hubs and industry partners through the Relay Network plays a vital role in ensuring this goal is achieved.
> 
> Our vision is for a New York Building Innovation Hub that, partnered with the New York Community Trust among other local organizations, can help transform the local green building industry, all while creating jobs and more sustainable buildings throughout the city. We look forward to discussing how we can partner to make this vision a reality.
