> These data depict zones for the protection of deep-sea coral from physical damage by fishing gear. Commercial fishermen are prohibited from using bottom-tending gear such as otter trawls, beam trawls, hydraulic dredges, non-hydraulic dredges, seines, longlines, pots and traps, and sink or anchored gillnets within these zones. Additional coral protection areas may also be defined as part of an area of particular concern within an essential fish habitat.

> Delaware marine waters currently feature diverse protective measures by various entities, yet show significant room for expansion and improvement. The area notably comprises the Coral Protection Areas, designed to guard deep-sea coral from the physical damage caused by certain fishing gear, with boundaries extending beyond the continental shelf. However, there are no Marine National Monuments or National Marine Sanctuaries to showcase the area's historical and ecological significance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges provide further protection, dedicating large terrestrial and estuary parcels, but no land has been set aside for exclusive marine protection. The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve, a Category IV MPA according to IUCN, is the only substantial water-body reserve within ProtectedPlanet's records. But, even this area lacks a corresponding no-take zone. The current protections are important, but it is evident that the untapped potential for marine protection in Delaware's waters is immense. There is an urgent need to quest for a more balanced, diversified marine conservation approach, incorporating both reserve-oriented and sustainable use policies.
