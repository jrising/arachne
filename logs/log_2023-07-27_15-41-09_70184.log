> I copy images into Powerpoint a lot of different ways, and sometimes I find that the images disappear or get errors, after I have saved the presentation. How can I make sure this doesn't happen?
**assistant**:
> Errors with images disappearing in PowerPoint can have several causes. Here are some general steps to help ensure this doesn't happen:
> 
> 1. **Use the Insert Picture command:** Rather than copying and pasting, use 'Insert' > 'Pictures' on the Insert tab. This will embed the image into the presentation, reducing the likelihood of errors.
> 
> 2. **Avoid moving or renaming source files:** If an image is linked (not embedded), moving, renaming, or deleting the source file can cause errors. Always keep the source images in the same location.
> 
> 3. **Check file size limits:** The size of images can impact PowerPoint's performance. High-resolution images can make the overall file size quite large, which might lead to some images not loading properly. Try to use images with lower resolution or compress your images using 'Picture Tools' > 'Format' > 'Compress Pictures'.
> 
> 4. **Ensure your software is up to date:** Keeping your PowerPoint software up to date can help avoid bugs and glitches.
> 
> 5. **Try saving in a different format:** If your presentation is in ".ppt" format, try saving it in the ".pptx" format. The newer format is more reliable and less likely to cause issues.
> 
> 6. **Use 'Package Presentation for CD':** If moving the presentation to another device, use the 'Package Presentation for CD' option. This will ensure all linked files, including images, are included.
