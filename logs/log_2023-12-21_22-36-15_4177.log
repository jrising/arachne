**user**:

**assistant**:
> The plot isn't getting zoomed to the desired area because the `plot` command from geopandas does not automatically set the axes limits to be the extent of the plotted shapefile/dataset. 
> 
> To fix your issue, you just need to set the x and y limits of your plot to match the extent contained within your `subset` GeoDataFrame.
> 
> You can find these limits by using the `total_bounds` method on the `geometry` of your GeoDataFrame. Here's how to modify your code:

> In this revised code, we calculate the bounds of the circular buffer around the point and then use those to set the limits of the plot (`ax.set_xlim` and `ax.set_ylim`). This will ensure that your plot will be zoomed to the area you are interested in. Note that this method works for polygon and point geometries. The buffer is needed for point geometries to provide a finite size for the bounding box. With polygon geometries, you can use `total_bounds` directly on the geometry.
**user**:
> That worked. Now, I have multiple shapefiles that I would like to plot for the same area. How can I do this?
**assistant**:

> 2. Subset each shapefile to include only the polygons that intersect your desired area.

> In this example, I assume you have separate shapefile directories for each data layer (`whaling/`, `cities/`, and `rivers/`). You can modify the directory paths according to your actual data.
> 
> The code reads each shapefile into a separate `GeoDataFrame`. Then, it subsets each `GeoDataFrame` to include only the polygons that intersect the desired area (`circle`). The subsetted `GeoDataFrame` objects are then combined into a single `GeoDataFrame` named `combined`.
> 
> Finally, the `combined` `GeoDataFrame` is plotted on a figure with customized size (if needed), and the plot limits are set based on the bounding box of the `circle` area to ensure the plot zooms to the desired area.
> 
> Feel free to adapt this code to match the actual shapefile locations and names in your case.
**user**:
> How can I style these different shapefiles differently?
**assistant**:
> To style each shapefile differently, you can plot each `GeoDataFrame` separately on the same `matplotlib` axes and specify different styling options for each. Here's how you can adjust the code to do this:
> 
> ```python
> import geopandas as gpd
> from shapely.geometry import Point
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> 
> # Read the shapefiles into separate GeoDataFrame objects
> world = gpd.read_file('whaling/ne_10m_land/ne_10m_land.shp')
> cities = gpd.read_file('cities/cities.shp')
> rivers = gpd.read_file('rivers/rivers.shp')
> 
> # Specify your desired area as a point
> point = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[Point(-70.094363, 41.2852961)], crs=world.crs)
> 
> # Create a buffer around the point and unify the geometries
> circle = point.geometry.buffer(0.5).unary_union
> 
> # Subset each GeoDataFrame to include only intersecting polygons
> world_subset = world.loc[world.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> cities_subset = cities.loc[cities.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> rivers_subset = rivers.loc[rivers.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> 
> # Create the plot and customize the figure size if needed
> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
> 
> # Plot each subset on the axes using different styles
> world_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='tan')  # Style the world land area
> cities_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=5)  # Style the cities
> rivers_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', linewidth=1)  # Style the rivers
> 
> # Set the plot limits based on the bounding box of the area
> minx, miny, maxx, maxy = circle.bounds
> ax.set_xlim(minx, maxx)
> ax.set_ylim(miny, maxy)
> 
> # Show the plot
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> In this code:
> - `world_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='tan')` styles the land areas with a tan color.
> - `cities_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=5)` styles the cities with red points and a specific marker size.
> - `rivers_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', linewidth=1)` styles the rivers with a blue line and a specific line width.
> 
> You can add additional styling parameters such as `marker=`, `linestyle=`, `alpha=` for transparency, and many others depending on the type of geometries (LineString, Point, Polygon) you're plotting and your aesthetic preferences.
> 
> Remember to ensure that the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) of all `GeoDataFrame`s is consistent so that they align properly when plotted together. If they are not, you will need to reproject one of the `GeoDataFrame`s to match the CRS of the others.
**user**:
> My main three shapefiles have polygons, but for one I just want the outlines of the polygons to show. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> To show just the outlines of the polygons for one of your shapefiles, you can use the `edgecolor` and `facecolor` parameters in the `plot` method. Setting `facecolor` to 'none' will make the polygons transparent and display only the outlines. Here's how you can adjust the code:
> 
> ```python
> import geopandas as gpd
> from shapely.geometry import Point
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> 
> # Read the shapefiles into separate GeoDataFrame objects
> world = gpd.read_file('whaling/ne_10m_land/ne_10m_land.shp')
> additional_polygons = gpd.read_file('another_shapefile/polygons.shp')  # Another example shapefile with polygons
> rivers = gpd.read_file('rivers/rivers.shp')
> 
> # Specify your desired area as a point
> point = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[Point(-70.094363, 41.2852961)], crs=world.crs)
> 
> # Create a buffer around the point and unify the geometries
> circle = point.geometry.buffer(0.5).unary_union
> 
> # Subset each GeoDataFrame to include only intersecting polygons
> world_subset = world.loc[world.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> additional_polygons_subset = additional_polygons.loc[additional_polygons.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> rivers_subset = rivers.loc[rivers.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> 
> # Create the plot and customize the figure size if needed
> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
> 
> # Plot each subset on the axes using different styles
> world_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='tan')  # Style the world land area
> additional_polygons_subset.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='black', facecolor='none', linewidth=1)  # Outline style polygons
> rivers_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', linewidth=1)  # Style the rivers
> 
> # Set the plot limits based on the bounding box of the area
> minx, miny, maxx, maxy = circle.bounds
> ax.set_xlim(minx, maxx)
> ax.set_ylim(miny, maxy)
> 
> # Show the plot
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> In this adjusted code snippet, `additional_polygons_subset.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='black', facecolor='none', linewidth=1)` will plot only the borders of the polygons with a black edge color, and no fill color inside the polygons.
> 
> Remember to replace `'another_shapefile/polygons.shp'` with the actual path to your shapefile. Adjust the `edgecolor` and `linewidth` to suit your style preferences if needed.
**user**:
> And one of my files is actually a CSV loaded with pd.read_csv, but it has a latitude and longitude column. How can I plot the points in this?
**assistant**:
> To plot points from a CSV file that contains latitude and longitude columns, you can convert the DataFrame to a GeoDataFrame and then plot it along with your shapefiles. Here's how you can do that:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> import geopandas as gpd
> from shapely.geometry import Point
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> 
> # Read the shapefiles into separate GeoDataFrame objects
> world = gpd.read_file('whaling/ne_10m_land/ne_10m_land.shp')
> rivers = gpd.read_file('rivers/rivers.shp')
> 
> # Load the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame
> csv_data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/csvfile.csv')
> 
> # Convert the DataFrame to a GeoDataFrame
> gdf_from_csv = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
>     csv_data, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(csv_data.longitude, csv_data.latitude)
> )
> 
> # Ensure the GeoDataFrame has the same CRS as your shapefiles
> gdf_from_csv.crs = world.crs
> 
> # Specify your desired area as a point with buffer
> point = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[Point(-70.094363, 41.2852961)], crs=world.crs)
> circle = point.geometry.buffer(0.5).unary_union
> 
> # Subset each dataset to include only the elements within the desired area
> world_subset = world.loc[world.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> rivers_subset = rivers.loc[rivers.geometry.intersects(circle)]
> csv_subset = gdf_from_csv.loc[gdf_from_csv.geometry.within(circle)]  # Use within for points
> 
> # Create the plot and customize the figure size
> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
> 
> # Plot each layer with different styles
> world_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='tan')  # Style the world land area
> rivers_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', linewidth=1)  # Style the rivers
> csv_subset.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=5)  # Style the CSV points
> 
> # Set the plot limits to the bounding box of the area
> minx, miny, maxx, maxy = circle.bounds
> ax.set_xlim(minx, maxx)
> ax.set_ylim(miny, maxy)
> 
> # Show the plot
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> In the code above:
> 
> - `csv_data` is the DataFrame created from your CSV file.
> - `gpd.points_from_xy` is used to create `Point` geometries from the longitude and latitude columns.
> - The resulting GeoDataFrame `gdf_from_csv` is given the same CRS (coordinate reference system) as the `world` dataset.
> - The GeoDataFrame `csv_subset` is created by subsetting the `gdf_from_csv` to only include points within the buffered area (`circle`).
> 
> Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/csvfile.csv'`, `'longitude'`, and `'latitude'` with the actual path to your CSV file and the appropriate headers for the latitude and longitude columns.
> 
> This will plot your CSV data points as red points on top of the other geospatial layers, ensuring that all layers are positioned accurately on the same map. Adjust the `color` and `markersize` as desired for the visual style you want to achieve.
