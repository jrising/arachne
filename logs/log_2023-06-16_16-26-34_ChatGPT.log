> In the context of grant management and proposal budgets, MTDC stands for Modified Total Direct Costs and IDC refers to Indirect Costs.
> 
> Direct costs are expenses that can be directly tied to a specific project or grant, such as salaries, travel expenses, materials and supplies, and any other costs that are incurred exclusively because of and for the project. In your case, this would include the cost of the graduate student's time spent on the project.
> 
> Indirect costs (also sometimes called F&A, for Facilities & Administration), on the other hand, are costs that an organization incurs for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular project. These might include utilities, general office supplies, or administrative services.
> 
> The Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC) base is the total direct costs minus certain exemptions. These exemptions often include items such as equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care and tuition remission, rental costs, scholarships, and fellowships as well as the portion of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of $25,000.
> 
> When your grant manager mentions "using MTDC as the IDC base", it means that she's calculating the indirect costs based on the MTDC. In other words, the indirect costs are a percentage (in this case, 15%) of the direct costs, after excluding the exempted costs.
> 
> When she mentions that tuition is excluded from the MTDC, she means that tuition fees (likely for the grad student you mentioned) are not included in the calculation of indirect costs.
> 
> When she says "we may be able to apply 15% to total direct costs since this is a reduced rate", it suggests she's considering applying the 15% rate to the total direct costs, including those usually exempted in MTDC calculations (like tuition), given the rate is lower than the organization's negotiated rate. This would depend on the terms and conditions of the funder.
> 
> It's important to note that whether or not the student's tuition is covered would depend on the specific stipulations of the grant. It's usually considered a direct cost, not an indirect cost. However, your grant manager's message doesn't necessarily mean that tuition wouldn't be covered; it simply means it's not included in the calculation of indirect costs. To get a definitive answer on this, you would need to check the specific terms and conditions of the grant, or ask your grant manager directly.
