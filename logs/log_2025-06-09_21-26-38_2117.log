> My son just turned 5 and we want him to learn to sleep in underwear, but he keeps wetting the bed. Are there ways we can help him learn to get up if he needs to?

> Teaching your son to sleep in underwear is a big step, and it's great that you're looking for ways to support him. Here are a few ideas that might help:
> 
> 1. **Limit liquids before bed**: Try to reduce the amount of liquids he has in the 1-2 hours before bedtime. This can help reduce the likelihood of him needing to go during the night.
> 
> 2. **Establish a bedtime routine**: Ensure he uses the bathroom right before bed. You might also consider waking him up to use the bathroom again before you go to sleep, at least initially.
> 
> 3. **Incentivize waking up dry**: Create a reward system to positively reinforce nights when he wakes up dry. Stickers on a chart can be a fun, visual way to do this.
> 
> 4. **Use a waterproof mattress protector**: To create a stress-free environment, protect the mattress in case of accidents. This way, both you and he can focus on learning rather than the consequences of wetting the bed.
> 
> 5. **Bedwetting alarms**: These can be helpful if the issue persists. They're designed to detect moisture and wake the child so they can go to the bathroom. It may take some time, but many parents find them effective.
> 
> 6. **Talk openly about it**: Make sure he knows it's normal and okay. Discuss strategies during the day, so he doesn't feel stressed about it at night.
> 
> Be patient and remember that every child is different. Some take a bit longer to master this skill, and that's perfectly normal. He'll get there!
