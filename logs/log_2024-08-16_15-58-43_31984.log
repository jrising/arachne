> What's a basic Julia line to do a scatter plot with Plots?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! To create a simple scatter plot using the Plots.jl package in Julia, you can use the following line of code:
> 
> ```julia
> using Plots
> scatter(x, y)
> ```
> 
> Here, `x` and `y` should be arrays or vectors that contain the data points you want to plot. For example, if you have data like:
> 
> ```julia
> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> y = [5, 7, 4, 6, 8]
> ```
> 
> You can create the scatter plot by calling:
> 
> ```julia
> scatter(x, y)
> ```
> 
> This will plot `y` versus `x` with scatter points. You can customize the plot further using various attributes, such as marker size, color, or labels. Let me know if you need help with any specific customizations!
