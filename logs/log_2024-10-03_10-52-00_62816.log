> I'm trying to use the PNAS LaTeX template, but I don't understand the working on "firstpage". Here's what it has in the template:
> ```
> \firstpage{12}
> % Use \firstpage to indicate which paragraph and line will start the second page and subsequent formatting. In this example, there are a total of 11 paragraphs on the first page, counting the first level heading as a paragraph. The value {12} represents the number of the paragraph starting the second page. If a paragraph runs over onto the second page, include a bracket with the paragraph line number starting the second page, followed by the paragraph number in curly brackets, e.g. "\firstpage[4]{11}".

**assistant**:
> Based on the explanation in the PNAS LaTeX template, the `\firstpage` command is used to specify where the second page of your document starts. If you have a paragraph that continues onto the second page, you'll need to determine the line number on which the second page begins within that paragraph.
> 
> Here's what you should do:
> 
> 1. **Identify the paragraph number**: It seems like you're already aware that it's paragraph #4 that runs over to the second page.
> 
> 2. **Determine the line number**: Find out the line number where the content shifts to the second page. This might require you to compile your document and look at the output to decide where the page break happens.
> 
> 3. **Use the `\firstpage` command accordingly**: Insert the line number in brackets and the paragraph number in curly braces in the `\firstpage` command. For example, if the content of paragraph #4 continues onto the second page, starting on line 3, you would write:
> 
>    ```latex
>    \firstpage[3]{4}
>    ```
> 
> This tells the document that the second page begins on line 3 of paragraph 4. Adjust the line number as necessary based on your document's layout.
