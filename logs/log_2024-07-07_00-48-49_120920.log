> What is "programmatic decision making" as a possible responsibility I might have in working on a grant?
**assistant**:
> Programmatic decision-making in the context of grant work typically refers to the systematic process of making decisions related to the implementation, management, and evaluation of a grant-funded program. Here's what that might include:
> 
> 1. **Implementation Decisions**: You will be making choices about how best to carry out the grant-funded program, i.e., deciding what specific actions are needed to accomplish the program's goals. This might involve choosing between different methodologies, determining resources needed, setting timelines, etc.
> 
> 2. **Management Decisions**: These involve governance of the program. You would be deciding how to allocate resources (like time, personnel, and funds), manage relationships with stakeholders, handle reporting requirements, and mitigate any risks or issues that arise.
> 
> 3. **Evaluation Decisions**: To evaluate the program's success, decisions might need to be made around what metrics to track, how to collect and analyze data, and how to use that data to improve the program. 
> 
> 4. **Strategic Decisions**: These revolve around aligning the program's direction to larger organizational or grant objectives. This might involve making decisions to scale efforts, pivot program activities, or make other long-term changes based on ongoing assessments of the program's effectiveness and the evolving context.
> 
> In sum, "programmatic decision-making" consists of making discriminative and judgmental decisions to ensure that the program can effectively achieve its goals within the grant's limitations. Given your interdisciplinary modeling expertise, you would likely excel in this regard by combining analytical skills with strategic thinking.
