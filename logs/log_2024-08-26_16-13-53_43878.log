> How do I make a plot with Julia's Plots that's a vertical line at 0.3, in a plot ranging from x = 0 to 1 and y = 0 to 1?
**assistant**:
> You can create a vertical line at \(x = 0.3\) using Julia's `Plots` package. Here's a simple way to do it:
> 
> ```julia
> using Plots
> 
> # Define the range of the plot
> x_range = 0:0.01:1
> y_range = 0:0.01:1
> 
> # Create the vertical line data
> x_line = [0.3, 0.3]
> y_line = [0, 1]
> 
> # Create the plot
> plot(x_range, y_range, seriestype = :scatter, label = false) # Dummy plot to define range
> plot!([0, 1], [0, 0], color = :white, legend = false) # Maintain full plot range
> plot!(x_line, y_line, seriestype = :path, color = :red, linewidth = 2, label = "Vertical Line")
> ```
> 
> Here's a breakdown of the code:
> 
> - You first set up the full range for the x and y axes. The initial `plot` defines the plot range. The dummy plot using `seriestype = :scatter` is a simple way to ensure the plot ranges from 0 to 1.
> - The `plot!` function is used to overlay on the existing plot, and here it draws the vertical line at `x = 0.3`.
> - The line is drawn with a series type `:path`, colored red, and the line width set to 2 for visibility.
> 
> This should create a plot with a vertical line at \(x = 0.3\) within the specified range.
