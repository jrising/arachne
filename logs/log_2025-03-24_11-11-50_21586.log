> What's the right way to make a new version of a repo on github? I have a project in one repo, and it has gone though multiple versions. Now I want to continue the work on that project in another repo. There may still be updates to the first repo, for bug fixes, but it's mostly going to go static.

> To create a new version of a project in a separate repository while maintaining the original repository for potential bug fixes, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Create a New Repository**: On GitHub, create a new repository for the next version of your project.
> 
> 2. **Clone the Original Repository**: Clone your original repository to your local machine if you haven't already:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git clone https://github.com/username/original-repo.git
>    cd original-repo
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Create a New Branch** (optional): If you want to keep track of the origin version in a branch, create a new branch:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git checkout -b new-version-branch
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Copy Files to the New Repository**: Navigate to the directory of your new project version, then copy the necessary files from your original project directory. You can use a file manager or command-line tools to do this.
> 
> 5. **Initialize the New Repository**: In the directory of your new project version, initialize a git repository and add the new remote:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git init
>    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git
>    ```
> 
> 6. **Stage and Commit Changes**: Stage and commit all the files you added or modified:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git add .
>    git commit -m "Initialize new version of the project"
>    ```
> 
> 7. **Push to the New Repository**: Push your changes to the new repository:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git push -u origin main
>    ```
> 
> 8. **Maintain Both Repositories**: You can now maintain both repositories. Use the original repository for bug fixes as needed, and continue developing features or major changes in the new repository.
> 
> This approach allows you to separate changes cleanly while keeping the history in the new version if desired. If you want an explicit link between the two repos' histories, you could also fork the original repository and then push updates from the forked repo to the new one.

**assistant**:
> If you want to copy over all branches and their histories from your original repository to a new repository, you can do this by following these steps:
> 
> ### Step-by-Step Process
> 
> 1. **Clone the Original Repository**: Clone your original repository to your local machine:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git clone --mirror https://github.com/username/original-repo.git
>    cd original-repo.git
>    ```
> 
>    The `--mirror` option clones all branches, tags, and history.
> 
> 2. **Create the New Repository**: On GitHub, create a new repository where you want to transfer the project.
> 
> 3. **Add the New Remote**: Add the new repository as a remote:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git remote add new-origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Push All Branches and Tags**: Push all branches and tags from the original repository to the new one:
> 
>    ```bash
>    git push new-origin --all
>    git push new-origin --tags
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Cleanup** (optional): After confirming that everything has transferred correctly, you can delete the local clone if you donâ€™t need it anymore:
> 
>    ```bash
>    cd ..
>    rm -rf original-repo.git
>    ```
> 
> ### Final Notes
> 
> - **Maintaining Updates**: You can continue to pull updates from the original repository into your local cloned version (if you keep it) by adding the original repo as an additional remote and pulling changes as needed.
>   
> - **Branch Management**: After pushing to the new repository, you can update or modify branches independently in each repository.
> 
> This process ensures that all your branches and their commit histories are carried over, giving you a complete mirror of the work you've done so far. Let me know if you need more details or further assistance!
