**user**:
> I have a flask application, which I am trying to run using a Passenger router. On the initial request, everything works fine. But when an action is done, and a post is sent to one of the routes, I get back the response "Incomplete response received from application". When the flask application is run on its own, this works fine. I think the problem may be related to the fact that the given route is designed to stream data back to the browser. Is that likely, and how can I get Passenger to allow streaming?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it seems likely that the issue is related to the streaming feature in your Flask application, given that the problem appears only when you send a POST request to that specific route.
> 
> In order to get Passenger to work with streaming, you should configure Passenger to use the `--disable-websockets` option, which disables WebSocket support and, as a side effect, allows streaming support.
> 
> You can configure this option in one of the following ways, depending on your Passenger installation:
> 
> 1. **Standalone mode**: If you're running Passenger in standalone mode, add the `--disable-websockets` option when starting Passenger. For example:
> 
>    ```
>    passenger start --disable-websockets
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Nginx**: If you're using the Passenger Nginx module, add the following configuration to your Nginx configuration file:
> 
>    ```
>    location / {
>        ...
>        passenger_enabled on;
>        passenger_set_header X-Passenger-Disable-Websockets true;
>        ...
>    }
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Apache**: If you're using the Passenger Apache module, add this configuration to your Apache virtual host configuration:
> 
>    ```
>    <Location "/">
>        ...
>        PassengerEnabled on;
>        PassengerDisableWebsockets true;
>        ...
>    </Location>
>    ```
> 
> Once you make the changes, restart your Passenger server, and your Flask application should now be able to stream data to the browser.
