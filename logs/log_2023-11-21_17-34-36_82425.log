**user**:
> What is loss & damage, as understood by the UNFCCC?
**assistant**:
> "Loss and Damage" refers to a particular aspect of climate change that deals with the costs and impacts of weather events and slow onset events that adaptation and mitigation efforts are unable to prevent. The concept was introduced and further defined under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a third pillar of climate action, alongside mitigation and adaptation.
> 
> Its understanding has three main elements:
> 
> 1. **Risk reduction**: This involves proactive measures to reduce current and future risks through improving infrastructure, establishing early warning systems, implementing agricultural adaptation measures, etc.
>   
> 2. **Risk retention**: This involves coping with losses through measures like social safety nets, governmental assistance, and catastrophe bonds.
> 
> 3. **Risk transfer**: This includes the use of insurance mechanisms to transfer the financial risks of climate events to a larger pool or to financial markets.
> 
> The concept of Loss and Damage was officially recognized in 2010, at the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) in Cancun, Mexico. It was further refined in 2013 at COP19, in Warsaw, Poland, where the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) was established. The main purpose of WIM is to enhance knowledge and support on areas like risk assessment, risk management, risk transfer, and resilience of climate change impacts.
> 
> The Paris Agreement in 2015 further recognized Loss and Damage as an integral part of climate action but did not make any provision for the compensation of Loss and Damage by developed countries. Minor progress has been made on defining the finance part of Loss and Damage at subsequent annual rounds of negotiation under the UNFCCC.
**user**:
> How much financial support is expected to be available for loss and damage?
**assistant**:
> The availability of financial support specifically dedicated to Loss and Damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has been a topic of ongoing negotiations and discussions among the member countries.
> 
> Currently, there is no specific agreement or target for the overall financial support specifically allocated to Loss and Damage. The provision of financial resources for Loss and Damage is primarily addressed through the existing financial mechanisms and channels under the UNFCCC, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other climate finance initiatives.
> 
> The GCF, established in 2010, is the main financial mechanism under the UNFCCC and aims to support developing countries in their efforts to address climate change, including adaptation and mitigation activities. While Loss and Damage is an important aspect of the climate finance discussions, the funding available for Loss and Damage is not explicitly separated or accounted for within the GCF.
> 
> It's worth noting that the issue of financial support for Loss and Damage has been a matter of debate and differing opinions among countries, particularly between developed and developing nations. Developing countries, particularly those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, have been advocates for dedicated and additional financial support for Loss and Damage. However, the level of financial support and mechanisms for such support are subjects of ongoing negotiations and still under development.
> 
> As discussions and negotiations continue, the availability and scale of financial support for Loss and Damage are likely to be determined through future agreements and commitments made under the UNFCCC.
