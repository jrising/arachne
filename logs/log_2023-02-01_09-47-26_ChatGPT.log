> How are different shipping months handled in futures markets?
**assistant**:
> In futures markets, different shipping months are often referred to as "contract months." The futures contract for each contract month typically specifies the specific commodity that is being traded, the amount of the commodity, and the delivery date. The delivery date is the date by which the buyer of the futures contract must take delivery of the underlying commodity.
> 
> Different contract months for the same commodity may trade at different prices, reflecting differences in supply and demand for the commodity in each contract month. For example, if the supply of a commodity is expected to be tighter in one contract month than in another, the futures price for the contract month with the tighter supply may be higher.
> 
> Investors can trade futures contracts for different contract months in order to take advantage of these price differences and to hedge against price risk for the underlying commodity.
