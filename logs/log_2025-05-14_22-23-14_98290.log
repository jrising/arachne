> I remember learning the Hotelling's Rule as a result that welfare was maximized if all of the rents from non-renewable resources were invested into capital, but when I look it up it's about prices changing with interest rates. Can you explain?

> Hotelling's Rule is a fundamental principle in resource economics that addresses the economics of non-renewable resource extraction. It was introduced by Harold Hotelling in 1931 and offers insights into how the price of a non-renewable resource should evolve over time, assuming competitive markets and exhaustible resources.
> 
> The rule states that the net price (also called Hotelling rent or scarcity rent) of a non-renewable resource should increase at the rate of interest. This condition ensures that the resource owner is indifferent between extracting the resource now or extracting it later, given that leaving it in the ground them foregoes earning interest on potential extracted funds.

> Now, regarding welfare maximization and investing rents into capital, you're likely thinking of the broader sustainability concept that involves Hartwick's Rule. Hartwickâ€™s Rule builds on Hotelling by incorporating the notion of sustainability into economic planning for non-renewable resources. It suggests that if all the rents from non-renewable resources are invested in reproducible capital, then the consumption levels can remain constant over time, despite the depletion of the resource. This ensures intergenerational equity and sustained welfare.
> 
> To reconcile these: Hotelling's Rule provides the framework for price evolution and efficient resource allocation over time in a market setting, while Hartwick's Rule extends this to include investing resource rents into capital to ensure ongoing welfare. Both concepts are essential for understanding the sustainability and economic dynamics of non-renewable resources.
