> In Julia, I have a big vectorized equation: myfunction.(bigarray).

**assistant**:
> In Julia, you can optimize your function by isolating the operations that are independent of `bigarray` and computing them once before applying the function element-wise. Here's a step-by-step approach:
> 
> 1. **Precompute the Independent Operations**: Extract the operations from `myfunction` that aren't dependent on `bigarray` and precompute them separately.
> 
> 2. **Use a Closure**: Create a closure that incorporates the precomputed results and apply this closure to each element of `bigarray`.

> ```julia
> # Example of a function with operations that don't depend on bigarray
> function myfunction(x, precomputed)
>     # precomputed is independent of x (elements of bigarray)
>     result = x + precomputed
>     return result
> end
> 
> # Suppose bigarray is your large array
> bigarray = rand(1000)
> 
> # Precompute the value (example operation)
> precomputed_value = 2.0  # This value should be calculated based on your needs
> 
> # Create a closure that incorporates the precomputed value
> myfunction_with_precomputed = x -> myfunction(x, precomputed_value)
> 
> # Apply the function element-wise to bigarray
> result_array = myfunction_with_precomputed.(bigarray)

> By isolating the independent parts and using a closure, you ensure that the precomputed operations are run only once, making your code more efficient.
