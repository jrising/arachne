> I want to use an API that has a limit of 15 requests per minute. In python, how can I keep track of my budget to make sure I don't exceed it. I want to make sure I never hit the limit, and I'm not quite sure how they're counting, so I want to use a calculation that assumes the worst-case.
**assistant**:
> To manage your API request limit effectively, you can implement a rate-limiting mechanism in Python that ensures you don't exceed 15 requests per minute. Assuming a worst-case scenario where consecutive requests could count against the limit, you can introduce a delay between requests based on the time since your last set of requests. Here's a straightforward way to manage this using the `time` module in Python:
> 
> ```python
> import time
> 
> class RateLimiter:
>     def __init__(self, max_requests, period):
>         self.max_requests = max_requests
>         self.period = period
>         self.requests = []
> 
>     def request(self):
>         current_time = time.time()
> 
>         # Remove requests that are older than the period
>         self.requests = [req for req in self.requests if current_time - req < self.period]
> 
>         if len(self.requests) < self.max_requests:
>             # If we haven't hit the limit, log the request time and proceed
>             self.requests.append(current_time)
>             return True
>         else:
>             # Calculate when the oldest request will fall outside the time window
>             wait_time = self.period - (current_time - self.requests[0])
>             print(f"Rate limit reached. Sleeping for {wait_time:.2f} seconds.")
>             time.sleep(wait_time)
> 
>             # Once we sleep, approve the request and record the time
>             self.requests = [req for req in self.requests if current_time - req < self.period]
>             self.requests.append(current_time)
>             return True
> 
> # Usage
> rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=15, period=60)
> 
> while some_condition_for_api_calls:
>     if rate_limiter.request():
>         # Make your API call here
>         print("API request made")
> ```

> ### Key Points:
> 1. **Maintain a List of Requests**: Keep track of the timestamps of your requests. Only keep those that are within the last minute.
> 
> 2. **Check Before Sending Request**: Before sending each request, clean up the list by removing timestamps older than one minute. If your list size is below the limit, proceed with the request.
> 
> 3. **Introduced Delay**: If you hit the limit, calculate the required wait time based on the oldest request in your timeframe. Sleep for this duration before proceeding.
> 
> 4. **Worst-Case Scenario**: This implements a check assuming you make requests as fast as possible, keeping within the maximum requests per minute by adjusting with `time.sleep()` when needed.
> 
> This ensures that, even in a worst-case scenario, you stay under the API's request limit. Adjust the logic or sleep duration as needed based on observed server behavior, as some APIs may count differently (e.g., rolling windows or slightly different limits).
**user**:
> How about if different requests take up different amounts of the budget?
**assistant**:
> If different API requests consume differing amounts of your budget, you can modify the rate limiter to account for the specific cost of each request. Here's how to do this:
> 
> 1. **Define a Cost per Request**: Create a mapping of request types to their respective costs.
> 2. **Track Used Budget**: Maintain a count of the total budget used in the current time window (e.g., within a minute).
> 3. **Adjust Logic for Requests**: Check if adding a new request will exceed the budget and, if so, delay appropriately.

>         self.budget = budget  # Total budget available

>         self.used_budget = 0  # Used budget within the time window
>         self.requests = []  # Timestamps of requests

> ### Key Changes:
> 1. **Cost Mapping**: You define a mapping of request types to their costs (`request_costs`).
> 2. **Budget Management**: The class tracks the total used budget within the specified time window and checks against the overall budget.
> 3. **Dynamic Requests**: You can call `request()` with the specific cost of the intended API request.
> 
> ### Additional Considerations:
> - **Granular Control**: This approach allows you to manage the API usage granularly based on each request's cost, accommodating varying budgets.
> - **Handling Overhead**: Depending on the API, you might want to implement additional strategies for handling retries or optimizing request types over time.
> - **Error Handling**: Don't forget to handle potential errors with API requests (timeouts, failures) that might affect the budget or tracking.
> 
> By implementing this system, you can ensure that you're not just managing the rate of requests but also the budget they consume successfully.
