**user**:
> I have a shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object. How do I get its coordinates out?
**assistant**:
> If you have a `shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon` object, you can extract the coordinates using the `exterior` property and then calling `coords` on that, which returns a `CoordinateSequence` that can be easily converted to a list. Example code in Python is shown below:
> 
> ```python
> import shapely.geometry as sg
> 
> # Assuming "polygon" is your shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object
> polygon = sg.Polygon([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)])
> 
> # Get the exterior coordinates of the polygon
> exterior_coords = polygon.exterior.coords
> 
> # Convert to a list
> list_of_coords = list(exterior_coords)
> 
> print(list_of_coords)
> ```
> 
> This will output:
> 
> ```text
> [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0)]
> ```
> 
> Note that the first and last points are the same because it's a closed polygon.
> 
> If your Polygon has interior rings (holes), you can get their coordinates by iterating through `polygon.interiors` and calling `coords` on each.
