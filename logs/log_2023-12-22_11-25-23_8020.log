**user**:
> I want to construct a random forest where the observations are distributions. (1) What would be an appropriate splitting rule for that? (2) Is there a package in R that has the flexibility to allow this?
**assistant**:
> 1. Appropriate Splitting Rule
> 
> Dealing with observations where the responses are distributions, have several considerations such as high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and often have asymmetrical shapes and extreme values. A suitable splitting rule could be the Two-Sample Anderson-Darling Test, also called the Modified Energy Statistics (MES). 
> 
> The MES is built upon the principle of comparing the energy distance between two multivariate distributions. The energy distance measures the equivalence of these two distributions. Consequently, the MES addresses these points by assessing the difference in energies between the left and right child nodes from a potential split. 
> 
> MES is generally robust and seems to perform better than other criteria under a wide range of scenarios. It also allows flexibility in the asymmetrical distribution of responses, making it ideal for modelling such data. 
> 
> It's worth noting that splitting criteria such as Kullback-Leibler divergence are also used for similar purposes, and your final decision might depend on the specific problem context and data properties.
> 
> 2. R Package
> 
> The `party` or `partykit` packages in R allow users to specify a user-defined splitting criterion, although the implementation might be more complicated compared to the built-in methods. 
> 
> Here's an overview of how you might implement the MES (assuming you have a function for it) as a splitting criterion in the `party` package:
> 
> ```r
> party::ctree(Survival ~ Covariates, 
>              data = dat,
>              controls = party::ctree_control(splitfun = my_MES_function))
> ```
> 
> That said, building a random forest where the observations are distributions might require a non-trivial amount of coding and debugging. Such use cases might push the limits of the `party`/`partykit` packages, and there could be significant performance and computational costs as well.
> 
> You may want to consider transforming your data to a format more amenable to "out-of-the-box" random forest modelling (if it's possible and won't distort whatever phenomena you're studying). For example, having multiple records per "observation," each corresponding to individual measurements within the sampled distributions, could be an alternative approach. 
> 
> I hope this is a useful starting point. Customizing tree-based models at such a level of complexity can be challenging and exciting!
**user**:
> Are there any other functions I would need to override to allow these distributions-as-observations? Also, my distributions are univariate. Is MES still the most appropriate?
**assistant**:
> To allow distributions as observations in a random forest framework, you would need to override the splitting function and potentially a few other functions depending on the specific implementation you choose. In R, the `party` package provides a flexible framework for customizing tree-based models.
> 
> Here are the key functions you might need to override:
> 
> 1. `splitting()` or `splitstat()`: This function defines how the splitting criterion is computed. You would need to define your own splitting rule to evaluate the difference between distributions for each potential split. This is where the MES or a similar criterion would be implemented.
> 
> 2. `predict()` or `response()`: These functions determine how predictions are made using the trained model. Since your observations are distributions, you would need to define how the predictions are computed based on the distributions at each leaf node.
> 
> 3. `nodeapply()` or `nodeapplyfun()`: These functions control how the model traverses the tree, particularly when encountering new observations and deciding which child node to follow based on the splitting rule. Depending on your specific needs, you might need to modify these functions to handle the distributional observations appropriately.
> 
> Regarding the choice of the splitting rule, MES can still be considered a reasonable option for univariate distributions. It compares the energy distance between two distributions, which captures differences in shape, scale, and location. However, if you have specific characteristics or properties of your univariate distributions that make them significantly depart from a typical shape, you might explore other splitting criteria that are more tailored to your specific data.
> 
> For example, if your univariate distributions have heavy tails or are skewed, you might consider using a splitting rule based on quantile regression or quantile-quantile distances. These methods explicitly account for the shape and asymmetry of the distributions.
> 
> Ultimately, the choice of splitting criterion should be guided by the properties and characteristics of your univariate distributions. Experimentation and testing with different criteria can help identify the most appropriate approach for your specific data and modeling goals.
> 
> Remember, implementing custom tree-based models with distributional observations can be complex and may require careful consideration and testing. Be prepared for potential challenges and iterative development to achieve the desired functionality and performance.
