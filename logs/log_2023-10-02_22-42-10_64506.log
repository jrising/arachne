**user**:
> I am applying to a job at ETH Zurich and they want to know if my title is Dr. or Prof. or Dr. Prof. What is the difference?
**assistant**:
> In academia, the three titles Dr., Prof., and Dr. Prof. have distinct implications:
> 
> 1. **Dr.**: The title "Dr." is used when someone has completed a Doctorate degree (PhD). This signifies that the person has achieved the highest level of formal education in their field. For instance, in the case of a PhD, the person has committed to significant research and has made a new contribution of knowledge.
> 
> 2. **Prof.**: The title "Prof." is an abbreviation of "Professor," and is usually given to somebody who has a significant teaching role at a university or college, often coupled with conducting research. A professor generally has a PhD, but also has a continuing appointment at a university and contributes through teaching, research, and service. 
> 
> 3. **Dr. Prof.**: The term "Dr. Prof." is not very common globally, but is used in some European countries (like Germany and Switzerland). It combines the two titles mentioned above and it is usually granted to professors who also hold a doctorate. Unlike the "Prof." title, "Dr. Prof." signifies an individual who has not just obtained a doctorate but who also holds a professorship at a university.
> 
> In summary, while both "Dr." and "Prof." signal a high level of academic achievement, "Dr." emphasizes the completion of a Doctorate degree while "Prof." means a person holds a teaching position at a university. "Dr. Prof." indicates both.
> 
> For your application at ETH Zurich, if they have given you these options, you should choose the title that best fits your current qualifications and position.
**user**:
> Do any of these carry the expectation that I have secured tenure?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the title "Prof." typically carries the expectation that the individual has secured a tenured position at a university or college. Tenure is a permanent appointment that provides job security and academic freedom, allowing professors to engage in research, teaching, and service without the fear of arbitrary dismissal. Tenure is often granted based on a combination of factors, including research achievements, teaching effectiveness, and service to the academic community.
> 
> However, it's important to note that expectations and practices regarding tenure can vary between institutions and countries. Some countries may have different systems or titles to denote tenured positions. It's always a good idea to review the specific requirements and expectations of the institution you are applying to in order to accurately represent your qualifications and position.
