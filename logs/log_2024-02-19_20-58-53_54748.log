> February 20, 2024

> Mason-Maryland Energy and Climate-Tech Innovation Policy Boot Camp
> 
> Dear Drs. Hart and Kennedy,
> 
> I am very excited to apply to the 2024 Energy and Climate-Tech Innovation Policy Boot Camp. I was encouraged to apply by a former participant, Eugenie Dugoua. I am an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational modeler, with my work to-date focusing on climate change impacts. At the same time, my work to bridge disciplinary gaps has helped me develop strong relationships with the mitigation research community. I am particularly interested in this Boot Camp as an opportunity to evolve my career and better engage around policy solutions to climate change.
> 
> My research is on the interactions between economic and environmental systems, aimed at identifying policy opportunities for their effective management. My core research to-date has focused on the economic analysis of the risks of climate change, including improving impact and risk estimates, developing integrated models of climate policy, and grappling with risks that are currently missing from policy discussions. I draw upon quantitative techniques from multiple fields to develop systems perspectives. I also firmly believe that integrating multiple disciplines is essential addressing global issues, and regularly collaborate with climate scientists, process-based
> modelers, data scientists, and macroeconomists.
> 
> I have written or contributed to 26 published articles, including papers in both top natural science journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) and top economics journals (QJE, JAERE). Additionally, I produced five public reports, four as lead author. Relevant to this Boot Camp, I have written reports on loss & damage, on comparing mitigation costs and benefits, and on just energy transitions.
> 
> Perhaps my paper most relevant to the Boot Camp is Dumas et al. (2016), but since this is from several years ago (during my PhD), I will also describe my loss & damage research, which integrates elements across a wide range of my recent work. Dumas et al. develops a political economy model of renewable energy policy. The model posits a two-party system with different preferences over energy policy (“green” and “brown”) and explores optimal strategies for pursuing these preferences under election uncertainty. Interestingly, extremism on one side is a winning strategy since it pulls the more moderate party toward that view to avoid bad election outcomes.
> 
> Loss & damage is a key discussion point at the UNFCCC COPs, particularly the most recent ones. My recent report (released just before the last COP) developed country-level estimates of existing damages from climate change, in terms of how much poorer countries are today, relative to world without existing climate change. A centerpiece of this work is a meta-analysis of the econometric literature linking weather to GDP loss. This literature is currently fractious, with different assumptions leading to different results. I bring these together into a machine learning model to develop a “best-estimate” of the losses countries have experienced.
> 
> My recently published Science Policy Forum piece (“The costs of ‘costless’ climate mitigation”, Kotchen et al. 2023) also contributes to this literature, and highlights the gap between engineering and economic perspectives on mitigation policy.
> 
> Beyond my research, I have been an active member of the sustainable development community. I have been engaged in the work of closing gaps between academic work on climate risks and governance, by coordinating stakeholder and interdisciplinary researcher workshops and advising government and intergovernmental bodies such as the EPA, providing support around their update of the social cost of carbon; the CEA, informing their work to integrate climate into macroeconomic models; the UK’s Climate Change Committee, as a member of the new Economics Advisory Group; and IPBES, as a US representative to their activities around the Nature Futures Framework.
> 
> Moving forward, I hope to do research that is more relevant and timely for solving the challenges of climate change in the United States. Rapid decarbonization will require large-scale government and industry collaboration (e.g., around EV charging networks and carbon sequestration), well-designed transition policies (e.g., driving the replacement of fossil fuel plants), and a pipeline of startups to address an almost endless list of emerging economic and engineering issues. I believe that my background can support the development of the new energy ecosystem in several ways, as my research continues to evolve:
> -	My work in complex systems and spatiotemporal optimization provides an approach for bringing together energy system realities with real-world policy.
> -	Any transition needs to prove equitable and to plan for fossil-fuel-dependent workers and communities to garner the necessary support. My work on just transitions, including as a past leader of the Research Network on Energy Workforce Transitions, provides a basis for deeper addressing these issues.
> -	My pre-PhD background is in engineering and software development, connecting to the importance that climate-tech and innovation have in this boot camp.
> 
> While I believe I have a strong foundation for contributing to energy and climate-tech policy, my understanding of how these policies are actually made, who makes them, and how to inform and influence that process, remains poor. The Boot Camp is a perfect fit for the next step in my career development.

> 
> Dear Dr. Hart and Dr. Kennedy,
> 
> I am enthralled by the opportunity to apply for the 2024 Energy and Climate-Tech Innovation Policy Boot Camp. The commendation from Eugenie Dugoua, a former participant, further fueled my inclination. As an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational modeler, I've centered my work on the impacts of climate change. My endeavors in bridging disparate academic disciplines have fostered robust relationships within the mitigation research community. Therefore, I see the boot camp as a pivotal opportunity to further evolve my career and engender more effective policy solutions for climate change.
> 
> My core research delves into economic and environmental systems, aiming to pinpoint viable policy approaches for their efficacious management. I've focused specifically on the economic aspects of climate change risks, such as enhancing impact and risk estimates, integrating comprehensive climate policy models, and addressing overlooked, emerging risks in policy discourses. Utilizing a myriad of quantitative techniques from various fields, I mold a systems perspective that fosters interdisciplinary integration, as I firmly believe such integration is indispensable in resolving global issues.
> 
> In my career, I have contributed to 26 published articles in both distinguished natural science (Nature, Science, PNAS) and top-tier economics journals (QJE, JAERE). Additionally, I have produced five public reports, primarily as the lead author. More germane to this boot camp, I have penned reports on loss & damage, the costs and benefits of mitigation, and just energy transition strategies.
> 
> Two of my works could be particularly relevant to the boot camp. Firstly, Dumas et al. (2016) featured a political economy model exploring preferable strategies for renewable energy policy within a two-party system under election uncertainty. Intriguingly, it demonstrated that single-minded extremism pulls the more moderate party towards it as a winning strategy. Secondly, my recent report ahead of the last UNFCCC COP, developed country-level estimates of current damages from climate change, aiming to illustrate how much poorer nations are today, relative to a world without it. This report centralized a machine learning model that integrated contested econometric literature linking adverse weather to GDP loss.
> 
> Aside from my research, I actively collaborate within the sustainable development community, working to bridge the gap between academic work on climate risks and governance. For instance, I've coordinated stakeholder and interdisciplinary workshops and advised governmental and intergovernmental bodies including the EPA, CEA, the UK’s Climate Change Committee, and IPBES.
> 
> Looking ahead, I seek to conduct more directly applicable and contemporary research to help overcome climate change issues in the United States. Achieving rapid decarbonization is not a solitary task but will require effective collaboration between government and industry. Similarly, practical transition policies and a proactive startup pipeline are equally critical to counter the plethora of rising economic and engineering issues. With my pre-PhD background in engineering and software development, and research experience in complex systems, spatiotemporal optimization, and just transition approaches, I am confident that I can enrich the development of the new energy ecosystem.
> 
> Still, while I recognize the potential of my academic and professional backgrounds, I admit my lack of firsthand understanding of the policy-making process, its influencers, and how to effectively inform or shape it. This boot camp, therefore, represents an ideal platform for the necessary advancement of my career.
