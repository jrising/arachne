> To inform the findings of this study, the AdapTDR database first captured the overall return on each investment, including the net present values, internal rates of return, and benefit-cost ratios generated through cost-benefit analysis. For details, see Annex 2. Internal rates of return were the most commonly available indicator, provided for 264 out of the 320 adaptation investments included in the database.
> 
> The database also captured the composition and monetary values, when provided, of expected investment benefits across the three dividends defined in the TDR methodology. For more information, see Box 1. Benefits were categorized into one of the three dividends using standardized guidance to minimize variations in interpretation and classification, as shown in Figure 6.
> 
> Here is Figure 6, titled "Illustrative adaptation investment benefits by dividend."
> 
> In most cases, when an expected benefit was not monetized, this study did not try to calculate a value due to a lack of sufficiently detailed project data and transparency around assumptions. Instead, the database noted which benefits were monetized and which were not. However, this study developed a standardized methodology to estimate missing present values for carbon sequestration or greenhouse gas reduction benefits when identified and provided with sufficient data. Several projects, for example, estimated the total tons of CO2 equivalent to be sequestered or avoided through project activities but did not estimate the present value of those benefits.
> 
> Furthermore, the terms "monetized," "quantified," and "valued" are used interchangeably in this report. All refer to the concept of giving economic value to any project benefit, expressed in US dollars. There are many reasons why project appraisal documents might have more benefits than are monetized in the cost-benefit analysis. The methodology for valuing certain benefits may be difficult, the range of uncertainty may be high, and the level of benefits may already be sufficiently high that valuing further positive benefits wasn’t needed to gain project approval. AdapTDR notes which benefits for each project are valued and incorporated in the economic analysis and which are not.

> Now, here's a description of an image titled "Detailed Breakdown of Each of the Triple Dividends," which is organized into three main sections, each representing a type of dividend. Each section is color-coded with a distinct yellow-orange header.
> 
> The first dividend focuses on avoided losses, including increased mortality due to climate or environmental shocks, emergency health impacts, public infrastructure, and property loss or damage. Other losses include productivity or labor, yield, water, energy, and tourism, as well as increased travel time and rebuild or repair costs.
> 
> The second dividend covers induced economic and development benefits, such as employment gains, additional investment from reduced background risk, appreciation of property values, and productivity or labor gains beyond avoided losses. It also includes yield gains, water retention, energy gains, tourism gains, financial incentives, reduced travel time, and maintenance costs.
> 
> The third dividend presents additional environmental and social benefits, featuring greenhouse gas emissions reductions, health improvements, and improved habitats supporting biodiversity. It also includes recreational benefits, soil nutrient gains, water retention, and wellbeing benefits using the "WELLBY" method.
> 
> These sections outline specific benefits or losses associated with environmental and economic factors, emphasizing the multifaceted impacts of climate and environmental interventions.
