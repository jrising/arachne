> Climate change is a result of the externality associated with greenhouse-gas emissions –
> it entails costs that are not paid for by those who create the emissions.
> It has a number of features that together distinguish it from other externalities:
> It is global in its causes and consequences;
> The impacts of climate change are long-term and persistent;
> Uncertainties and risks in the economic impacts are pervasive.
> There is a serious risk of major, irreversible change with non-marginal economic
> effects.
> These features shape the economic analysis: it must be global, deal with long time horizons,
> have the economics of risk and uncertainty at its core, and examine the possibility of major,
> non-marginal changes.
> The impacts of climate change are very broad ranging and interact with other market
> failures and economic dynamics, giving rise to many complex policy problems. Ideas
> and techniques from most of the important areas of economics have to be deployed to
> analyse them, including many recent advances.
> The breadth, magnitude and nature of impacts imply that several ethical perspectives,
> such as those focusing on welfare, equity and justice, freedoms and rights, are
> relevant. Most of these perspectives imply that the outcomes of climate-change policy are to
> be understood in terms of impacts on consumption, health, education and the environment
> over time but different ethical perspectives may point to different policy recommendations.
> Questions of intra- and inter-generational equity are central. Climate change will have
> serious impacts within the lifetime of most of those alive today. Future generations will be
> even more strongly affected, yet they lack representation in present-day decisions.
> Standard externality and cost-benefit approaches have their usefulness for analysing
> climate change, but, as they are methods focused on evaluating marginal changes, and
> generally abstract from dynamics and risk, they can only be starting points for further work.
> Standard treatments of discounting are valuable for analysing marginal projects but
> are inappropriate for non-marginal comparisons of paths; the approach to discounting
> must meet the challenge of assessing and comparing paths that have very different
> trajectories and involve very long-term and large inter-generational impacts. We must go back
> to the first principles from which the standard marginal results are derived.
> The severity of the likely consequences and the application of the above analytical
> approaches form the basis of powerful arguments, developed in the Review, in favour
> of strong and urgent global action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and of major
> action to adapt to the consequences that now cannot be avoided.
> 2.1 Introduction
> The science described in the previous chapter drives the economics that is required for the
> analysis of policy. This chapter introduces the conceptual frameworks that we will use to
> examine the economics of climate change. It explores, in Section 2.2, the distinctive features
> of the externalities associated with greenhouse-gas emissions and draws attention to some of
> the difficulties associated with a simplistic application of the standard theory of externalities to
> this problem. Section 2.3 introduces a variety of ethical approaches and relates them to the

> global and long-term nature of the impacts (the discussion is extended in the appendix to the
> chapter). Section 2.4 examines some specifics of intertemporal allocation, including
> discounting (some further technical details are provided in the appendix to the chapter).
> Sections 2.5 and 2.6 consider how economic analysis can get to grips with a problem that is
> uncertain and involves a serious risk of large losses of wellbeing, due to deaths, extinctions of
> species and heavy economic costs, rather than the marginal changes more commonly
> considered in economics. For most of economic policy, the underlying ethical assumptions
> are of great importance, and this applies particularly for climate change: that is why they are
> given special attention in this chapter.
> The economics introduced in this chapter applies, in principle, to the whole Review but the
> analysis of Sections 2.2 to 2.6 is of special relevance to Parts II and III, which look at impacts
> and at the economics of mitigation – assessing how much action is necessary to reduce
> greenhouse-gas emissions. Parts IV, V, VI of this report are devoted to the analysis of policy
> to promote mitigation and adaptation. The detailed, and often difficult, economics of public
> policy and collective action that are involved in these analyses are introduced in the sections
> themselves and we provided only brief coverage in Sections 2.7 and 2.8. In the former
> section, we refer briefly to the modern public economics of carbon taxation, trading and
> regulation and of the promotion of research, development and deployment, including the
> problems of various forms of market imperfection affecting innovation. It also covers an
> analysis of the role of ‘responsible behaviour’ and how public understanding of this notion
> might be influenced by public policy. Section 2.8 explores some of the difficulties of building
> and sustaining global collective action in response to the global challenge of climate change.
> In these ways, this chapter lays the analytical foundations for much of the economics required
> by the challenge of climate change and which is put to work in the course of the analysis
> presented in this Review.
> The subject demands analysis across an enormous range of issues and requires all the tools
> of economics we can muster – and indeed some we wish we had. In setting out some of
> these tools, some of the economic analysis of this chapter is inevitably technical, even though
> the more mathematical material has been banished to an appendix. Some readers less
> interested in the technical underpinnings of the analysis may wish to skim the more formal
> analytical material. Nevertheless, it is important to set out some of the analytical instruments
> at the beginning of the Review, since they underpin the analysis of risk, equity and allocation
> over time that must lie at the heart of a serious analysis of the economics of climate change.
> 2.2 Understanding the market failures that lead to climate change
> Climate change results from greenhouse-gas emissions associated with economic
> activities including energy, industry, transport and land use.
> In common with many other environmental problems, human-induced climate change is at its
> most basic level an externality. Those who produce greenhouse-gas emissions are bringing
> about climate change, thereby imposing costs on the world and on future generations, but
> they do not face directly, neither via markets nor in other ways, the full consequences of the
> costs of their actions.
> Much economic activity involves the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). As GHGs
> accumulate in the atmosphere, temperatures increase, and the climatic changes that result
> impose costs (and some benefits) on society. However, the full costs of GHG emissions, in
> terms of climate change, are not immediately – indeed they are unlikely ever to be – borne by
> the emitter, so they face little or no economic incentive to reduce emissions. Similarly,
> emitters do not have to compensate those who lose out because of climate change.1 In this
> sense, human-induced climate change is an externality, one that is not ‘corrected’ through
> any institution or market,2 unless policy intervenes.
> 1 Symmetrically, those who benefit from climate change do not have to reward emitters.

> The climate is a public good: those who fail to pay for it cannot be excluded from enjoying its
> benefits and one person’s enjoyment of the climate does not diminish the capacity of others to
> enjoy it too.3 Markets do not automatically provide the right type and quantity of public goods,
> because in the absence of public policy there are limited or no returns to private investors for
> doing so: in this case, markets for relevant goods and services (energy, land use, innovation,
> etc) do not reflect the consequences of different consumption and investment choices for the
> climate. Thus, climate change is an example of market failure involving externalities and
> public goods.4 Given the magnitude and nature of the effects initially described in the previous
> chapter and taken forward in Parts II and III, it has profound implications for economic growth
> and development. All in all, it must be regarded as market failure on the greatest scale the
> world has seen.
> The basic theory of externalities and public goods is the starting point for most economic
> analyses of climate change and this Review is no exception. The starting point embodies the
> basic insights of Pigou, Meade, Samuelson and Coase (see Part IV). But the special features
> of this particular externality demand, as we shall see, that the economic analysis go much
> further.
> The science of climate change means that this is a very different form of externality
> from the types commonly analysed.
> Climate change has special features that, together, pose particular challenges for the
> standard economic theory of externalities. There are four distinct issues that will be
> considered in turn in the sections below.
> Climate change is an externality that is global in both its causes and consequences.
> The incremental impact of a tonne of GHG on climate change is independent of
> where in the world it is emitted (unlike other negative impacts such as air pollution
> and its cost to public health), because GHGs diffuse in the atmosphere and because
> local climatic changes depend on the global climate system. While different countries
> produce different volumes the marginal damage of an extra unit is independent of
> whether it comes from the UK or Australia.
> The impacts of climate change are persistent and develop over time. Once in the
> atmosphere, some GHGs stay there for hundreds of years. Furthermore, the climate
> system is slow to respond to increases in atmospheric GHG concentrations and there
> are yet more lags in the environmental, economic and social response to climate
> change. The effects of GHGs are being experienced now and will continue to work
> their way through in the very long term.
> The uncertainties are considerable, both about the potential size, type and timing of
> impacts and about the costs of combating climate change; hence the framework used
> must be able to handle risk and uncertainty.
> The impacts are likely to have a significant effect on the global economy if action is
> not taken to prevent climate change, so the analysis has to consider potentially non-
> marginal changes to societies, not merely small changes amenable to ordinary
> project appraisal.
> These features shape much of the detailed economic analysis throughout this Review. We
> illustrate with just one example, an important one, which shows how the dynamic nature of
> the accumulation of GHGs over time affects one of the standard analytical workhorses of the
> economics of externalities and the environment. It is common to present policy towards
> climate change in terms of the social cost of carbon on the margin (SCC) and the marginal
> abatement (MAC). The former is the total damage from now into the indefinite future of
> emitting an extra unit of GHGs now – the science says that GHGs (particularly CO2) stay in
> the atmosphere for a very long time. Thus, in its simplest form, the nature of the problem is
> that the stock of gases in the atmosphere increases with the net flow of GHGs emissions in
> this period, and thus decreases with abatement. Therefore, on the one hand, the SCC curve

> slopes downwards with increasing abatement in any given period, assuming that the lower
> the stock at any point in the future, the less the marginal damage. On the other hand, the

> climate change, and, also, because in so doing we can learn something about how to apply
> the more standard economic approach. There is a growing literature on the ethics of climate
> change: analysis of policy cannot avoid grappling directly with the difficult issues that arise.
> These ethical frameworks are discussed more formally in the technical appendix to this

> .
> The underlying ethics of basic welfare economics, which underpins much of the standard
> analysis of public policy, focuses on the consequences of policy for the consumption of goods
> and services by individuals in a community. These goods and services are generated by
> labour, past saving, knowledge and natural resources. The perspective sees individuals as

> In this approach, the objective is to work out the policies that would be set by a decision-
> maker acting on behalf of the community and whose role it is to improve, or maximise, overall
> social welfare. This social welfare depends on the welfare of each individual in the
> community. When goods and services are defined in a broad way, they can include, for
> example, education, health and goods appearing at different dates and in different
> circumstances. Thus the theory covers time and uncertainty. And, to the extent that
> individuals value the environment, that too is part of the analysis. Many goods or services,
> including education, health and the environment, perform a dual role: individuals directly value
> them and they are inputs into the use or acquisition of other consumption goods. In the
> jargon, they are both goals and instruments.
> The standard economic theory then focuses on flows of goods or services over time and their
> distribution across individuals. The list of goods or services should include consumption
> (usually monetary or the equivalent), education, health and the environment. These are
> usually the areas focused upon in cross-country comparisons of living standards, such as, for
> example, in the World Development Indicators of the World Bank, the Human Development
> Report of the UNDP, and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) agreed at the UN at the
> turn of the millennium. ‘Stocks’ of wealth, infrastructure, the natural environment and so on
> enter into the analysis in terms of their influence on flows. Through these choices of data for
> central attention and through the choice of goals, the international community has identified a
> strong and shared view on the key dimensions of human well-being.
> Those choices of data and goals can be derived from a number of different ethical
> perspectives (see, for example, Sen (1999)). Most ethical frameworks generally used in the
> analyses of economic policy have some relevance for the economics of climate change and
> 5 Particularly important contributions on ethics are those of Beckerman and Pasek (2001), Broome (1992, 1994,

> 2.5 Risk and Uncertainty

> hence the analytical framework should be able to handle risk and uncertainty explicitly.
> For the moment, we do not make a distinction between risk and uncertainty, but the

> economics.
> The basis of such probabilities should be up-to-date knowledge from science and economics.
> This amounts to a ‘subjective’ probability approach.10 It is a pragmatic response to the fact
> that many of the ‘true’ uncertainties around climate-change policy cannot themselves be
> observed and quantified precisely, as they can be in many engineering problems, for
> example.
> The standard expected-utility framework involves aversion to risk and in this narrow
> sense a ‘precautionary principle’.
> This approach to uncertainty, combined with the assumption that the social marginal utility of
> income declines as income rises, implies that society will be willing to pay a premium
> (insurance) to avoid a simple actuarially fair gamble where potential losses and gains are
> large. As Parts II and III show, potential losses from climate change are large and the costs of

> 2.7 The public policy of promoting mitigation

> IV is devoted to policy to bring it about. The basic theory of externalities identifies the source
> of the economic problem in untaxed or unpriced emissions of GHGs.
> The externality requires a price for emissions: that is the first task of mitigation policy.
> The first task of policy is therefore to introduce taxes or prices for GHGs. The Pigou treatment
> of externalities points to taxes based on the marginal damages caused by carbon emissions.
> In the diagram shown in Figure 2.1, the appropriate tax would be equal to the social cost of
> carbon at the point where it is equal to the marginal abatement cost. Faced with this tax, the
> emitters would choose the appropriate level of abatement.
> However, the modern theory of risk indicates that long-term quantity targets may be the right
> direction for policy, with trading within those targets or regular revision of taxes to keep on
> course towards the long-run objective (see Chapter 14). Given the long-run nature of many of
> the relevant decisions, whichever policies are chosen, credibility and predictability of policy
> will be crucial to effectiveness.
