**user**:
> I am using the coqui TTS system to synthesize speech. What is the best way to make this generated speech go through the audio speakers? Also, if it matters, I want to generate speech for many sentences which will be generated as I play them, so I want to make sure there's as little latency as possible.
**assistant**:
> In order to use the output audio from Coqui TTS and play it through the speakers in real-time, you have a few options depending on your system and programming language. 
> 
> If you're using Python, a combination of Coqui's TTS system and a package like `pydub` can be used to achieve this. Here's a simple example:
> 
> ```python
> from TTS.tts import tts
> from pydub import AudioSegment
> from pydub.playback import play
> import io
> 
> # create your TTS model here
> # TTS_MODEL = …
> 
> def synthesize_and_play(text):
>     # Synthesize the text
>     wav_bytes = tts(TTS_MODEL, text)
>     
>     # Convert the bytes to an AudioSegment 
>     audio = AudioSegment.from_file(io.BytesIO(wav_bytes), format="wav")
>     
>     # Play the audio
>     play(audio)
> ```
> You can then call this function with the text you want to synthesize as the argument. 
> 
> If you are concerned with latency, you'll want to consider running the real-time speech generation in its own CPU process or GPU if applicable, so it doesn't block the main thread of your application. This will allow your application to continue processing while the speech is being synthesized.
> 
> Please note that Coqui TTS will depend on your system specifications and how complex the underlying model is. Advanced models may take more time to generate the speech.

**user**:
> I get the error from io.BytesIO(wav_bytes) that TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'list'
> 
**assistant**:
> I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `tts` function from Coqui TTS is returning a list of bytes instead of a single byte object. To resolve the error, you can convert the list of bytes into a single byte object before passing it to `io.BytesIO`. Here's an updated code snippet:
> 
> ```python
> from TTS.tts import tts
> from pydub import AudioSegment
> from pydub.playback import play
> import io
> 
> # create your TTS model here
> # TTS_MODEL = …
> 
> def synthesize_and_play(text):
>     # Synthesize the text
>     wav_bytes = tts(TTS_MODEL, text)
>     
>     # Convert the list of bytes to a single byte object
>     wav_byte_array = bytes().join(wav_bytes)
>     
>     # Convert the byte object to an AudioSegment 
>     audio = AudioSegment.from_file(io.BytesIO(wav_byte_array), format="wav")
>     
>     # Play the audio
>     play(audio)
> ```
> 
> With this update, the list of bytes (`wav_bytes`) is joined together into a single byte object (`wav_byte_array`) using the `bytes().join()` method. This byte object is then used to create the `AudioSegment` and played through the speakers using `pydub`.
> 
> Please give this updated code a try, and let me know if you encounter any further issues.
