> how does this program with the UN 17 development goals? "he program that we are seeking support for is The Building Innovation Hub, focused on improving the built environment in the DC metropolitan area. The Hub strives to contribute to the economic and social development of these communities, fostering sustainable growth and resilience.The Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS) are part of the District’s efforts to achieve its green building and climate goals outlined in the Clean Energy DC Plan. This plan sets actions for private industry and the government to reach ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets by 2032. Since buildings account for 71% of DC’s GHG emissions, reducing the amount of energy used in buildings is essential to achieve climate commitments.

> This program aligns with several of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically:
> 
> **SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy** - By reducing energy costs and consumption in frontline communities and increasing energy efficiency in building stock, the program directly contributes to this goal.
> 
> **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** - The program promotes sustainable economic growth by striving to make improvements in the built environment. It not only reduces costs but also enables potential job creation in green technology sectors. 
> 
> **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure** - The Building Innovation Hub ensures resilient infrastructure and fosters innovation in the building industry, which is essential for sustainable development.
> 
> **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** - With a focus on improving the built environment, this program prescribes resilient buildings as crucial components of sustainable and resilient cities. 
> 
> **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** - Encouraging energy efficiency ultimately leads to more sustainable consumption and production patterns.
> 
> **SDG 13: Climate Action** - By committing to meet ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, the program is directly responding to the urgent call to combat climate change and its impacts, thus playing a leading role in global climate action. 
> 
> Through all these activities, the program is inadvertently also contributing to **SDG 1: No Poverty**, **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**, **SDG 4: Quality Education**, and **SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities**, by helping to improve quality of life, reduce costs, and create a more equitable future.
