**assistant**:
> You can do matrix multiplication in Python using the NumPy library. Here is an example:
> 
> ```python
> import numpy as np
> 
> # Initialize matrices
> A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
> B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
> 
> # Multiply matrices
> mult_result = np.dot(A, B)
> 
> print(mult_result)
> ```
> 
> The `np.dot()` function returns the dot product of two arrays. For 2-D arrays like the matrices in this example, it returns the matrix multiplication.
> 
> Please make sure the inner dimensions of your matrices match for multiplication. If you're multiplying an `(m x n)` matrix with an `(n x p)` matrix, you'll get an `(m x p)` matrix. The number of columns in the first matrix (`n` in this example) should match the number of rows in the second matrix. Otherwise, the multiplication can't be performed.
