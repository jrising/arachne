> How do I replace NAs with 0's in an R data frame across just some of its columns, in dplyr?
**assistant**:
> To replace `NA` values with 0 in specific columns of a data frame using `dplyr`, you can use the `mutate()` function combined with `across()`. This allows you to specify which columns to modify and apply a transformation function to those columns. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```r
> library(dplyr)
> 
> # Example data frame
> df <- data.frame(
>   A = c(1, NA, 3),
>   B = c(NA, 2, 3),
>   C = c(4, 5, NA)
> )
> 
> # Replace NAs with 0 in columns A and B only
> df_modified <- df %>%
>   mutate(across(c(A, B), ~replace_na(., 0)))
> 
> print(df_modified)
> ```
> 
> In this code snippet, `across(c(A, B), ~replace_na(., 0))` specifies that the function `replace_na(., 0)` should be applied to columns A and B. The tilde `~` is used to create an anonymous function that passes each column to the `replace_na()` function, which replaces `NA` values with 0. Make sure that the `tidyverse` package is installed and loaded to use `replace_na()`.
