> I have used Vensim for a long time to do system dynamics modeling. I will now be teaching a class where I want students to be able to do this. Is Vensim still the right tool for the job? I see that it still exists and is free.
**assistant**:
> Vensim is certainly a viable choice for teaching system dynamics modeling. It is user-friendly and its free PLE (Personal Learning Edition) version is enough for students to learn system dynamics basics. That said, it's worth considering some other options that might offer a more contemporary environment for system dynamics modeling:
> 
> 1. **Stella:** These modeling software is also widely used in education and comes with a more intuitive, visual interface. The downside is the cost - while Vensim offers a free version, Stella does not. There is an academic discount, but it still represents a cost to the students.
> 
> 2. **InsightMaker:** This is a free, web-based tool that is well suited to educational contexts. It supports system dynamics modeling and offers multi-user real-time collaboration and sharing capabilities, and also has features to support agent-based modeling. 
> 
> 3. **AnyLogic:** AnyLogic is a very powerful simulation tool that supports system dynamics, agent-based, and discrete event simulations. It offers a free personal learning edition and has a steep learning curve but is excellent for complex and advanced models.
> 
> Before making a choice, consider the specific needs of your class. If the focus is going to be purely on system dynamics, Vensim could be a simple, effective option. If you plan to include other types of modeling (such as agent-based models), a more versatile tool like AnyLogic or InsightMaker may be preferable.
> 
> Finally, consider the computer literacy of your students. Vensim's interface is not as flashy as some other tools, but it also has fewer opportunities to trip up beginners. More complex software could potentially be off-putting for students who are not as technically inclined.
> 
> In conclusion, Vensim can still be the right tool for teaching system dynamics modeling, but it could be worthwhile for you to explore some other options based on the specific needs of your class.

> Does InsightMaker have the concept of an "out of the system cloud symbol" that Vensim uses to denote flows into or out of stocks that do not come from other stocks?
**assistant**:
> No, InsightMaker does not have a specific "out of the system cloud symbol" like the one used in Vensim to represent flows into or out of stocks that do not come from other stocks. In InsightMaker, flows are typically directly connected to stocks through arrows or links.
> 
> However, you can still model flows that do not come from other stocks in InsightMaker by connecting them directly to the stock, using either directed or bidirectional links. You can label the links to clarify that they signify inputs from outside the system.
> 
> While the terminology and visual representation may differ, InsightMaker still allows you to represent and model external inflows and outflows effectively.
