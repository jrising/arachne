> Motivation letter First, I would like to express my appreciation for this opportunity to apply for PhD scholarship. I am a graduate of MSc degree in Agricultural Economics. Taking into consideration the background knowledge I have in climate change, enhancing the value of agricultural commodity have crucial contribution in the development and sustainable poverty reduction in Ethiopia and I strongly feel that a PhD in Agricultural Economics will be very relevant to my job back here in my country. My potential employer, Bule Hora University is the only state university that is working in a community based teaching learning process and it will be a good channel where I can transfer the knowledge gained in an optimized manner to my country and future generations. Like other developing countries, Ethiopia is dependent on the export earning of agricultural potential, to overcome obstacles and to achieve their goals. While working in the public sector we all strive for positive changes in our society. I am sure all changes we want in society have to start with NGO and ourselves. I shall develop national programs, which could help to adjust long-term relations among cultures and continents. This is my way, the way of a person who wants, for certain, to change the fortune of Ukraine and its’ folk. I am a drop of my Ethiopian people and the fortune of all the ocean depends on my personal experience, knowledge which I can and want to pass the other people. I want to conduct my thesis on Determinants of Farmers’ willingness to participate on soil and watershed conservation practice. In conclusion, I would like to say that I am eager to gain new experiences, improve my skills and broaden my understanding of the dynamic economic world, and I am persuaded that studying in the PhD in Agricultural Economics Program would contribute to my development as a specialist of international level in the best possible way. Thank you very much for considering my application. Yours faithfully, Haile Tamiru
