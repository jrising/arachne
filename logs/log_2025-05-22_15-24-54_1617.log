**assistant**:
> It sounds like you're dealing with a situation where `page.goto(url)` or `page.content()` is potentially causing a hang in your async function due to specific errors that aren't being handled effectively. Here are a few approaches to address this:
> 
> 1. **Increase the Timeout**: Occasionally, pages take longer to load than expected, so you might want to adjust the timeout value.
> 
> 2. **Try-Catch for Await**: If there's a possibility of network issues or navigation errors, wrapping each await in a try-catch block can help capture those exceptions:

>     async def fetch_url(page, url):
>         try:
>             try:
>                 response = await page.goto(url, {'timeout': 30000})
>             except Exception as goto_err:
>                 print(f"Error during page.goto: {goto_err}")
>                 return None, None
>             
>             try:
>                 content = await page.content()
>             except Exception as content_err:
>                 print(f"Error during page.content: {content_err}")
>                 return None, None
>             
>             content_type = response.headers.get('content-type', '') if response else ''
>             return content, content_type
>         except Exception as ex:
>             print(f"Unexpected error: {ex}")
>             return None, None
>     ```

> 3. **Use `page.waitForNavigation()`**: If the page.goto seems to complete but hangs perhaps due to redirects or subsequent loads, try using `await page.waitForNavigation({'timeout': 10000})` after your `.goto()`.
> 
> 4. **Diagnostics and Logs**: Printing out logs or using try-catch-with-logging can provide more context around where it fails, so always log caught exceptions to understand better what might be going wrong.
> 
> 5. **Debugging**: Run it with logging enabled to see further down what might be leading to the hang. Puppeteer's debugging flag (`PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=path-to-chromium`) or headless mode switched off might also provide visual insights.

> By implementing these strategies, particularly the separate try-catch blocks around each await, you'll get more specific error handling and hopefully prevent script hanging due to undiagnosed issues.
