**assistant**:
> I would be happy to help you draft a corporate giving policy. However, I'll need a little more information to make the policy fit your company's goals and values. Here are some questions that would help:
> 
> 1. What is the mission and vision of your company? Are there any specific causes or types of organizations that align with these values that you want to support?
> 2. Do you have a specific budget set aside for corporate giving, or will it vary by year or profit margin?
> 3. Will you provide cash donations, in-kind donations, sponsorships, or a mix?
> 4. How often will you distribute donations, and how will you choose the beneficiaries?
> 5. Do you want to incorporate employee giving or volunteering into the policy?
> 6. Finally, how will you evaluate the impact of your donations, both for the beneficiaries and your company?
> 
> Once you've started to think about these questions, we can formulate a more detailed policy.
