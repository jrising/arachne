> My parents will be coming to take care of my kids in a few weeks. What do I need to do to make sure that they can take them to the doctor/dentist if needed-- and other things like that?
**assistant**:
> It's great that your parents will be helping out! Here are some steps you can take to ensure they have everything they need to take care of your kids, including any medical or dental visits:
> 
> 1. **Medical Authorization Form**: Provide your parents with a written authorization form that grants them the authority to seek medical or dental care for your kids. This document should include:
>    - The full names and birthdates of your children.
>    - Your full names and contact information.
>    - Your parents' full names and contact information.
>    - Specific authorization language that allows them to make healthcare decisions.
>    - Your signatures, dated.
>    - Notarization, if possible, as some institutions may require it for added legal validity.
> 
> 2. **Insurance Cards**: Make sure your parents have copies of your children’s health and dental insurance cards, including the front and back.
> 
> 3. **Medical Information**: Provide a list of your children's medical information, including:
>    - Any known allergies.
>    - Current medications and dosages.
>    - Primary care physician and dentist contact information.
>    - Copies of recent medical and dental records, if possible.
> 
> 4. **Important Contacts**: Create a list of emergency contacts and important phone numbers, including:
>    - Local hospital and urgent care centers.
>    - Poison control hotline.
>    - Your contact information and a secondary contact (e.g., a trusted neighbor or friend).
> 
> 5. **Routine Schedule**: If your kids have a set routine for medications or other health-related activities, provide a detailed schedule.
> 
> 6. **Childcare Essentials**: Ensure your parents know where to find essential items, such as:
>    - First aid kit.
>    - Emergency numbers.
>    - Important documents (birth certificates, social security cards, etc.).
> 
> 7. **Legal Guardianship**: If you'll be gone for an extended period, consider talking to a lawyer about a temporary guardianship agreement that grants your parents broader authority over the children's care.
> 
> By preparing these documents and information in advance, you can ensure that your parents have everything they need to make informed decisions and take the best care of your kids while you’re away.
