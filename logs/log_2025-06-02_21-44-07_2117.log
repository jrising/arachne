> I want to test something using "multi-level logistic regression modeling" in R. Specifically, I have a situation where several respondents are offered prices, and select how much of something they want to sell. I would normally just regress amount sold on price, but a student has done this instead treating every "sell amount" as a different observation, and then regressing the binary indicator of whether a given sell amount was selected against the price and the sell amount. This seems wrong to me, but I want to test it and see if, for example, the inclusion of all of those extra observations makes artificially small standard errors when this is done in a random effects setup. Can you lay this out in R?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! You can use multi-level logistic regression modeling in R with the `lme4` package, which allows you to model binary outcomes with random effects.
> 
> Your hypothesis is that the approach of treating each "sell amount" as a separate observation could lead to artificially small standard errors by inflating the sample size with non-independent observations. Here's a simple example of how you might set up and test this:
> 
> 1. **Simulate Data**: Create a dataset that matches the description, with respondents, prices, and sell amounts.
> 
> 2. **Fit a Proper Model**: Model the data using the `glmer` function, which is appropriate for multi-level (mixed-effects) logistic regression.
> 
> 3. **Fit the Student's Model**: Emulate the student's approach and include random effects.
> 
> 4. **Compare Results**: Compare standard errors and model performance between the two approaches.

**user**:
> Okay, but with the "proper approach", we don't regress against the choices, just against the sell_amo
**assistant**:
> Got it! If your aim is to examine the impact of `sell_amount` directly while using a multi-level logistic regression model and you want to exclude the binary `choices` variable in the model, you can structure your models like this:
> 
> 1. **Model the `sell_amount` as the response variable** in the context of a multi-level structure based on `respondents` and prices.
> 2. **Compare** this model to the student’s method.

> 
> # Create proper data frame
> proper_data <- data.frame(respondents, prices, sell_amounts, choices)
> 
> # Proper approach: Model the response (sell amount) directly against prices
> # Assuming sell_amount is the outcome we want to model
> proper_model <- glmer(sell_amounts ~ prices + (1 | respondents),
>                        data = proper_data,
>                        family = poisson)  # Using Poisson for count data
> 
> # Student's approach: Treat every sell amount as a separate binary observation
> student_model <- glmer(choices ~ prices + sell_amounts + (1 | respondents),
>                        data = proper_data,
>                        family = binomial)

> cat("\n### Student's Model Summary ###\n")
> summary(student_model)
> 
> # Compare standard errors
> compare_standard_errors <- data.frame(
>   Variable = c("Intercept", "Price", "SellAmount"),
>   Proper_SE = summary(proper_model)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"],
>   Student_SE = NA  # Since SellAmount is not included in the proper model
> )
> 
> ## For Student's model, getting parameters realted only to prices + response 
> student_params <- summary(student_model)$coefficients
> 
> compare_standard_errors$Student_SE[1] <- student_params["(Intercept)", "Std. Error"]
> compare_standard_errors$Student_SE[2] <- student_params["prices", "Std. Error"]
> # Only price in proper model comparison
> print(compare_standard_errors)
> ```
> 
> ### Key Changes Made:
> 
> 1. **Adjusted the response variable**: The `proper_model` now models `sell_amounts` directly against `prices`, with random effects for `respondents`. Since you indicated that you're not using `choices` in this context, the model is adjusted accordingly.
> 
> 2. **Family Specification**: I used `family = poisson` in the `proper_model` for count data, assuming that `sell_amounts` are counts. Adjust this as necessary for your actual data.
> 
> 3. **Error Comparison**: The code measures standard errors for both models and compiles them in a data frame for comparison.
> 
> Now you can analyze the result and assess the model fit, coefficients, and standard errors to see if the inclusion method employed by the student artificially alters standard errors. Let me know if you have further questions or need more adjustments!
