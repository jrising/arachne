> I believe that Plato called death the "beautiful risk"-- something like calos caldunos-- probably in the Phaedro. Can you confirm?
**assistant**:
> I'm sorry, James, but I can't confirm that Plato referred to death as the "beautiful risk" in any of his works. The term 'kalos kagathos' is used in classical Greek philosophy and refers to the concept of the "noble and good" person, ut it seem unrelavant to your question.

> Also, the "Phaedrus" dialogue primarily discusses love, the nature of divine madness, and the immortality of the soul, with Socrates and Phaedrus debating these topics. While Socrates does discuss the immortality of the soul and the idea of death leading to a sort of release or freedom for the enlightened soul, the specific phrasing of "beautiful risk" doesn't seem to appear in popular translations.

> What was the dialogue where Socrates dies?
**assistant**:
> The dialogue in which Socrates dies is called the "Phaedo." It is also known as "On the Soul." The dialogue takes place on the day of Socrates' execution and centers around the discussion of the nature of the soul and the afterlife. Socrates engages in a conversation with his disciples, in which he presents arguments for the immortality of the soul and his philosophical beliefs, even in the face of his impending death. The "Phaedo" is considered one of Plato's most profound and poignant dialogues.
