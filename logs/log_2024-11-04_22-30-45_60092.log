> Dear Prof. James Rising,
>  
> My name is Yuhui Zhai, I am writing this email to inquire about potential PhD supervision opportunities in your department, and focus my research area in carbon emissions, environmental policy and management, and the application of machine learning for environmental analysis. I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in Energy Systems at National University of Singapore under the guidance of Professor Ang Beng Wah, and am expected to obtain the degree by June 2025. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science at Tongji University from 2019 to 2023, where I received several awards, including the Gold Award at the WUPEN International Urban Sustainable Development Competition and the Tongji University Kent-Yangqin Environmental Education Award. I am eager to study for a Ph.D. at University of Delaware and after researching your work and recent publications, would like to request the opportunity of possible study under your supervision.
> 
> I have been actively involved in research, including a current project applying methodologies such as benchmarking analysis and LMDI decomposition to assess the impact of power generation efficiency, geographical shift effects, and non-fossil fuel contributions on carbon emissions. Additionally, I recently completed a research project evaluating the carbon emission capacity of municipal solid waste disposal in the Yangtze River Economic Belt and served as a research assistant at Tsinghua University, where I contributed to developing cooperation scenarios and analytical models for sustainable energy deployment.
>  
> In 2021 and 2023, I have published two SCI papers, titled "Simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals from aqueous phase via adsorptive strategy: A critical review" and "Research Progress on Analytical Methods of Microplastics in Environmental Water Body."
>  
> I also interned in the R&D Department of Wuhan Carbon Inclusive Management Co., Ltd, where I collaborated with the team to comprehensively analyze national carbon-inclusive policies and methodologies. This involved synthesizing relevant data and trends to support the development of effective carbon management strategies.
>  
> Given my academic background and research interests, I am eager to specialize in carbon emissions, environmental policy and management, and the application of machine learning for environmental analysis. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss potential PhD supervision under your guidance and explore how my research interests align with your work. I have attached my CV and research proposal titled "Evaluation and Analysis of Carbon Emission Capacity of Municipal Solid Waste Disposal in the Yangtze River Economic Belt" for your review. I hope to discuss potential PhD supervision under your guidance and explore if there might be space for new PhD students.
>  
> Thank you for considering my inquiry. I look forward to your response.

**assistant**:
> Yuhui Zhai's email indicates a strong interest in pursuing a Ph.D. with a focus on carbon emissions, environmental policy and management, and machine learning applications for environmental analysis. Having completed a Bachelor's in Environmental Science at Tongji University with notable awards, and currently pursuing a Master’s in Energy Systems at the National University of Singapore, Yuhui seems well-qualified, especially with research and publications relating to environmental sustainability and carbon management. There are no specific questions asked in the email, and the applicant seems unaware of the specific Ph.D. program choices within your department. I'll suggest directing them to the program identification form and address any specifics about their interest and potential fit with your research. Here's a draft response:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Yuhui Zhai,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and providing details about your impressive background. Your research interests in carbon emissions, environmental policy, and machine learning sound compelling and well-aligned with the work we undertake here at the University of Delaware.
> 
> We are currently using a new system to help prospective students like yourself connect with potential advisors and identify the best program fit. Please fill out this form:

> 
> If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environment Science and Management, which aligns closely with your background and expertise, I encourage you to apply by December 1 for full consideration. While funding is limited, your background suggests potential for engaging in quantitative work related to climate change risks and interdisciplinary modeling, which are central to my own research. Mentioning my name in your statement of purpose could be beneficial when it aligns with your research goals.
> 
> Thank you again for considering the University of Delaware for your doctoral studies. I look forward to seeing how your interests could contribute to our academic community.
