> I would like to read a file line by line in R, until I see a certain line and then read the rest as a CSV. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> Reading a file until a certain line, then treating the rest as a CSV is a bit unconventional, but it can be done using some base R functions.

> Here's an example:

> ```R
> # Load the required package
> library(readr)
> 
> # Specify the file 
> file <- "yourfile.txt"
> 
> # Read in the lines of the file
> lines <- readLines(file)
> 
> # Find the line of interest
> startLine <- grep("your specific line content", lines)
> 
> # Ensure that line exists in the file
> if(length(startLine) == 0){
>   stop("Specified line not found in the file")
> }
> 
> # Read the rest as a CSV 
> data <- read_csv(file, skip = startLine)
> ```

> `readLines` allows you to read in all lines of a file as character strings. `grep` is a function that can help locate the index of a line with certain content. `read_csv` can then read the file starting from a certain line. All this offers the functionality required for your task. Remember to install the 'readr' package (`install.packages("readr")`) in case you haven't installed it.
