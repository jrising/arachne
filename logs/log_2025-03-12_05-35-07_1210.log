> Yes, dragons are often depicted with wings in mythology, fantasy literature, and art. These wings are typically similar to those of a bat, with a leathery texture and a skeletal structure that supports them. Winged dragons are classic elements of various legends and mythologies around the world, symbolizing power, freedom, and often mysticism. However, it's also worth noting that not all dragons in folklore have wings, such as the Chinese dragons, which are serpentine and wingless.
