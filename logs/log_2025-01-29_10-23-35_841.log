> As an AI, I can't provide real-time news updates. However, as of my most recent training data from September 2021, corporations had already begun to adjust their grant making and funding strategies in response to political developments, including those associated with the Trump administration.
> 
> The changes during Trump's administration and its aftermath have varied across corporations based on their level of exposure to targeted regulations, overall corporate strategy, public opinion, and other factors. That said, a few general trends were apparent:
> 
> 1. **Increased funding for environmental and social governance (ESG) matters:** Some corporations increased their focus on ESG initiatives amid growing public and investor concerns about climate change, inequality, and other challenges. This includes funding for sustainable and local development projects, diversity and inclusion initiatives, renewable energy research, and more. 
> 
> 2. **Greater emphasis on civic participation:** In recognition of polarizing political developments, some companies have made grants to promote civic participation and democratic norms. This includes funding for nonpartisan initiatives aimed at increasing voter turnout, education on democratic processes, and combating disinformation.
> 
> 3. **Shifts in lobbying efforts:** Traditionally, corporations have used a portion of their budgets to lobby for industry-friendly policies. Under the Trump administration, some companies reportedly redirected their lobbying efforts towards issues such as immigration reform or climate change policies, depending on their strategic interests and public opinion. 
> 
> Remember, the actual changes could vary significantly based on the specific corporation, its strategic interests, and the political climate. For updated information, I'd recommend looking at recent news articles or the corporations' own reporting on their giving strategies.

> As of my last training data in September 2021, several foundations have shown a strong commitment to climate action regardless of changes in government administration. These foundations prioritize climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts as part of their core mission and continue their work irrespective of the political landscape. Some foundations known for their sustained commitment to climate action include:
> 
> 1. **The ClimateWorks Foundation:** ClimateWorks is a global organization dedicated to advancing climate solutions and increasing philanthropic impact. They work with a network of partners to support policies and programs that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change.
> 
> 2. **The Hewlett Foundation:** The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has a strong focus on climate change and sustainability. They support research, policy advocacy, and grassroots initiatives aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon economy and addressing the impacts of climate change.
> 
> 3. **The David and Lucile Packard Foundation:** This foundation supports a range of environmental conservation efforts, including climate change mitigation. They fund projects aimed at promoting sustainable practices, protecting biodiversity, and reducing carbon emissions.
> 
> 4. **The Schmidt Family Foundation:** Founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy Schmidt, this foundation focuses on climate change, renewable energy, and sustainable development. They support innovation and advocacy in areas such as clean energy technologies and climate resilience.
> 
> 5. **The MacArthur Foundation:** The MacArthur Foundation supports initiatives related to climate change resilience and mitigation, particularly through their Climate Solutions program. They fund projects that aim to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy and build resilience in vulnerable communities.
> 
> These foundations and others are likely to continue their commitment to climate action under new administrations, recognizing the urgency and importance of addressing climate change regardless of political shifts. For the most up-to-date information on foundation commitments in light of specific administrations, I recommend checking their websites, press releases, and recent announcements.
