> I am filling out a section of the "Statement of Project Objectives" (SOPO) document required for a grant proposal to DOE. The project is "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)". My additions relate to the community benefits plan (CBP). Here is the concept note for the CBP:
> 
> ---
> The EMPOWER Community Benefits Plan focuses effort on two primary audiences: the offshore wind workforce and the coastal stakeholder communities. EMPOWER will engage these audiences by (1) integrating diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and accessibility; (2) contributing to energy equity and environmental justice; and (3) investing in America’s workforce.  
> 
> # Welcoming and Inclusive Environment 
> 
> EMPOWER will develop and implement equitable opportunities with clear decision-making procedures and a code of conduct. Our primary goal is to create a safe and supportive environment that fosters equitable opportunities for every team member in project activities. With a strong emphasis on open communication, we are committed to promoting the exchange of diverse perspectives and ideas. Scholarship and Mentorship: EMPOWER will develop and implement fellowship, scholarship and mentorship programs to promote equity in access and opportunities in offshore wind. The programs will leverage existing partnerships and activities among our partners, build new ones where there are gaps and will engage underserved communities to provide training and educational opportunities in offshore wind research and workforce training. We will direct our recruitment efforts to venues such as the SACNAS conference and engage community college networks, HBCUs, and Tribal Colleges, along with Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Industries (WRISE). Public Information Session and Community Advisory Board: The Consortium will engage and collaborate with coastal communities who are stakeholders in or directly affected by offshore wind projects by establishing relationships to address community concerns. Centered on the principle of co-creation and co-design, it will ensure community perspectives and priorities are integrated into EMPOWER decision-making by conducting public information sessions and forming a diverse community advisory board. Local residents, businesses, environmental organizations, and Tribal Nations will be engaged regularly to identify and prioritize community benefits that can be derived from the activities of the consortium. The community advisory board will meet at least two times a year to provide input, feedback, and recommendations and board members will be paid an honorarium consistent with best practices.   
> 
> The Mid-Atlantic region has a resident workforce with many of the skills needed to attract offshore wind manufacturers and developers. However, the scale and offshore location of the technology will require some workers to have industry-specific training. EMPOWER can help address this challenge by coordinating directly with the local workforce via the municipal economic development agencies and each state's higher education, technical and community colleges, workforce experts, industry experts, and other state agencies to expand activities such as vocational and union training, training facilities, certification programs, experiential learning opportunities, and curriculum development.
> 
> # Energy Equity 
> 
> EMPOWER will endeavor to address the disproportionate burdens that may be imposed on environmental justice (EJ) communities from offshore wind energy decisions and policies. We will take actions to address energy injustice and advance the just and fair siting, development, and governance of offshore wind energy systems. Equitable access to offshore wind benefits: EMPOWER will establish partnerships with local businesses and organizations to maximize procurement opportunities and subcontracting for minority-owned, women-owned, and disadvantaged enterprises, consistent with the philosophy of Justice40. The workforce training program will prioritize individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds or communities. Environmental justice and mitigation: EMPOWER will conduct environmental impact studies to identify any environmental justice concerns that our projects or those of our collaborating partners may create and develop mitigation plans accordingly. EMPOWER will draw together the expertise needed to effectively address environmental justice concerns in OSW energy siting, development, and governance. Building on our Public Information Sessions, we will initiate a public comment process, synthesizing an ongoing stream of comments to inform our stakeholders and our work. Educational outreach: We will empower individuals and communities to participate in offshore wind energy by increasing awareness, understanding, and participation of minority communities. Educational materials, workshops, and online resources will be developed to explain the benefits and impacts of offshore wind energy in accessible and culturally sensitive styles. Community fairs, renewable energy tours, and information sessions will be organized in collaboration with public schools, colleges, and community organizations to integrate offshore wind topics into educational curricula and career programs.

> # Invest in America’s Workforce 
> 
> Investing in America’s workforce is crucial for economic growth, competitiveness, and energy independence. By training American workers with offshore wind energy skills, the United States will be positioned as a global leader in offshore wind energy. EMPOWER will work to maximize the economic benefits of offshore wind energy by cultivating America’s existing and future workforce. In 2022, the Responsible Offshore Wind Alliance (RODA) prepared a research action plan that outlined the OSW concerns of the fishing industry. As it pertains to the existing American workforce, RODA identified that offshore wind energy might be seen as a benefit to fishermen as they diversify their work by assisting with offshore wind projects, however there might also be a loss or displacement of employment as experienced crew and their respective support services shift to offshore wind energy operations. EMPOWER will engage these communities to identify opportunities to sustain this important coastal workforce as offshore wind develops in the U.S. American Supply Chain: EMPOWER will play a supportive role through research and workforce training to encourage the localization of the supply chain and thus promote the growth of American businesses and reduce reliance on imports from abroad. In the offshore wind events that the consortium will organize, partnerships between offshore wind developers and the American supply chain will be facilitated to enhance the participation of American small and medium-sized companies in the supply chain. Skilled American Workforce: The workforce development and training programs will focus on upskilling/reskilling American workers for the specific needs of the offshore wind industry. During our 6-month design phase, we will use skill mappings and economic modeling to identify jobs lost and gained across the Mid-Atlantic, considering both the justice implications of these changes and re-skilling needs that allow us to inform the AWE programs. During the implementation period, we will integrate the comprehensive K12 educational programing at partner institutions like the Blue Heron Bowl and Kid Wind hosted by ECU CSI since 2015 and 2013 respectively, that focus on engaging students from underserved regional communities. The New Jersey Offshore Wind Bootcamp Training program at NJIT can effectively and efficiently provide initial training for engineers to make transition from traditional power trades to the offshore wind industry while the OSW Skills Academy and the Wind Power Graduate Certificate at UD can help train the professional workforce. American Research and Development: EMPOWER will partner with strong existing partnerships with the U.S. National Laboratories that already include joint faculty appointments and American companies to leverage American expertise and resources to nurture talents that can accelerate the development and deployment of cutting-edge offshore wind solutions for America. The knowledge developed by EMPOWER will be shared with the American OSW industry to enhance technical capabilities and elevate America’s leadership in offshore wind. EMPOWER will devise metrics to measure and track its performance, and at least once a year, reflect on and assess weaknesses, progress, and opportunities.
