> ### **The Impact of Heat Waves on Vulnerable Populations**
> As global temperatures rise, heat waves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing significant risks to vulnerable populations. The recent report highlighting how poorer households struggle with the costs of air conditioning during heat waves brings this issue into sharp relief [1496]. Additionally, the study on the increased number of abnormal warmth days due to climate change amplifies the immediacy of this threat [900].
> 
> Vulnerable communities often lack the resources to adapt effectively, which can lead to dire health consequences, including heatstroke and exacerbation of chronic conditions. Policymakers and energy providers must collaborate to ensure affordable and sustainable cooling solutions are accessible to all, mitigating the human cost of our warming planet.
