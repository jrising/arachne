> 
> The Nature article by Dritjon Gruda emphasizes the benefits academics can experience by prioritizing family life. Gruda reflects on how committing to family not only fosters respect among peers but can also lead to enhanced performance in research settings. The recognition of such balance paves the way for a discussion on how academia can better support family-friendly policies and environments [1911].

> ### **Sustainable Development Economics**
> 
> A 2024 publication in "ELMİ ƏSƏRLƏR" delves into the complex dynamics between rapid industrialization, resource exploitation, and environmental degradation. It underscores the necessity for a holistic approach to sustainable development, advocating for policies that treat economic growth and environmental conservation as compatible, rather than competing, objectives. This paper could serve as a critical reference for ongoing projects aimed at harmonizing growth with sustainability [2550].
