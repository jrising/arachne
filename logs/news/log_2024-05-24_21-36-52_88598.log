> Some caveats:
> 
>   * Again, we attribute all the change in PM2.5 in 2020 (relative to 5-yr avg) as due to wildfire. While this is probably not fully correct, the big spikes were definitely from wildfires. Further analysis will help clarify this. 
>   * PM2.5 from wildfire smoke might not have the same effect as overall PM2.5 (only some of which comes from wildfire). The science isn't clear on this yet. 
>   * We are in the midst of the COVID pandemic, and this has as-yet-unknown implications for our understanding of how air pollution affects health outcomes. Early evidence seems to suggest that poor air quality could worsen COVID-related outcomes, and if that's the case then our numbers above could be lower bounds. 
>   * Numbers above only look at elderly mortality and ER visits, and it's likely that other groups are very substantially affected (e.g. the very young, those with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions). Again, above numbers likely a dramatic lower bound on overall health consequences for that reason. 
>   * We don't know a ton about health responses at super high exposures. Does it tail off? Does it get way worse? You can find papers telling you both. Right now we're assuming response is linear, which is consistent with a lot of the literature. 
>   * We also don't have a full picture of "displacement" - i.e. if someone passes away due to air pollution exposure, maybe they were already extremely sick and so would have passed away in the near term anyway. Deryugina et al explore this to some degree by looking at 3-day (and longer) responses to a single day of pollution increase. They find effects of 1-day exposure over the next month to be about twice as big as the 3-day estimates we use, so again this could suggest our numbers are a lower bound. 
>   * Effects could also amplify over time, as its probably the case that exposure to 7 days in a row of terrible air is worse that exposure to 7 days spread out. Our numbers do not consider this, nor do we know of good estimates in the literature that would help with this. Please point them out if so!

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today's memo focuses on recent groundbreaking research in sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure. This research not only highlights the impacts of climate change but also proposes innovative solutions for mitigating these effects. Given your interests in global sustainability and resilient urban planning, these studies present significant advancements worth noting.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Climate Impacts Research Reaching Policy Makers**: A report titled *Climate impacts research is getting real* presents various instances where climate impact research has influenced real-world policies. For example, the US Government Accountability Office has relied on climate-economic research to advise federal efforts towards reducing economic exposure to climate risks [3].
> - **Phoenix Heat-Related Deaths Surge**: An alarming increase in heat-related deaths in Phoenix, attributed to soaring temperatures and inadequate urban planning, highlights the urgent need for climate-resilient infrastructure development [6].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Building Resilience**: Strategic design principles integrating components that can prevent partial building collapses from escalating into full-scale destruction offer promising solutions for enhancing urban infrastructure resilience [15]. This approach can be instrumental in developing climate-resilient cities.
> - **Wildfire Health Impacts**: Research on the health impacts of wildfire-induced air pollution revealed significant indirect mortality and morbidity rates, illustrating the extensive public health costs associated with worsening wildfires due to climate change [16].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **New Data on COVID-19 Policies**: The release of a new comprehensive public database tracking non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 can enhance future policy-making by providing insights into the effectiveness of various measures [14].
> - **Hurricane Preparedness**: As hurricane season approaches, it's critical to monitor the economic and infrastructural impacts of recent hurricanes. Data suggests long-term economic setbacks, such as the 21% GDP per capita drop forecasted for Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria [3].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Advancements in Climate-Resilient Urban Infrastructure**
> Climate change poses a critical challenge to urban infrastructure, necessitating innovative solutions to create resilient cities. Two significant studies offer new approaches to enhancing urban infrastructure resilience:
> 
> 1. **Strategic Links in Building Design**: The research revealed a novel design principle incorporating fail-safe components in buildings. These components can isolate parts of a structure as they fail, preventing a domino effect of collapses. This approach, detailed in a Nature article, promises to mitigate risks of partial collapses evolving into total destruction, a key consideration for cities vulnerable to extreme weather events [15].
> 
> 2. **Health Impact of Wildfire Smoke**: A detailed analysis of the indirect health impacts of wildfires on the US West Coast underscores the critical need for integrated urban planning that addresses both immediate and long-term health consequences. The study, which attributes thousands of excess deaths and ER visits to wildfire smoke exposure, calls for comprehensive wildfire management and urban planning strategies [16]. This research highlights the interconnected nature of environmental health, infrastructural resilience, and climate change, emphasizing the importance of integrated policy responses.
> 
> By focusing on resilient building designs and understanding the far-reaching impacts of environmental pollutants like wildfire smoke, we can better prepare urban environments for the challenges posed by climate change. These insights not only align with your commitment to global sustainability but also provide practical frameworks for advancing your interdisciplinary research and policy interests.
