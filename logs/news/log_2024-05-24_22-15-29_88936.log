> Title: Under God, indivisible? Religious salience and interstate territorial conflict
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How and under what conditions do religious factors explain the militarization
> of interstate territorial disputes? We argue that inconclusive findings in
> previous studies stem from inadequate consideration of the interaction between
> challenger state religiosity and the domestic constituencies actually invested
> in religiously salient territorial claims. To address this gap, this article
> differentiates between secular regimes, which provide minimal support to their
> state’s dominant religion and religious regimes, which strongly support their
> dominant religion. It also considers narrowly salient coreligionist
> populations, which appeal almost exclusively to religious audiences, versus
> broadly salient contested sacred sites, which appeal to much broader
> constituencies. We argue that the interaction between these two factors
> produces very different patterns of interstate conflict behavior. Secular
> regimes avoid escalation over narrowly salient religious claims because they
> do not depend upon religious constituents for support. However, they lack the
> necessary religious legitimacy to manage outbidding challenges that frequently
> arise over more broadly salient claims. Religious regimes, by contrast, enjoy
> high domestic religious legitimacy, enabling more peaceful engagement with
> broadly salient religious claims. Yet their political dependence upon
> religious constituencies incentivizes conflict when disputes involve narrowly
> salient religious claims. We test these propositions utilizing original data
> on the religious salience of interstate territorial disputes in the post-Cold
> War era, from 1990 to 2010. Analyses, using both dichotomous and continuous
> measures of regime religiosity, confirm these inferences and contribute to
> highly nuanced understandings of how state-religion policy and religious
> salience interact to influence patterns of interstate violence.

> Title: The Rebel Foreign Fighter Dataset
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article introduces the Rebel Foreign Fighter Dataset (RFFD) which can be
> used to expand research on civil war and foreign fighters (FFs). First, it
> largely expands the previously reported data on the number of FFs that have
> and continue to be involved in conflicts across the globe. Second, this
> database disaggregates FFs into the various rebel groups they inhabit as
> opposed to simply categorizing them as residing within a rebel movement.
> Third, low, high and best estimates of FFs within rebel groups have been
> provided as well as providing a novel FF ordinal coding mechanism. These
> additions allow for more accurate conclusions to be drawn on the effects of
> FFs on specific groups as well as on the conflict in which they reside. Using
> the RFFD, the link between FF inclusion and civilian sexual violence discussed
> in Doctor’s study will be re-examined. The new findings show that FF numbers
> below 1,000 do not have a significant impact on moderate levels of civilian
> victimization perpetrated by a rebel group and FF numbers below 100 do not

> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> The Democratic Republic of Congo hosts the longest-running and largest United
> Nations peacekeeping mission in history. The United Nations also has reckoned
> with sexual exploitation and abuse in its own ranks and, in 2003, recognized
> its importance with a Bulletin which became known as the ‘zero tolerance

> interact with peacekeeping personnel and interviews with 58 women who are
> raising children fathered by peacekeepers. Despite the United Nations policies
> in place, most women did not report children fathered by peacekeepers and did
> not receive systematic support. The analysis reveals a large gap between the

> Some caveats:
> 
>   * Again, we attribute all the change in PM2.5 in 2020 (relative to 5-yr avg) as due to wildfire. While this is probably not fully correct, the big spikes were definitely from wildfires. Further analysis will help clarify this. 
>   * PM2.5 from wildfire smoke might not have the same effect as overall PM2.5 (only some of which comes from wildfire). The science isn't clear on this yet. 
>   * We are in the midst of the COVID pandemic, and this has as-yet-unknown implications for our understanding of how air pollution affects health outcomes. Early evidence seems to suggest that poor air quality could worsen COVID-related outcomes, and if that's the case then our numbers above could be lower bounds. 
>   * Numbers above only look at elderly mortality and ER visits, and it's likely that other groups are very substantially affected (e.g. the very young, those with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions). Again, above numbers likely a dramatic lower bound on overall health consequences for that reason. 
>   * We don't know a ton about health responses at super high exposures. Does it tail off? Does it get way worse? You can find papers telling you both. Right now we're assuming response is linear, which is consistent with a lot of the literature. 
>   * We also don't have a full picture of "displacement" - i.e. if someone passes away due to air pollution exposure, maybe they were already extremely sick and so would have passed away in the near term anyway. Deryugina et al explore this to some degree by looking at 3-day (and longer) responses to a single day of pollution increase. They find effects of 1-day exposure over the next month to be about twice as big as the 3-day estimates we use, so again this could suggest our numbers are a lower bound. 
>   * Effects could also amplify over time, as its probably the case that exposure to 7 days in a row of terrible air is worse that exposure to 7 days spread out. Our numbers do not consider this, nor do we know of good estimates in the literature that would help with this. Please point them out if so!
