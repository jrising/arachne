> Understanding the progression and diagnosis of cancer is crucial for developing effective treatments. Recent studies demonstrate large-scale multi-omics analyses of cancer cell evolution at a single-cell resolution, unlocking potential avenues for early diagnosis and treatment [45710][20208]. Furthermore, the study of structural dynamics of DNA unwinding by helicases offers additional insights into the replication mechanisms, which could lead to breakthroughs in cancer therapy [39510]. These advanced methodologies might revolutionize the approach towards the detection and management of cancer in the coming years.
