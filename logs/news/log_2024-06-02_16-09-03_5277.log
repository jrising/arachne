> Title: Does the military lose public confidence without compliance with civilian control? Experimental evidence from Japan
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> The military’s compliance with civilian control – a requisite of democracy –
> is believed to be a key determinant of public confidence in the military.
> However, this claim is empirically inconclusive, and its analytical framework
> is underdeveloped at an institutional and individual level. Furthermore, most
> extant studies focus on the USA, and its validity in other environments is
> unknown. Hence, this study examined the causal relationship via an online
> survey experiment using hypothetical scenarios in Japan, an established
> democracy with a considerable armed force and civil–military norms imported
> from the USA decades ago. The results showed that the Japanese participants
> significantly lost their trust in the military for incompliance with civilian
> control amid an armed conflict. However, the magnitude of the impact was
> context-dependent; it substantially differed per the directions of
> incompliance (arbitrary action or inaction), the actors involved in the
> control (the prime minister and legislature), and the respondents’ attributes
> (partisanship). These findings reduce empirical inconclusiveness regarding the
> mechanism of public confidence in the military and could help to detect
> ominous signs regarding public attitudes toward democratic principles in
> modern society. Moreover, this study provides clues to understanding what
> people in Japan think about the aspect of control of their de facto military
> and how they evaluate this organization. These findings have significant
> implications for understanding international security dynamics, particularly
> at a time when Japan is launching its largest arms build-up since World War II
> to make its defense budget the third-largest worldwide, after the USA and
> China.

> Title: Civil war mediation in the shadow of IGOs: The path to comprehensive peace agreements
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Recent research shows that comprehensive peace agreements (CPAs) are effective
> in ending civil wars and improving post-conflict conditions, but CPAs emerge
> in only a fraction of civil wars. This study provides systematic evidence
> about the origins of CPAs and the role of international actors in facilitating
> their signing. We argue that mediation is more likely to be successful and
> that CPAs are more likely to emerge in those civil war countries that are
> members in a higher number of IGOs with high economic leverage. Using their
> financial and institutional leverage, these IGOs can help the combatants
> overcome the credible commitment problems associated with entering into
> mediation, and with making sufficient concessions and compromises to reach and
> sign a CPA. Analyzing all intrastate armed conflicts from 1989 to 2011, we
> find that a conflict country’s memberships in IGOs with high economic leverage
> increase the odds of (1) mediation occurring and (2) mediation subsequently
> leading to the signing of CPAs. This finding is robust to common sources of
> spurious relationships between international institutions and the behavior of
> conflict parties. Participating in IGOs with high economic leverage carries
> important positive consequences for civil war management and enhances the
> impact of mediation on getting conflict parties to sign CPAs.

> Title: Do UN peace operations help forcibly displaced people?
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Do UN missions reduce forced displacement? Facing insecure environments,

> expect to affect population movements, namely the size of their contingents
> and their mandated tasks. Using matched samples, we find that the unfolding of
> the outflows and inflows processes are affected by different features of UN
> missions. Sizeable deployments decrease IDPs flows and encourage their return;
> refugee outflows, on the other hand, may increase in presence of UN missions.
> Furthermore, missions with displacement-related mandates are associated with

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today’s insights span a mix of cutting-edge scientific research and pressing educational issues that reflect ongoing societal and environmental challenges. Highlights include significant advancements in radiopharmaceuticals, critical examinations of climate impacts on marine life, and concerning events in education that demand attention. These stories not only expand our understanding of scientific and social dynamics but also hint at the broader implications for global sustainability and societal enlightenment.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Covalent Targeted Radioligands in Radionuclide Therapy:** Researchers have developed radiopharmaceuticals using click chemistry to target tumor-specific proteins effectively, significantly improving the pharmacokinetics of radionuclide therapy and enhancing tumor regression [196].
> - **Mock Slave Auction Incident in Massachusetts:** A teacher has been placed on leave following a mock slave auction held in class and the use of a racial slur. This incident raises questions about educational environments and the handling of sensitive historical content [1305].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Climate Change and Marine Life:** Different studies underscore how climate phenomena like El Niño and the Southern Annular Mode are influencing marine ecosystems, particularly affecting reproductive development in Antarctic krill and carbon export efficiency in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. These insights are crucial as they highlight the complex interplay between climate change and marine biodiversity [1191][1015].
> - **Educational and Ethical Challenges:** The suspension of a teacher in Massachusetts after conducting a mock slave auction in the classroom underlines the urgent need for reassessing educational practices and curricula to avoid such grave missteps [1305].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **UN Peace Operations and Displacement:** The first global analysis of UN missions' impact on forced displacement suggests that sizable deployments can decrease internal displacement flows and encourage return, although refugee outflows may increase in the presence of UN missions [133].
> - **Psychiatric Restraint Concerns:** A harrowing account of a patient at the American Psychiatric Association’s annual meeting highlights ongoing issues with patient restraint and forced medication in psychiatric settings, suggesting systemic problems that require urgent ethical and procedural reforms [568].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Advancements in Cancer Therapy**
> Significant progress in cancer treatment was reported with the development of covalent targeted radioligands. These radiopharmaceuticals utilize click chemistry to attach to tumor-specific proteins, allowing for precise targeting of tumor cells. This innovation boosts the pharmacokinetics of radionuclide therapy, resulting in better tumor regression outcomes. These findings could revolutionize cancer treatment by offering more effective and targeted therapy options with potentially fewer side effects [196].
> 
> ### **Impact of Climate Change on Marine Ecosystems**
> Multiple studies highlight the profound effects of climate phenomena on marine life and ecosystems:
> - **Reproductive Development in Antarctic Krill:** The timing of reproductive development in female Antarctic krill is heavily influenced by seasonal climatic conditions, including the Southern Annular Mode and the Multivariate El Niño Index. This insight sheds light on the intricate dependency of marine life on climatic patterns and the potential cascading effects on the marine food web [1191].
> - **Carbon Export Efficiency in the Northern Gulf of Mexico:** Research on interannual variations of carbon export efficiency indicates that climate change significantly influences this parameter across seasons. The findings suggest that events like El Niño and La Niña have complex interactions with marine biogeochemical cycles, emphasizing the importance of understanding these dynamics for marine conservation efforts [1015].
> 
> These deep dives into the latest research elucidate the critical nature of addressing climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, presenting both challenges and opportunities for environmental sustainability.
