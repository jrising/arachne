> every day that someone asks you summarize a decade of research progress from
> your field in 800 words, so it seems worth documenting it somewhere.

> > data to quantify how changes in the climate cause changes in the economy.

> > trends continue unabated.
> 
> > **First, climate change is likely to have substantial negative impact on the
> > US economy.** Expected damages are on the scale of several trillions of
> > dollars, although there remains uncertainty in these numbers. For example,
> > in a detailed analysis of county-level productivity, a colleague at
> > University of Illinois and I estimated that the direct thermal effects alone
> > would likely reduce incomes nation-wide over the next 80 years, a loss
> > valued at roughly 5-10 trillion dollars in net present value. In another
> > analysis, a colleague from University of Chicago and I computed that losses
> > from intensified hurricanes were valued at around 900 billion dollars.
> > Importantly, these numbers are not a complete accounting of impacts and
> > other notable studies report larger losses.
> 
> > **Second, extreme weather events are short-lived, but their economic impact
> > is long-lasting.** Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and fires destroy assets
> > that took communities years to build. Rebuilding then diverts resources away
> > from new productive investments that would have otherwise supported future
> > growth. For example, a colleague at Rhodium Group and I estimated that
> > Hurricane Maria set Puerto Rico back over two decades of progress; and
> > research from MIT indicates that communities in the Great Plains have still
> > not fully recovered from the Dustbowl of the 1930s. As climate change makes
> > extreme events more intense and frequent, we will spend more attention and
> > more money replacing depreciated assets and repairing communities.
> 
> > **Third, the nature and magnitude of projected costs differs between
> > locations and industries** . For example, extreme heat will impose large
> > health, energy, and labor costs on the South; sea level rise and hurricanes
> > will damage the Gulf Coast; and declining crop yields will transform the
> > Plains and Midwest.
> 
> > **Fourth, because low income regions and individuals tend to be hurt more,
> > climate change will widen existing economic inequality.** For example, in a
> > national analysis of many sectors, the poorest counties suffered median
> > losses that were 9 times larger than the richest.
> 
> > **Fifth, many impacts of climate change will not be felt in the marketplace,
> > but rather in homes where health, happiness, and freedom from violence will
> > be affected.** There are many examples of this. Mortality due to extreme
> > heat is projected to rise dramatically. Increasingly humid summers are
> > projected to degrade happiness  and sleep quality. Research from Harvard
> > indicates that warming will likely elevate violent crime nationwide,
> > producing over 180,000 sexual assaults and over 22,000 murders across eight
> > decades. Colleagues at Stanford and I estimate that warming will generate
> > roughly 14,000 additional suicides in the next thirty years. Increasing
> > exposure of pregnant mothers to extreme heat and cyclones will harm fetuses
> > for their lifetime. These impacts do not easily convert to dollars and
> > cents, but they still merit attention.
> 
> > **Sixth, populations across the country will try to adapt to climate change
> > at substantial cost.** Some adaptions will transform jobs and lifestyles,
> > some will require constructing new defensive infrastructure, and some will
> > involve abandoning communities and industries where opportunities have
> > deteriorated. In all cases, these adaptations will come at real cost, since
> > resources expended on coping cannot be invested elsewhere.
> 
> > **Lastly, outside of the US, the global consequences of climate change are
> > projected to be large and destabilizing.** Unmitigated warming will likely
> > slow global growth roughly 0.3 percentage points and reduce political
> > stability throughout the tropics and subtropics.
> 
> > Together, these findings indicate that our climate is one of the nation’s
> > most important economic assets. We should manage it with the seriousness and
> > clarity of thought that we would apply to managing any other asset that also
> > generates trillions of dollars in value for the American people.

> Title: Structural adjustment, partisan alignment, and protest in the developing world
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> When do IMF programs induce protest? Despite much cross-country research on
> this question, there is little evidence on how IMF programs affect individual
> predispositions for protest and protest behavior. This article argues that
> governments facing IMF conditionality allocate adjustment burdens
> strategically, protecting their partisan supporters while punishing supporters
> of the political opposition. This intensification of distributional politics
> under IMF programs will increase protests by opposition supporters. To test
> this argument, we utilize a mixed-method strategy combining individual-level
> survey evidence from 12 sub-Saharan African countries and an intertemporal
> case study of Kenya. The results find strong evidence for our argument.
> Opposition supporters are significantly more likely to protest when a
> government goes under an IMF program, especially when the program entails
> public-sector conditions. Our analysis suggests that governments are not
> innocent bystanders in the adjustment process. Instead, they co-determine
> inclinations for protest by deciding over the allocation of adjustment burdens
> to the detriment of opposition groups and the benefit of their supporters.
> These results have important implications for the role of governments as
> purveyors of pressures for global policy reform induced by international
> financial institutions.

> Title: An in-situ image enhancement method for the detection of marine organisms by remotely operated vehicles
> Description: Abstract
> 
> With the assistance of the visual system, remote operated vehicles (ROVs) can
> replace frogmen to achieve safer and more efficient capturing of marine
> organisms. However, the selective absorption and scattering of light lead to a
> decrease in the visual quality of underwater images, which hinders ROV
> operators from observing the operating environment. Unfortunately, most image
> enhancement methods only focus on image color correction rather than
> perceptual enhancement, which in turn prevents the object detector from
> quickly locating the target. Therefore, a visual-enhanced and detection-
> friendly underwater image enhancement method is needed. In this paper, an
> underwater image enhancement method called  in-situ  enhancement is proposed
> to improve the semantic information of the visual hierarchy based on current
> scene information in multiple stages. Mapping the underwater image to its dual
> space allows the enhancement equation to be applied to severely degraded
> underwater scenes. Moreover, it is also a detection-friendly method and has
> good generalization in both visual quality improvement and object detection.
> The experimental results show that in different underwater datasets, the  in-
> situ  enhancement effectively improves the visual quality of underwater
> images, and its enhanced results train different object detectors with high
> detection accuracy.

> Title: Revisiting the puzzle of endogenous nuclear proliferation
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Nuclear proliferation literature typically differentiates supply-side and
> demand-side factors influencing the spread of nuclear weapons. These distinct
> approaches to the proliferation puzzle raise the following empirical
> questions: Does nuclear supply stimulate states’ demand for nuclear weapons?
> Conversely, does the demand for nuclear weapons really facilitate the
> acquisition of nuclear supply? If such endogeneity exists between the demand-
> side and supply-side determinants, how would it cause empirical bias in the
> estimation of their effects on nuclear proliferation? This article aims to
> unpack endogenous mechanisms of nuclear demand and nuclear supply over the
> course of nuclear proliferation. In particular, it examines two potential
> sources of endogeneity: (1) simultaneous interactions between states’ nuclear
> development decisions and nuclear technological capability and (2) selection
> bias in nuclear development. To address each source of endogeneity,
> simultaneous equation models and the duration models with selection are
> estimated, respectively. Contrary to what recent supply-side literature
> suggests, the empirical analyses reveal that states’ nuclear demand is
> primarily driven by external security threats instead of their existing
> nuclear technology, and that their successful acquisition of nuclear
> technology mainly follows as the result of nuclear development efforts but
> does not necessarily depend on individual supply-side factors. This article
> addresses the typical inference issues in nuclear proliferation research and
> contributes to our synthetic understanding of proliferation mechanisms.

> Title: Episodes of regime transformation
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article provides a new conceptualization of regime transformation that
> allows scholars to address democratization and autocratization as related but
> obverse processes. We introduce a dataset that captures 680 episodes of regime
> transformation (ERT) from 1900 to 2019 and offers novel insights into regime
> change over the past 120 years. The ERT has three main advantages over other
> approaches. First, it avoids problematic assumptions of unit homogeneity and
> constant as well as symmetric effects. Second, it integrates key insights from
> qualitative studies by treating regime change as a gradual and uncertain
> process. Third, the ERT is based on a unified framework for studying regime
> transformation in either direction. The dataset differentiates between four
> broad types of regime transformation: liberalization in autocracies,
> democratic deepening in democracies, and autocratization in both democracies
> and autocracies (democratic and autocratic regression). It further
> distinguishes ten patterns with distinct outcomes, including standard
> depictions of regime change (i.e. democratic transition or breakdown). A
> minority (32%) of ERTs produce a regime transition, with the majority of
> episodes either ending before a transition takes place or not having the
> potential for such a transition (i.e. further democratization in democratic
> regimes or further autocratization in autocratic regimes). We also provide
> comparisons to other datasets, illustrative case studies to demonstrate face
> validity, and a discussion about how the ERT framework can be applied in peace
> research.

> Title: Gendering hawkishness in the war room: Evidence from Pakistani politicians
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Can representation in foreign policy deliberations – in particular, increased
> female representation – impact deliberators’ support for interstate conflict
> resolution? While existing work on gender representation in IR suggests that
> increased female representation should moderate intragroup hawkishness, making
> conflict resolution more viable, I offer empirical evidence that qualifies
> this idea, based on a survey experiment on 149 male and 55 female elite
> Pakistani legislators. Politicians of both sexes were randomly assigned to
> ‘listen in’ on a hypothetical national security deliberation that was either
> all-male or gender-mixed. I find that politicians’ decisionmaking in these
> hypothetical committees was informed simultaneously by notions of committee
> competence and by inferences about the social desirability of hawkish outcomes
> in deliberative settings. Specifically, respondents assigned to gender-mixed
> committees became less supportive of external conflict resolution. I show how
> different mechanisms accounted for this increased hawkishness for men and
> women. Female politicians assigned to gender-mixed committees became more
> conscious and wary of how their participation, the result of increased
> representation, would be perceived, compelling them to opt for more hawkish
> policies. Male politicians, in contrast, attempted to overcompensate for the
> increased visibility of female representation by resorting to greater levels
