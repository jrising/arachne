> ### **Geoengineering: Can Seaweed Save the Planet?**
> The concept of using seaweed to mitigate climate change through ocean dumping is drawing significant skepticism. One prominent expert outright dismissed the idea, describing it as "nonsense" [11437]. The debate around this method surfaces fundamental questions about the viability and ethical considerations of large-scale geoengineering projects. Proponents argue that seaweed farming and subsequent dumping could sequester significant amounts of CO₂, leveraging natural oceanic processes for climate benefit. However, critics point to potential disruptions to marine ecosystems, untested environmental impacts, and the diversion of resources from more proven methods of emissions reduction.
