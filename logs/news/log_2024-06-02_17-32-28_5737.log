> Title: Election proximity and the effectiveness of economic sanctions
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Do elections matter for sanction effectiveness? Scholars have long highlighted
> the importance of domestic political factors in target (i.e. sanctioned)
> states in explaining when economic sanctions work. This line of research,
> however, has primarily focused on political regime characteristics and
> interest groups that are relatively low time-variant during sanction episodes.
> Building on this literature, we explore the effect of temporal proximity to
> elections. While the impact of elections have been examined in the context of
> military conflicts, their possible effects on sanction effectiveness have not
> been subject to systematic scrutiny. We argue that target governments are more
> likely to comply with sender demands as elections loom near in order to avoid
> the likely political costs of sanctions. The effect of elections, however, is
> likely to vary across different election characteristics and political regime
> types. We assess the empirical merits of our claims using data on over 1,000
> sanction cases between 1950 and 2020. The results from a battery of empirical
> tests, including those that account for potential selection bias, support our
> hypotheses. We find that elections have a positive effect on sanction success,
> and this effect is more prominent in less democratic states that hold
> competitive elections. This suggests that even if sanctions have a relatively
> low success rate against non-democratic polities, elections may provide a
> window of opportunity for senders to extract concessions from target states.

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> In a rapidly changing world, several key developments highlight the intricate interplay between environmental sustainability, technological advancements, and socio-political dynamics. As societies transition toward greener practices, the integration of environmental technologies, innovative financial policies, and sustainable resources continues to form the backbone of our shared future. These themes are not only central to global sustainability but are also critical in understanding complex systems and leveraging them for impactful change.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Carbon Offsets, a Much-Criticized Climate Tool, Get Federal Guidelines:**
>   The U.S. government has released new principles aimed at defining 'high-integrity' carbon offsets, addressing the growing concerns about their effectiveness in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions [859].
>   
> - **State of Families Brief Report: Maine (2023):**
>   A comprehensive overview of Maine families using the latest data from the US Census Bureau and other sources, highlighting demographic trends and socio-economic factors [1048].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Emerging Environmental Technologies and Policies:**
>   A study on how environmental technologies, green financial policies, and energy uncertainties impact sustainability offers valuable directives for policymakers. This is crucial as economic expansion and dependence on natural resource rents continue to pose challenges to environmental preservation [1153].
>   
> - **Local Food Systems and Indigenous Communities:**
>   Research on the importance of diversity in local food systems, specifically focusing on the indigenous food system on St. Paul Island, Alaska. Understanding these systems can help in maintaining food security amid various challenges [1008].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Sunspot Cluster and Auroral Displays:**
>   The return of a massive sunspot region that previously led to stunning auroral displays, indicating potential for more visual phenomena and effects on communication systems [758].
>   
> - **Legalized Cannabis and Senior Health:**
>   A significant increase in cannabis poisonings among people 65 and older post-legalization in Canada, highlighting the need for improved public health education and safety measures [569].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Toward Sustainable Ecology: Trends and Challenges**
> The shift towards sustainable ecology is influenced by multiple factors including environmental technologies and green financial policies. Research indicates that economic growth linked to natural resource exploitation contributes significantly to environmental degradation. Policymakers are now provided with strategic insights on promoting environmental sustainability while balancing economic pressures [1153].
> 
> ### **Food Security and Indigenous Practices**
> The importance of diversity in local food systems is exemplified by the indigenous food system on St. Paul Island, Alaska. This system's social interactions are key to maintaining food security despite numerous challenges. By analyzing these interactions, the study sheds light on how diversity aids resilience in food systems, which can inform broader food security strategies [1008].
> 
> In essence, today's developments underscore the need for cohesive strategies that intertwine technological advancements, policy-making, and community-based practices to navigate the complexities of global sustainability.
