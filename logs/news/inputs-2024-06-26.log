> ### **Climate Change Impact on Heat Waves**
> Heat waves are becoming a more frequent occurrence as the climate continues to warm. The current heat wave forecasted to impact the eastern half of the United States [77] serves as a stark reminder of the changing climate patterns. These heat events pose significant risks to public health, strain energy grids, and affect agricultural productivity. Adaptive measures like improved cooling infrastructure, public health advisories, and urban planning to enhance green cover and reduce heat islands are crucial. Furthermore, long-term mitigative strategies focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions remain paramount.
