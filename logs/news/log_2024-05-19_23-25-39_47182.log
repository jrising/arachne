> Title: Sending the B team: The impact of lesser signals of resolve
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> When signaling resolve, is it necessary to go ‘all-in’ and send the strongest
> possible signal or can sending a lesser signal be effective? Prior research
> suggests that sending a lesser signal is an admission of irresolution, akin to
> sending no signal. We make the novel claim that lesser signals of resolve can
> actually be worse for credibility than sending no signal, particularly in
> general deterrence situations. We theorize that while the absence of a signal
> may go unnoticed, a lesser signal puts a spotlight on irresolution. Building
> on prior findings that high-level visits can function as signals of extended
> deterrence commitment, we test our theory using new data on visits abroad by
> the US president, vice president, secretary of state, and secretary of
> defense. We find that only presidential visits are effective at deterring
> military challenges against the country visited. Visits by lesser officials,
> whom we dub the ‘B Team’, actually increase the risk of deterrence failure.

> Title: The motivating and mobilizing effects of inequality on civil conflict: Focusing on trade-induced labor market shocks
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article has two aims: (1) to identify the causal effect of income
> inequality on civil conflict and (2) to find the mechanism in which
> disadvantaged individuals can mobilize collective violence. Applying the
> Heckscher-Ohlin and Stopler-Samuelson theorems, this study hypothesizes that
> workers in land-rich countries – those who face contracted demand in the labor
> market and consequently a larger income disparity – will have a lower
> opportunity cost to engage in conflict as trade expands. Exploiting exogenous
> spatial variation in inequality due to the country’s factor endowment,
> together with time variation in tariffs arising from the economic
> liberalization, the work of this research documents a statistically
> significant and economically meaningful causal effect of inequality on civil
> conflict. Secondly, to identify the mobilizing effect of inequality, I test
> whether higher disparity in income distribution within an ethnic group breeds
> more rebellions initiated by the group. Esteban and Ray’s model claims that an
> increase in income inequality within an ethnic group makes collective violence
> more likely, because the poor within the group provide conflict labor, and the
> rich within the group provide resources for violence. By merging international
> census data that cover 115 million individuals from 221 ethnic groups with the
> groups’ conflict records, the analysis empirically identifies that when
> holding total ethnic income constant, within-group inequality that is proxied
> by the unemployment rate is strongly correlated with the group’s propensity to
> initiate armed conflicts. Shedding new light on the prevailing scholarly
> discord that exclusively chooses either one of class and ethnic cleavages as
> sources of intrastate violence, the findings of this study imply that if
> trade-induced labor market shocks increase within-group inequality, it
> motivates workers to participate in rebellions by lowering their opportunity
> cost of fighting and mobilizes ethnic collective violence by allowing the
> ethnic leaders to recruit combatants at a lower cost.

> Title: A spatiotemporal analysis of ungulate–vehicle collision hotspots in response to road construction and realignment
> Description: Although roads are central to human society, they have many negative
> environmental impacts and create risk for traveling motorists. Our aim was to
> evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of ungulate–vehicle collision (UVC)
> hotspots in response to major road construction. We examined two different
> locations and scales in the province of Alberta, Canada: (1) a highway bypass
> adjacent to a large city with 4.5 km of wildlife mitigation measures (wildlife
> fencing and two underpasses) and (2) 55 km of rural highway that was converted
> from a two-lane to a four-lane divided highway. Using government police
> collision and carcass data (2000–2021), before-after and control-impact
> analyses were used to assess changes in UVC rates. Our approach is novel in
> that we tested the paired use of a clustering method known as kernel density
> estimation plus and a spatiotemporal stepwise modification of this method to
> monitor UVC hotspots. By monitoring UVCs over space and time, we could
> identify stable vs. ephemeral UVC hotspots, a fence-end effect, and a barrier
> effect due to traffic volume, and we could explore hotspot stability before
> and after construction. The wildlife mitigation measures along the highway
> bypass resulted in 86% fewer UVCs compared to an unmitigated highway. At a
> larger scale, however, net benefits were affected by road density. The
> construction of a four-lane divided highway with no wildlife mitigation
> measures and an increase in the posted speed limit resulted in a slight
> increase in UVCs and the reemergence of the majority of historical UVC
> hotspots. Our analysis highlighted the need to incorporate wildlife
> considerations at a variety of scales throughout the transportation planning
> and mitigation evaluation process.

> Title: State violence and participation in transitional justice: Evidence from Colombia
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Can the legacy of state violence undermine participation in transitional
> justice services designed to consolidate peace after conflict? We argue that,
> in the aftermath of armed fighting, state-perpetrated violence leads to
> reduced uptake of government reconciliation policies. We leverage spatial and
> temporal variation in levels of civilian victimization by perpetrator and find
> that, in contrast to violence committed by non-state groups, violence carried
> out by state forces against civilians is associated with lower levels of
> enlistment in Colombia’s state-run victims’ registry. We replicate this
> relationship using survey data and present evidence linking victimization by
> the state to lower levels of trust in the government overall. Together, our
> analyses demonstrate that disaggregating the identity of armed actors can
> provide significant theoretical and empirical advances in our understanding of
> peacemaking and post-conflict reconstruction. In the Colombian case, the
> legacy of state violence leads to the systematic exclusion of certain types of
> victims from transitional justice and undermines trust in the institutions
> responsible for building durable pathways to peace. Consequently, our findings
> have implications for the design of transitional justice policies, the study
> of the legacies of conflict on political and social outcomes, and processes of
> post-conflict peacebuilding.

> Title: The Rebel Foreign Fighter Dataset
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article introduces the Rebel Foreign Fighter Dataset (RFFD) which can be
> used to expand research on civil war and foreign fighters (FFs). First, it
> largely expands the previously reported data on the number of FFs that have
> and continue to be involved in conflicts across the globe. Second, this
> database disaggregates FFs into the various rebel groups they inhabit as
> opposed to simply categorizing them as residing within a rebel movement.
> Third, low, high and best estimates of FFs within rebel groups have been
> provided as well as providing a novel FF ordinal coding mechanism. These
> additions allow for more accurate conclusions to be drawn on the effects of
> FFs on specific groups as well as on the conflict in which they reside. Using
> the RFFD, the link between FF inclusion and civilian sexual violence discussed
> in Doctor’s study will be re-examined. The new findings show that FF numbers
> below 1,000 do not have a significant impact on moderate levels of civilian
> victimization perpetrated by a rebel group and FF numbers below 100 do not
> have a significant impact on high levels of civilian victimization.

> Title: Controlling a moving world: Territorial control, displacement and the spread of civilian targeting in Iraq
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How do armed actors respond to population movements during civil wars? I argue
> that displacement alters local balances of control between territorial rulers
> and challengers. Local territorial rulers have incentives to govern violently
> if displaced persons perceived as members of opposing loyalty groups move into
> their territories and challengers spoil local governance by inflicting harm on
> civilians if incoming supporters of a local ruler reinforce the governor’s
> control. To test these dynamics, I use a combination of manual coding and
> machine learning to create a novel monthly dataset of territorial control,
> one-sided violence against moving populations and displacement patterns
> disaggregated by ethno-religious groups in the war against the Islamic State
> (2014–2017) in Iraq. Using negative binomial count models, I find that
> territorial challengers and rulers distinctively respond to population
> movements in Iraq. The paper extends previous theories of civilian
> victimization and territorial control by conceptualizing local populations as
> a dynamic element that explains where fleeing civilians become moving targets.

> Title: An update on the biological parameters of the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea
> Description: Abstract
> 
> The Norway lobster,  Nephrops norvegicus  , is one of the most valuable
> fishery resources in many coastal countries of the Mediterranean Sea and the
> northeastern Atlantic Ocean. In the Mediterranean Sea, several stocks are
> being overexploited, with ecological, economic, and social consequences. To
> perform an adequate stock assessment and provide guidance on maximum
> sustainable yield, reliable biological parameters of the species are required.
> Considering that biological parameters may change over time in overexploited
> populations, in the present study, we updated key biological parameters for
> the  N. norvegicus  stock of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea: size at which
> 50% (L50) of females were in reproductive condition, length–weight
> relationship, and individual size structure. Moreover, daily landings were
> combined with the spatial position of the vessels tracked by their Vessel
> Monitoring System (VMS), to obtain information on the geographical
> distribution and time series of Landings Per Unit Effort (LPUE), as well as
> total landings from 2008 to 2021. Our results suggest overexploitation of the
> resource, revealing a severe reduction in size at 50% maturity, an earlier
> spawning and brooding period, and a clear decrease of LPUE over time.

> Moreover, the majority of scientific articles reporting research conducted in
> Africa include foreign coauthors (6, 7), and African researchers rarely attain
> prestigious first or last authorship positions (8). Intra-African cooperation
