> The concept of zero-sum thinking, which suggests that one's gain is inherently another's loss, is increasingly permeating various aspects of our lives. This mindset is visible in geopolitical strategies, social dynamics, and even in popular culture, creating barriers to progress on global issues such as sustainable development and climate change. The challenge lies in transforming this perspective to a more collaborative framework that recognizes shared benefits and collective goals [37027].
