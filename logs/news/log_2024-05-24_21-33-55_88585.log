> Title: Episodes of regime transformation
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article provides a new conceptualization of regime transformation that
> allows scholars to address democratization and autocratization as related but
> obverse processes. We introduce a dataset that captures 680 episodes of regime
> transformation (ERT) from 1900 to 2019 and offers novel insights into regime
> change over the past 120 years. The ERT has three main advantages over other
> approaches. First, it avoids problematic assumptions of unit homogeneity and
> constant as well as symmetric effects. Second, it integrates key insights from
> qualitative studies by treating regime change as a gradual and uncertain
> process. Third, the ERT is based on a unified framework for studying regime
> transformation in either direction. The dataset differentiates between four
> broad types of regime transformation: liberalization in autocracies,
> democratic deepening in democracies, and autocratization in both democracies
> and autocracies (democratic and autocratic regression). It further
> distinguishes ten patterns with distinct outcomes, including standard
> depictions of regime change (i.e. democratic transition or breakdown). A
> minority (32%) of ERTs produce a regime transition, with the majority of
> episodes either ending before a transition takes place or not having the
> potential for such a transition (i.e. further democratization in democratic
> regimes or further autocratization in autocratic regimes). We also provide
> comparisons to other datasets, illustrative case studies to demonstrate face
> validity, and a discussion about how the ERT framework can be applied in peace
> research.

> Title: Asymmetric burden-sharing and the restraining and deterrence effects of alliances
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Alliances are often presumed to serve the dual purpose of restraint and
> deterrence, though few existing studies examine their relationship and the
> connection with defense burden-sharing. This research employs a three-player
> game-theoretic model, which endogenizes the process of alliance formation and
> arms buildups, to demonstrate how intra-alliance burden-sharing allows the
> alliance to preserve the status quo. The results suggest that alliance burden-
> sharing may exert the deterrence and restraining effects, while at most one
> effect is observable at a time because the effects occur in separate parameter
> spaces. If a prospective ally’s cost of arms buildups is relatively low, a
> status-quo-oriented superpower may form an alliance even by shouldering a
> disproportionately heavy burden to dissuade the ally from overturning the
> status quo (the restraining effect). Conversely, if the cost is relatively
> high, the superpower may form an alliance to protect the ally from external
> threats (the deterrence effect). However, to prevent being exploited by this
> ally, the superpower provides only the units of armed forces that are
> sufficient to incentivize the ally to bolster its military capabilities to
> deter the threats. Their alliance entails power aggrandizement, but it does
> not provoke a non-signatory as the ally remains too weak to act unilaterally.

> Title: Justice as fairness or retribution? Citizen reactions to domestic trials of wartime violence
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How do domestic trials addressing wartime violence affect public opinion of
> government? The legitimation functions of national courts are well studied in
> liberal democracies, but less is known about the effects of trials that
> address abuses committed during large-scale conflict. This article
> investigates how the extent to which such trials achieve procedural justice
> (fairness in process) and retributive justice (allocation of punishment)
> affects perceptions of political legitimacy. I provide survey-experimental
> evidence from post-conflict El Salvador that leverages the repeal of a
> longstanding amnesty law. Although a trial in general improves citizen
> evaluations of state competence, fairness and punishment serve crucial – and
> distinct – legitimation functions. Procedural fairness significantly increased
> citizens’ willingness to comply with state authorities, regardless of trial
> outcome. Yet, an unfair trial, when coupled with punishment, bolstered trust
> in politicians and the judiciary. This suggests a trade-off between public
> preferences for fairness and an ‘iron fist’ approach to violence. The findings
> reveal the limits of procedural justice in a post-conflict environment and
> furnish new insights on the multifaceted functions of human rights trials.

> Title: Violence against civilians and public support for the state: The moderating role of governance and ideology
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> When state armed forces engage in violence against civilians during civil
> wars, why do some citizens continue to support the government? I argue that
> individuals’ support for the state in such contexts is shaped by the interplay
> between their perceptions of violence, governance and ideology. Drawing on
> research concerning motivated reasoning, I suggest that ideological similarity
> with and effective governance from the state can alleviate the negative effect
> of military violence against civilians on support for the state and,
> conversely, augment the positive effect of insurgent abuse on attitudes toward
> the government. Analysis of seven years of surveys fielded by the Latin
> American Public Opinion Project in Colombia between 2005 and 2011 suggests
> that individuals’ responses to victimization by the state’s armed forces
> depend on whether the individuals are ideologically aligned with the state.
> More specifically, among people who have an ideology similar to that of the
> president, military victimization has a less negative effect on support for
> the armed forces and for the national government. There is also mixed evidence
> that the quality of state governance, particularly the provision of security
> from crime, shapes the ways people respond to victimization. While existing
> studies primarily focus on the effects of either violence or governance on
> attitudes toward the state, these findings indicate that a more complete
> theory of why people support governments which engage in violence against
> civilians requires an understanding of not only violence but also of
> governance and ideology.

> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today's memo explores the intricate dynamics of regime transformations and the impact of these changes on global peace, stability, and sustainability. Additionally, we examine the burgeoning relationship between new technological advancements and their applications in fisheries management and medical treatments.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Episodes of Regime Transformation:** A new conceptualization of regime transformation is introduced, capturing 680 episodes from 1900 to 2019. The dataset provides insights into how democratization and autocratization occur as related but inverse processes, identifying distinct patterns and outcomes [136].
> - **Behavioral Responses of Pacific Cod to Fishing Gear:** New research harnesses archival tag accelerometer data to shed light on how Pacific cod respond to bottom trawl vessels and gear, with significant implications for sustainable fisheries management [405].
> - **Targeted Radioligands for Tumor Therapy:** Science delivers promising news on radiopharmaceuticals using click chemistry to target tumor-specific proteins, enhancing the efficiency of radionuclide therapy [489].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Regime Change and Peace Research:** The implementation of the ERT dataset can provide novel insights for peace research by treating regime change as a gradual and uncertain process, thus avoiding oversimplified assumptions [136].
> - **Synergy in Agent-Based Modeling and Randomized Control Trials:** Advancing the collaboration between agent-based models and randomized trials could greatly enhance the scope and detail of applied research, potentially influencing policy decisions and experimental frameworks [538].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Impact of Preferential Sampling on Ecological Trends:** Upcoming research in ecological modelling highlights how preferential sampling can skew ecological status assessments, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions and misguided conservation efforts [65].
> - **FDA Alerts on COVID-19 Vaccine Responses:** The effect of Wuhan-1 mRNA vaccines on antibody formation could be crucial for understanding long-term immunity and vaccine design, especially in preparation for future pandemics [174].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Regime Transformation and Peace**
> The conceptualization and dataset provided in the recent Journal of Peace Research article offer a profound tool for understanding regime transformations over the past century [136]. This dataset not only records the transitions but also categorizes them into liberalization in autocracies, democratic deepening in democracies, and autocratization in both regimes. The implications for peace research are significant; by acknowledging the complexity and gradual nature of these shifts, scholars can better predict and respond to potential instability.
> 
> ### **Technological Innovations in Fisheries and Medicine**
> Recent advancements demonstrate the profound utility of technology in managing both natural resources and health. The study on Pacific cod [405] offers a glimpse into how detailed behavioral data can inform more sustainable fishing practices, potentially reducing bycatch and helping maintain fish populations. Concurrently, innovations in targeted radioligand therapy provide hope for more effective cancer treatments by leveraging precision medicine to directly attack tumor cells [489].
> 
> These studies underline the importance of integrating advanced technological methods with traditional research to address pressing global challenges, be it in environmental conservation or medical treatments.
> 
> ---
> 
> By focusing on these key issues, today's memo highlights the intersection of political science, technology, and sustainability, underscoring the multifaceted approach needed to tackle complex global issues.
