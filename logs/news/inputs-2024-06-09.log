> #### **Climate Change and Carbon Export in the Northern Gulf of Mexico**
> A new study has found that interannual variations in carbon export efficiency in the Northern Gulf of Mexico are dominated by climate change. The research specifically investigates how El Niño and La Niña events influence fluvial discharge and consequently affect carbon cycling in the region [1051]. This highlights the intricate connections between climate patterns and marine carbon processes, underscoring the critical need for climate mitigation strategies.

> #### **Premelting of Ice Ih**
> Advances in cryogenic atomic force microscopy have allowed researchers to image the surface structure of hexagonal water ice (Ice Ih) with atomic resolution. This breakthrough provides a molecular perspective on the premelting processes of ice Ih, enhancing our understanding of ice behavior under varying temperature conditions [211]. These findings could have significant implications for climate science, particularly in improving predictions of ice dynamics in polar regions.
