> ### **Io’s Tidal Mysteries**
> Io, one of Jupiter's moons, has fascinated scientists due to its intense volcanic activity. The recent study [26444] challenges the existing notion that Io hosts a shallow magma ocean, providing new insights into its geophysical processes. Understanding Io's internal structure could provide broader clues about volcanic mechanics and processes on other celestial bodies. This research exemplifies the intricate link between tidal forces and planetary geology, emphasizing how tidal heating affects planetary bodies within our solar system.
