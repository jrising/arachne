> ### **Sustainability Innovations in Packaging**
> 
> The quest for more sustainable packaging solutions is gaining momentum with two notable recent developments:
> 
> 1. **Self-Biodegradable Plastics:** Engineers have embedded a thermostable hydrolase enzyme into polylactic acid (PLA), making the resulting plastic both biodegradable and suitable for home composting. This innovation could significantly reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste, making it ideal for industrial packaging applications [4960].
> 
> 2. **Edible Coffee Packaging:** Researchers have successfully created an edible, water-soluble film using κ-carrageenan, carboxymethyl starch, and gum ghatti. This film dissolves rapidly in water and is intended for packaging instant coffee powder. Such packaging could eliminate the environmental footprint associated with traditional single-use coffee packaging materials [2851].
> 
> Together, these innovations showcase the growing emphasis on sustainability within the materials science community. They represent promising strides towards reducing plastic waste and advancing eco-friendly alternatives, crucial for achieving broader environmental goals.
