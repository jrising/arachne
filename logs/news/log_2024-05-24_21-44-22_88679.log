> Title: Introducing the Lynching in Latin America (LYLA) dataset
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article introduces the Lynching in Latin America (LYLA) dataset. Lynching
> is a surprisingly prevalent form of collective violence, but the systematic
> study of this phenomenon has previously been hampered by a lack of cross-
> national event data. The LYLA data covers reported lynching incidents across
> Latin America between 2010 and 2019. In total, it includes 2818 lynching
> events in 18 countries. The data features information on the alleged
> wrongdoing that motivated the event, the type of violence deployed, the size
> of the mob, the exact date of the event and geo-coded coordinates capturing
> where the event took place at the street level. The LYLA data provides an
> empirical basis to assess questions concerning the conditions that give rise
> to lynching, the impact of lynching on communities and social processes, and
> policies to prevent this form of violence. This article introduces the
> rationale for the data collection, the coding rules and procedures, and offers
> an illustrative example of how this data can be used, focusing on state
> illegitimacy as a key condition for lynching.

> Title: Response of the meso- and macro-zooplankton community to long-term environmental changes in the southern North Sea
> Description: Abstract
> 
> The North Sea (NS) is changing rapidly. Temporal variations in fishing
> intensity and eutrophic conditions, along with the ongoing impact of climate
> change, act in synergy resulting in modifications in marine communities.
> Although zooplankton has been extensively investigated, studies often ignore
> the large-sized meso- and macro-zooplankton (>500 µm), including holoplankton
> and meroplankton taxa. Here, we examined changes in abundances and community
> structure of these organisms between 1975 and 2018, using univariate and
> multivariate analysis, at different taxonomic levels. Abrupt changes in the
> abundances of (sub)communities occurred during different time periods and
> resulted in a significant restructuration of the entire community in 2006.
> These changes were consistent with the regime shifts reported in the NS and
> were a consequence of the environmental pressures on the whole community or on
> specific subcommunities. In the long term, the community shifted from higher
> abundances of hydrozoans and holoplankton taxa to an increasing abundance of
> decapods. Furthermore, we reveal the environmental variables that most explain
> the variability in the community dynamics, highlighting the importance of
> temperature and top-down processes. Our study underlines the relevance of
> investigations at different taxonomic levels, which elucidates how distinct
> responses to environmental changes ultimately shape the entire community
> structure.

> Title: State violence and target group adaptation: Maintaining social status in the face of repressions in Soviet Russia
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How does state-led repression targeting communities influence the social
> reproduction of victimized groups? Although several excellent studies have
> explored the sociopolitical consequences of a broad set of conflict-trauma
> legacies, notably, communal, religious and kinship drivers of responses to
> state violence, few researchers have explored the mechanisms of social status
> preservation under violence. The omission of class and social status from
> conflict research is puzzling considering that millions of people from
> Cambodia to China and from Russia to Hungary have suffered from state-led
> violence that targeted entire social groups and communities – from monks and
> priests with privileged positions in the social hierarchies, to the
> aristocracy and bourgeoisie. To generate theory about the mechanisms of social
> submission, adaptation or resistance in the face of group-based repressions,
> we explored the effects of Soviet repressions on the survival choices and
> reproduction of the Tzarist educated strata. For our analysis, we deployed
> subnational data on repressions and social structure and combined this with
> novel survey evidence and archival sources. We found that, contrary to
> conventional wisdom, repressions did not prevent the Imperial educated estates
> from engaging in habitual status- and identity-enhancing pursuits. Throughout
> the Soviet period, these groups continued to aspire to higher education and
> professional achievement. What is more, we show that continuity in pursuits
> was more common in places with more extensive repressions and a larger ‘stock’
> of pre-Revolutionary middle classes. We propose that in-group social bonding

> Title: Episodes of regime transformation
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article provides a new conceptualization of regime transformation that
> allows scholars to address democratization and autocratization as related but
> obverse processes. We introduce a dataset that captures 680 episodes of regime
> transformation (ERT) from 1900 to 2019 and offers novel insights into regime
> change over the past 120 years. The ERT has three main advantages over other
> approaches. First, it avoids problematic assumptions of unit homogeneity and
> constant as well as symmetric effects. Second, it integrates key insights from
> qualitative studies by treating regime change as a gradual and uncertain
> process. Third, the ERT is based on a unified framework for studying regime
> transformation in either direction. The dataset differentiates between four
> broad types of regime transformation: liberalization in autocracies,
> democratic deepening in democracies, and autocratization in both democracies
> and autocracies (democratic and autocratic regression). It further
> distinguishes ten patterns with distinct outcomes, including standard
> depictions of regime change (i.e. democratic transition or breakdown). A
> minority (32%) of ERTs produce a regime transition, with the majority of
> episodes either ending before a transition takes place or not having the
> potential for such a transition (i.e. further democratization in democratic
> regimes or further autocratization in autocratic regimes). We also provide
> comparisons to other datasets, illustrative case studies to demonstrate face
> validity, and a discussion about how the ERT framework can be applied in peace
> research.

> Some caveats:
> 
>   * Again, we attribute all the change in PM2.5 in 2020 (relative to 5-yr avg) as due to wildfire. While this is probably not fully correct, the big spikes were definitely from wildfires. Further analysis will help clarify this. 
>   * PM2.5 from wildfire smoke might not have the same effect as overall PM2.5 (only some of which comes from wildfire). The science isn't clear on this yet. 
>   * We are in the midst of the COVID pandemic, and this has as-yet-unknown implications for our understanding of how air pollution affects health outcomes. Early evidence seems to suggest that poor air quality could worsen COVID-related outcomes, and if that's the case then our numbers above could be lower bounds. 
>   * Numbers above only look at elderly mortality and ER visits, and it's likely that other groups are very substantially affected (e.g. the very young, those with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions). Again, above numbers likely a dramatic lower bound on overall health consequences for that reason. 
>   * We don't know a ton about health responses at super high exposures. Does it tail off? Does it get way worse? You can find papers telling you both. Right now we're assuming response is linear, which is consistent with a lot of the literature. 
>   * We also don't have a full picture of "displacement" - i.e. if someone passes away due to air pollution exposure, maybe they were already extremely sick and so would have passed away in the near term anyway. Deryugina et al explore this to some degree by looking at 3-day (and longer) responses to a single day of pollution increase. They find effects of 1-day exposure over the next month to be about twice as big as the 3-day estimates we use, so again this could suggest our numbers are a lower bound. 
>   * Effects could also amplify over time, as its probably the case that exposure to 7 days in a row of terrible air is worse that exposure to 7 days spread out. Our numbers do not consider this, nor do we know of good estimates in the literature that would help with this. Please point them out if so!

> Title: A spatiotemporal analysis of ungulate–vehicle collision hotspots in response to road construction and realignment
> Description: Although roads are central to human society, they have many negative
> environmental impacts and create risk for traveling motorists. Our aim was to
> evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of ungulate–vehicle collision (UVC)
> hotspots in response to major road construction. We examined two different
> locations and scales in the province of Alberta, Canada: (1) a highway bypass
> adjacent to a large city with 4.5 km of wildlife mitigation measures (wildlife
> fencing and two underpasses) and (2) 55 km of rural highway that was converted
> from a two-lane to a four-lane divided highway. Using government police
> collision and carcass data (2000–2021), before-after and control-impact
> analyses were used to assess changes in UVC rates. Our approach is novel in
> that we tested the paired use of a clustering method known as kernel density
> estimation plus and a spatiotemporal stepwise modification of this method to
> monitor UVC hotspots. By monitoring UVCs over space and time, we could
> identify stable vs. ephemeral UVC hotspots, a fence-end effect, and a barrier
> effect due to traffic volume, and we could explore hotspot stability before
> and after construction. The wildlife mitigation measures along the highway
> bypass resulted in 86% fewer UVCs compared to an unmitigated highway. At a
> larger scale, however, net benefits were affected by road density. The
> construction of a four-lane divided highway with no wildlife mitigation
> measures and an increase in the posted speed limit resulted in a slight
> increase in UVCs and the reemergence of the majority of historical UVC
> hotspots. Our analysis highlighted the need to incorporate wildlife

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today's memo highlights significant interdisciplinary findings that align with my interests in sustainability, ecological modeling, and sociopolitical dynamics. Notably, breakthroughs in ecological modeling, neurobiology, and social resilience under state violence are discussed. These diverse findings underscore the interconnected nature of sustainability, human behavior, and ecological processes, suggesting ongoing directions for research and policy development.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Ecological Modeling and Biomass Estimation:**
>    The integration of the CENTURY model with vulnerability assessment indices to estimate aboveground biomass and assess ecological vulnerability in grasslands, particularly in the Northwest Sichuan Plateau, offers insights into sustainable land management and climate adaptation strategies [2].
> 
> - **Neurobiological Mechanisms of Memory:**
>    A study reveals how the same brain cells represent both perception and memory of faces, advancing our understanding of neural mechanisms and memory formation, a crucial aspect of cognitive neurosciences [4].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **State-Led Repression and Social Resilience:**
>    Research on Soviet Russia's repression and its impact on the social status and adaptive strategies of victimized groups illuminates how communities maintain social structures under extreme conditions [10]. Keep an eye on similar dynamics in current conflict zones and post-conflict societies.
> 
> - **Species Occupancy Estimation Challenges:**
>    The trade-off between accuracy and spatial resolution in species occupancy estimation from geographically biased samples highlights critical concerns in ecological modeling and biodiversity conservation [9]. This is crucial for refining data collection methods and improving conservation practices.
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Evolution of Parenting Behaviors:**
>    Discoveries about novel adrenal cell types in the oldfield mouse promoting parenting behavior suggest evolutionary pathways for social behaviors [5]. Understanding these mechanisms can inform conservation biology and the study of social species.
> 
> - **Marine Ecosystem Changes:**
>    Long-term studies on the response of meso- and macro-zooplankton communities to environmental changes in the North Sea reveal significant reorganizations of marine ecosystems due to climate change and human activities [8]. This has implications for fisheries management and marine conservation policies.
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Ecological Modeling and Grassland Vulnerability**
> The study by Huayun He et al. [2] integrates the CENTURY model with a vulnerability assessment index to estimate aboveground biomass and assess ecological vulnerability in the Northwest Sichuan Plateau. This region faces significant ecological challenges due to climate and anthropogenic pressures. By combining process-based modeling with vulnerability indices, the research provides a more nuanced understanding of grassland ecosystems' health. This approach can inform sustainable land management practices and enhance resilience against climate change.
> 
> ### **Neurobiological Insights into Memory Encoding**
> The research published in *Nature* [4] on how the same brain regions in macaques represent both the perception and memory of faces is groundbreaking. It shows that familiar faces are encoded using a distinct neural code separate from sensory representation. These findings could pave the way for improved understanding of memory disorders and the development of cognitive training or rehabilitation methods focused on memory enhancement.
>

These findings contribute to broader conflict and social resilience literature, offering lessons applicable to contemporary contexts of state violence and societal adaptation.
