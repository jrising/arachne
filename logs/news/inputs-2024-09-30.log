> ### **Mental Health Insights**
> Recent studies reveal significant neurological changes in individuals suffering from depression. The frontostriatal salience network, which is involved in processing environmental stimuli, expands significantly in individuals with depression. This persistent alteration, even pre-symptoms in children, points to potential early intervention strategies for mental health treatment [ID: 12188]. Understanding these changes can lead to improved diagnostics and tailored therapies, possibly preventing the onset or worsening of depressive disorders.
