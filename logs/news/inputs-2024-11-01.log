> *ENSO Complexity and Climate Models*
> 
> The research highlighted in multiple papers points to the intricate ways in which ENSO complexity affects global climate patterns. By perturbing initial values and parameters, scientists are gaining insights into ENSO behavior over the past 36 years, which is crucial under current climate change scenarios [12897]. Additionally, the combined effects of ENSO and QBO on the stratosphere suggest that these interactions may significantly influence future weather phenomena and climate projections [12273]. These studies underscore the necessity for integrating complex climatic interactions into predictive models to foster informed policy-making and global sustainability efforts.
