> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Can representation in foreign policy deliberations – in particular, increased

> ‘listen in’ on a hypothetical national security deliberation that was either
> all-male or gender-mixed. I find that politicians’ decisionmaking in these
> hypothetical committees was informed simultaneously by notions of committee
> competence and by inferences about the social desirability of hawkish outcomes
> in deliberative settings. Specifically, respondents assigned to gender-mixed
> committees became less supportive of external conflict resolution. I show how
> different mechanisms accounted for this increased hawkishness for men and
> women. Female politicians assigned to gender-mixed committees became more
> conscious and wary of how their participation, the result of increased
> representation, would be perceived, compelling them to opt for more hawkish

> NPS seek to take a data-driven approach to resolving a number of empirical
> issues that come up in our earlier work. These include: (1) Does temperature
> affect the level or growth rate of GDP? (2) What is the "right" set of fixed
> effects or time trends to include as controls in analyzing the effect of
> temperature on GDP? (3) And what is the "right" functional form to describe
> the relationship between temperature and GDP changes? These choices --
> particularly (1) and (3) -- are certainly influential in the findings of
> earlier studies. If temperature affects growth rates rather than levels, this
> can imply huge effects of future temperature increases on economic output, as
> small impacts on growth aggregate over time. If temperature has a globally
> nonlinear effect on output, as we argue in BHM, this suggests that both
> wealthy and poor countries can be affected by changes in temperature -- and
> not only poor countries, as suggested in earlier analyses. Resolving these
> questions is key to understanding the impacts of a warming climate, and its
> great that papers like NPS are taking them on.
> 
> However, we have some serious qualms with the approach that NPS take to answer
> these questions. NPS wish to use cross-validation to select which set of the
> above choices performs "best" in describing historical data. Cross-validation
> is a technique in which available data are split between disjoint training and

>   1. _The change in the age specific mortality rate per unit change in PM2.5_ . For this we use estimates from [ He et al 2016 ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069616300237) , who studied the effects of air quality improvements around the Beijing Olympics on mortality rates -- a quasi-experimental setting on air quality not unlike that induced by COVID-19. He et al found large reductions in mortality for children under five and for adults over 65, with monthly under-5 mortality increasing 2.9% for every 1ug/m3 increase in PM2.5, and about 1.4% for people over 70 years old (note: they measure impacts using PM10, and to convert to PM2.5 we use the common assumption in the literature that PM2.5 = 0.7*PM10 and that all impacts of PM10 are through the PM2.5 component). Estimates from the He et al paper are broadly consistent with other quasi-experimental studies on the effects of air pollution on infant health, including estimates from the US, Turkey, and Africa (see Fig 5b [ here ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26107.pdf) ). As a more conservative approach, we also calculate mortality using 1% increase in mortality per 1ug increase in PM2.5 for both kids and older people. In all cases, we very conservatively assume that no one between the ages of 5 and 70 is affected. 
>   2. _The baseline age-specific mortality rates for kids and older people_ , which we take from [ Global Burden of Disease estimates ](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/) . I note a large apparent discrepancy between the GBD numbers, which give an under-5 mortality rate of 205 per 100,000 live births in China in the most recent year, and the [ WB/Unicef estimate ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?locations=CN) , which puts the number at 860 per 100,000 live births (4x higher!). I use the much smaller GBD estimate in my calculations to be conservative, but someone should reconcile these... 
>   3. The total population affected by the changes in air pollution. For this we take the total Chinese population as [ estimated by the UN ](https://population.un.org/wpp/DataQuery/) , and conservatively assume that only 50% of the population are affected by the change in air quality. Since roughly 60% of Chinese live in urban areas, this is like assuming there is no effect in rural areas and some urban areas remain unaffected.

> What are some of the key assumptions in my overall analysis? There are lots:
> 
>   * This is only the partial effect of air pollution; it is by no means the overall effect of COVID-19 on mortality. Indeed, the broader disruption caused by COVID-19 could cause many additional deaths that are not directly attributable to being infected with the virus -- e.g. due to declines in households' economic wellbeing, or to the difficulty in accessing health services for non-COVID illnesses. Again, I am absolutely not saying that pandemics are good for health. 
>   * The key assumption in using the He et al 2016 estimates (or the 1%/1ug conservative summary estimate from quasi-experimental studies) is that changes in outdoor PM2.5 concentrations are a sufficient statistic for measuring health impacts. One worry is that, instead of being at work, people are staying at home, and that home indoor air pollution is worse than what they would have been exposed to otherwise. While it is true that indoor air pollution can be incredibly high in homes that rely on biomass burning for cooking and heating, existing evidence suggests that even in cold regions, urban Chinese residents probably have better air quality inside their home than outside it. E.g see [ here ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1309104217304300) . So the key question to me is whether other behaviors changed in response to COVID-19 that made individuals exposures look a lot different than they did in the Beijing setting in He et al 2016. Maybe there is a case to be made there but not sure what it is. There's a prima facie case that the Beijing setting looks a lot like what we're worried about here: an acute 2-month event that led to large but temporary changes in air pollution. 
>   * Is mortality from COVID-19 interacting with mortality from PM? One possibility is that there are enough COVID-19 infections to actually make people more susceptible to the negative impacts of air pollution. But this would increase rather than decrease deaths from PM! The other possibility is that the people who have very sadly passed away from COVID would have been those most likely to pass away from PM exposure. But even if this were 100% true, it would only account for ~5% of the overall predicted mortality. 
>   * We are pinning the entire PM2.5 difference between Jan-Feb 2020 and Jan-Feb 2016-19 on COVID-19. (Note that we estimate a 17ug/m3 difference, and have rounded that down to 10 ug/mg, so in effect are only pinning about 60% of the change on COVID). Without more careful analysis, we can't really know whether this is fair or not. Maybe something else very big was going on at exactly the same time in China? Seems unlikely but my analysis has nothing to say about that. 
>   * **My estimates are a prediction of mortality impacts, not a measurement. They are not proof that anything has happened** . In a few years, there will likely be enough data to actually try to measure what the overall effect was of the COVID-19 epidemic on health outcomes. You could compare changes in mortality in high-exposure locations to changes in mortality in lower-exposure locations, for instance. But this study is not yet possible, as the epidemic is still underway and the comprehensive all-cause mortality data not yet (to my knowledge) available.
