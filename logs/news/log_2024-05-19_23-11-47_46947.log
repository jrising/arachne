> Title: Fiscal conditions for multiparty elections in dictatorships
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Multiparty elections can reduce the likelihood of conflict and help dictators
> secure their rule, but when does a dictator create electoral institutions?
> Existing research finds that one of the major reasons regimes introduce
> multiparty elections is to gain information about opposition demands. This
> article builds on that argument to explain that a regime’s finances determine
> whether or not it is able to benefit from creating electoral institutions.
> Dictators use the revenue of the regime to invest in different means of
> deterring opposition rebellion. A regime’s first priority is to build
> repressive capacity, after which it invests in public spending to buy the
> support of its winning coalition. Regimes only benefit from multiparty
> elections when they have sufficient revenue to fund repressive capacity but
> lack the finances to also buy regime security through massive public spending.
> Low-revenue regimes cannot benefit from elections and high-revenue regimes do
> not need elections to help secure their rule. I test the implications of the
> argument for regime spending and the creation of multiparty electoral
> institutions using a global sample of dictatorships between 1972 and 2014. The
> results of the hypothesis tests indicate that as revenue increases regimes
> decrease their shares of spending on repressive capacity but increase shares
> of spending on the public. The results also indicate the probability that a
> regime introduces elections rises as revenue increases from a low level, but
> the probability declines as revenue increases from a high level. The study
> builds upon the literature for how regime resources and state capacity
> influence authoritarian strategies of political survival. The findings for
> spending patterns are consistent with recent research on late modern regimes,
> and the results for the emergence of electoral institutions are consistent
> with research that finds dictators must have sufficient resources to survive
> holding elections.

> Title: Decadal (2010–2019) variability in the marine ecosystems of the North Atlantic
> Description: Abstract
> 
> The “Symposium on Decadal Variability of the North Atlantic and its Marine
> Ecosystems: 2010–2019” took place in Bergen, Norway, from 20 to 22 May 2022.
> This event, hosted by the Institute of Marine Research, was jointly sponsored
> by ICES and NAFO and constitutes the fourth in a series of these symposia that
> started in 1991. The first symposium’s aim was to review the hydrobiological
> variability in the decade of the 1980s, addressing the physical environment,
> plankton, invertebrates, and fish. Subsequent symposia maintained the
> classical structure, whilst a new theme session covering social sciences was
> added to the programme in the 2022 edition. Studies of climate impacts on
> marine ecosystems and living marine resources, including trends and regime
> shifts, emerged from increasingly longer ecosystem time series across the
> North Atlantic and subarctic regions. This symposium collection presents key
> findings discussed during the symposium. Whilst some progress has been made in
> advancing our ability to understand new trends and patterns of climate change
> and variability across physical, plankton, and fish communities, more work is
> needed to integrate these physical-ecological processes and scales with social
> science.

> Title: Militarized state-building interventions and the survival of fragile states

> Militarized state-building interventions (MSIs) must fulfill two often

**assistant**:
> Given your interdisciplinary interests, James, the following selections from the RSS feed items not only stand out in terms of importance but also align cohesively around themes of sustainability, technological advancement, and global governance—areas that are likely to resonate with both your professional and personal interests. This summary focuses on developments related to environmental sustainability, technological innovations in robotics and space debris, and insights into global and authoritarian governance mechanisms.

> ### Technological Innovations and Environmental Challenges
> 
> **Title:** Modular multi-degree-of-freedom soft origami robots with reprogrammable electrothermal actuation  
> **Source:** Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 121, Issue 20, May 2024  
> **Summary:** This article introduces advanced soft origami robots that exhibit multi-degree-of-freedom with reprogrammable electrothermal actuation. Such innovations could significantly impact fields ranging from rescue missions to minimally invasive surgery, emphasizing the importance of advancements in robotics on sustainability and human well-being.
> 
> **Title:** There Is Too Much Trash in Space  
> **Source:** Scientific American  
> **Summary:** Space debris poses a burgeoning threat to the space economy and satellite safety, highlighting a critical need for a global agreement to ensure space remains a sustainable environment. This reflects the broader challenge of managing the commons, whether in outer space or on Earth, emphasizing the necessity of international cooperation in maintaining the viability of critical frontiers.
> 
> ### Insights into Global Governance and Authoritarianism
> 
> **Title:** Fiscal conditions for multiparty elections in dictatorships  
> **Source:** Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print  
> **Summary:** This study explores the economic underpinnings that influence dictatorships' decision to implement multiparty elections. It reveals that such decisions are often strategic, aimed at optimizing the regime's stability when facing financial constraints, providing a nuanced understanding of how authoritarian regimes balance between repression and concession to maintain power.
> 
> **Title:** Leader or lackey? Understanding the United Nations Secretary-General’s role in conflict diplomacy  
> **Source:** Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print  
> **Summary:** Investigating the autonomy of the UN Secretary-General (SG) in conflict diplomacy, this research dispels the notion that the SG is merely an extension of the powerful UN Security Council permanent members (P5). Findings suggest the SG can, and does, act independently, making substantive contributions to peacekeeping and conflict resolution efforts, and underscoring the complex interplay between international organizations and global governance.
> 
> These articles collectively offer a glimpse into the critical intersections between technology, environmental challenges, and global governance strategies. They underscore the evolving nature of global challenges, from the management of space debris to the strategic governance choices of authoritarian regimes, and the continuous innovation in technology that offers solutions and also presents new questions for sustainability and international cooperation.
