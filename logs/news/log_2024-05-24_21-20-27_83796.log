> Title: Blessing or curse? Assessing the local impacts of foreign direct investment on conflict in Africa
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> The question of foreign direct investment (FDI) and socio-political
> development is debated heavily. Liberals believe that FDI brings economic
> opportunities and/or increased incentives for peace and security among host
> societies. Critics suggest that FDI is exploitative, leading to conditions
> that increase the risk of violence. We take a political economy perspective
> that views FDI as problematic depending on how FDI affects politically
> powerful local interests. As such, all forms of FDI should meet domestic
> opposition, but only FDI in the extractive sector, where domestic political
> actors have little at stake, escalates to major war. Building on recent work
> which examines this question pertaining to extractive sector FDI, we introduce
> sub-national, geo-referenced data on FDI in all sectors for evaluating local
> conflict using combined data from four distinct geo-referenced conflict
> databases. Using site-period fixed effects with a difference-in-difference
> like approach, we find that FDI in all sectors increases local conflict.
> Conflicts induced by most FDI sectors fall short of becoming civil war, except
> for extractive sector FDI.

> Title: Leader similarity and international conflict
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Scholars increasingly emphasize personal biographical characteristics of
> leaders in explaining patterns of foreign policy behavior. This article
> extends insights from this agenda to study how (dis)similarities in the
> background characteristics of leaders at the dyadic level shape international
> conflict outcomes. Trust and uncertainty are central to explaining conflict
> via their connections to commitment- and information-related causes of war.
> Psychological research provides evidence that perceived similarities between
> individuals and groups can foment trust and cooperation. We hypothesize that
> leaders who share more similar backgrounds and life experiences form stronger
> social bonds and are more trusting of one another. As such, leaders who have
> more in common with one another should be able to better manage diplomatic
> disputes and avoid conflict. We test this hypothesis using a new measure of
> dyadic-leader-level similarity created with the Leader Experience and
> Attribute Descriptions (LEAD) dataset and data on international conflict onset
> in politically relevant dyads throughout the period 1946–2004. We find that
> pairs of leaders with more similar backgrounds are significantly less likely
> to experience militarized interstate disputes at all levels of hostility even
> after accounting for a variety of observable and unobservable determinants of
> conflict. The findings contribute to our understanding of the determinants of
> international conflict and help advance research on linkages between
> psychological and rationalist approaches to studying conflict.

> Title: Polls of fear? Electoral violence, incumbent strength, and voter turnout in Côte d’Ivoire
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How, and under what conditions, does electoral violence influence voter
> turnout? Existing research often presumes that electoral violence demobilizes
> voters, but we lack knowledge of the conditions under which violence depresses
> turnout. This study takes a subnational approach to probe the moderating
> effect of local incumbent strength on the association between electoral
> violence and turnout. Based on existing work, I argue that electoral violence
> can reduce voter turnout by heightening threat perceptions among voters and
> eroding public trust in the electoral system, thereby raising the expected
> costs of voting and undermining the belief that one’s vote matters. Moreover,
> I propose that in elections contested across multiple local rather than a
> single national voting district, the negative effect of electoral violence on
> turnout should be greater in districts where the incumbent is stronger. This
> is because when the incumbent is stronger, voters have lesser strategic and
> purposive incentives to vote than voters in localities where the opposition is
> stronger. I test the argument by combining original subnational event data on
> electoral violence before Côte d’Ivoire’s 2021 legislative elections with
> electoral records. The results support the main hypothesis and indicate that
> electoral violence was associated with significantly lower voter turnout in
> voting districts where the incumbent was stronger, but not where the
> opposition was stronger. The study contributes new knowledge on the conditions
> under which electoral violence depresses voter turnout, and suggests that
> voters in opposition strongholds can be more resilient to electoral violence
> than often assumed.

> Title: The bridge to violence – Mapping and understanding conflict-related violence in postwar Mitrovica
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How can attention to spatial dynamics improve our understanding of where, how,
> and why conflict-related violence (CRV) concentrates within postwar cities
> such as Mitrovica? Like many other postwar cities, Mitrovica – one of Kosovo’s
> largest cities – remains affected by violence connected to the preceding war.
> This violence is not equally distributed across the city but rather
> concentrates to certain flashpoints while other sites are comparatively
> calm(er). To date, however, research on postwar cities has not fully explained
> such patterns, partly due to limitations in microlevel data. In this article
> we rely on novel georeferenced data on CRV, in combination with in-depth
> fieldwork, to map CRV in Mitrovica and explore the causes for its spatial
> clustering. Using this approach, we show that CRV concentrates at Mitrovica’s
> Main Bridge and explore this concentration using relational space as an
> analytical lens. The analysis contributes new insights into patterns of
> violence in Mitrovica, demonstrates the value of combining systematic data on
> the patterns of CRV with in-depth exploration into its underlying dynamics,
> and contributes to existing research on Mitrovica as well as on postwar cities
> and postwar violence more broadly.

> Title: Asymmetric burden-sharing and the restraining and deterrence effects of alliances
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Alliances are often presumed to serve the dual purpose of restraint and
> deterrence, though few existing studies examine their relationship and the
> connection with defense burden-sharing. This research employs a three-player
> game-theoretic model, which endogenizes the process of alliance formation and
> arms buildups, to demonstrate how intra-alliance burden-sharing allows the
> alliance to preserve the status quo. The results suggest that alliance burden-
> sharing may exert the deterrence and restraining effects, while at most one
> effect is observable at a time because the effects occur in separate parameter
> spaces. If a prospective ally’s cost of arms buildups is relatively low, a
> status-quo-oriented superpower may form an alliance even by shouldering a
> disproportionately heavy burden to dissuade the ally from overturning the
> status quo (the restraining effect). Conversely, if the cost is relatively
> high, the superpower may form an alliance to protect the ally from external
> threats (the deterrence effect). However, to prevent being exploited by this
> ally, the superpower provides only the units of armed forces that are
> sufficient to incentivize the ally to bolster its military capabilities to
> deter the threats. Their alliance entails power aggrandizement, but it does
> not provoke a non-signatory as the ally remains too weak to act unilaterally.

> Title: Human rights violations and public support for sanctions
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Public pressure to take punitive action against human rights violators is
> often a driving force behind international sanctions. However, we know little
> about the way in which public support is shaped by varying types of abuse, the
> costs and effectiveness of sanctions and the differential harm they inflict
> upon the target population and leadership. Our study specifically addresses
> this gap by unpicking contextual factors that jointly sway the perception of
> morality and the cost-benefit calculus. We propose that there is no simple
> trade-off between instrumental and moral concerns. The context within which
> violations take place and the interactions between moral and instrumental
> dimensions shape preference formation. Findings from our paired conjoint
> experiment suggest that whether respondents support imposing sanctions depends
> on the category of human rights abuse and its perceived salience. Individuals
> also prefer sheltering the target population while punishing the leadership,
> but collective punishment becomes less unacceptable if the majority of the
> target population support the human rights infringements. The desire to do
> something against the perpetrators amplifies the appeal of punishing the
> leadership but assuages the moral concerns of harming the population.

> Title: Pulling through elections by pulling the plug: Internet disruptions and electoral violence in Uganda
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Does increasing Internet access and use challenge authoritarian elections? I
> argue that Internet access provides both opposition supporters and government

> > in a detailed analysis of county-level productivity, a colleague at

> > Importantly, these numbers are not a complete accounting of impacts and
> > other notable studies report larger losses.
> 
> > **Second, extreme weather events are short-lived, but their economic impact
> > is long-lasting.** Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and fires destroy assets
> > that took communities years to build. Rebuilding then diverts resources away
> > from new productive investments that would have otherwise supported future
> > growth. For example, a colleague at Rhodium Group and I estimated that
> > Hurricane Maria set Puerto Rico back over two decades of progress; and
> > research from MIT indicates that communities in the Great Plains have still
> > not fully recovered from the Dustbowl of the 1930s. As climate change makes
> > extreme events more intense and frequent, we will spend more attention and
> > more money replacing depreciated assets and repairing communities.
> 
> > **Third, the nature and magnitude of projected costs differs between
> > locations and industries** . For example, extreme heat will impose large
> > health, energy, and labor costs on the South; sea level rise and hurricanes
> > will damage the Gulf Coast; and declining crop yields will transform the
> > Plains and Midwest.
> 
> > **Fourth, because low income regions and individuals tend to be hurt more,
> > climate change will widen existing economic inequality.** For example, in a
> > national analysis of many sectors, the poorest counties suffered median
> > losses that were 9 times larger than the richest.
> 
> > **Fifth, many impacts of climate change will not be felt in the marketplace,
> > but rather in homes where health, happiness, and freedom from violence will
> > be affected.** There are many examples of this. Mortality due to extreme
> > heat is projected to rise dramatically. Increasingly humid summers are
> > projected to degrade happiness  and sleep quality. Research from Harvard
> > indicates that warming will likely elevate violent crime nationwide,
> > producing over 180,000 sexual assaults and over 22,000 murders across eight
> > decades. Colleagues at Stanford and I estimate that warming will generate

> > exposure of pregnant mothers to extreme heat and cyclones will harm fetuses
> > for their lifetime. These impacts do not easily convert to dollars and
> > cents, but they still merit attention.
>

> > some will require constructing new defensive infrastructure, and some will
> > involve abandoning communities and industries where opportunities have
> > deteriorated. In all cases, these adaptations will come at real cost, since
> > resources expended on coping cannot be invested elsewhere.

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today's memo focuses on emerging strategies for global sustainability and socio-political stability, emphasizing the innovative use of resources and examining the impact of socio-political dynamics on conflict and peace. This brief provides insights into creative recycling methods, the socio-political implications of foreign investments in conflict-prone areas, and the intersection of modern governance challenges such as internet access and electoral violence.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Sustainable E-Waste Recycling with Beer Yeast**: Researchers have discovered that yeast used in brewing beer can also be repurposed to help recycle metals from electronic waste, offering a novel and sustainable approach to managing e-waste [1].
> - **Foreign Direct Investment and Conflict in Africa**: An in-depth study shows that foreign direct investment (FDI) can increase local conflict in Africa, especially in the extractive sectors where domestic political stakes are low [2].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Innovative Recycling Techniques**: The use of beer yeast in e-waste recycling could revolutionize how we manage electronic waste, aligning with sustainability goals and circular economy principles. Look for developments in scaling this technology and its adoption in industrial applications [1].
> - **Impact of Internet Access on Electoral Violence**: The dual role of internet access in both empowering opposition and being a tool for governmental repression highlights the nuanced impact of technology in authoritarian regimes. Monitoring how this dynamic unfolds in upcoming elections in similar contexts will be crucial [16].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Electoral Violence in Côte d’Ivoire**: Analysis reveals that electoral violence significantly lowers voter turnout in regions with strong incumbents but has less impact in opposition strongholds, underscoring the need for targeted electoral reforms [5].
> - **Internet Use and Well-being**: A global survey indicates that internet use might boost life satisfaction and sense of purpose, suggesting potential policy implications for increasing digital access as a public good [14].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Sustainability and Conflict**
> 
> Innovative solutions for global sustainability are emerging from unexpected sectors. The repurposing of beer yeast to recycle metals from e-waste [1] exemplifies how industrial by-products can be redirected to address pressing environmental challenges. This aligns with the broader trend towards a circular economy where waste from one process becomes a resource for another, thereby reducing overall environmental impact.
> 
> Conversely, the socio-political landscape in many developing regions complicates efforts towards sustainable development. For instance, foreign direct investment, often viewed as a catalyst for economic growth, can inadvertently exacerbate local conflicts, especially in sectors like mining where local interests are marginalized [2]. This calls for a more nuanced approach to FDI, one that carefully considers local political dynamics and ensures that investments benefit local communities equitably.
> 
> The complexities of governance are further highlighted by the role of internet access in electoral contexts. In Uganda, internet access provided tools for opposition mobilization but also enabled governmental repression during elections, resulting in targeted electoral violence [16]. This dual-edged nature of technology poses challenges for policy-makers who must balance the benefits of digital access with the risks of its potential misuse.
> 
> Sustained peace and development require innovations both in technology and governance. Sustainable resource management techniques and mindful political strategies can play complementary roles in fostering stability and growth.
