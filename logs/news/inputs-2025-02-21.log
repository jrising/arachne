> The fields of genomics and biotechnology are rapidly advancing, with significant implications for both agriculture and medicine. For instance, ancient genomics research provides insights into the evolution and dispersal of domestic sheep, which is crucial for understanding long-term patterns in agricultural development [33290]. Meanwhile, in medicine, harnessing synthetic biology and genetic modification offers new solutions, such as the potential for using pig organs in human transplants, which could alleviate organ shortages [34960]. However, as highlighted by ethical concerns over synthetic biology [26810], these advancements also necessitate careful consideration of their long-term impacts on ecosystems and human society to ensure responsible stewardship of these powerful technologies.
