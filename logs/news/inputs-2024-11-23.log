> ### **Memory and Brain Function**
> Recent research in Nature underscores the importance of astrocytes in memory function. The study demonstrated that specific learning-associated astrocytes in the hippocampus are vital for memory recall, suggesting that astrocytes may play a more active role in cognitive processes than previously understood [21011]. This emerging understanding could inform future neurological and cognitive disorder treatments.
