> ### **Rapa Nui’s Population History**
> Recent studies utilizing ancient genomes from Rapa Nui (Easter Island) have provided new insights into the island's history. Contrary to the previously held belief that the island's population suffered a self-inflicted collapse before European contact, these new findings suggest otherwise. This breakthrough in understanding could reshape how we view the historical narrative of Easter Island [13085].
> 
> ### **Impact of Data Centers**
> As the demand for data storage grows, data centers are increasingly being built in various communities, sometimes catching residents off guard. These centers are known for their significant consumption of energy and water, as well as the noise they generate. The unforeseen impacts on local communities underline the need for better planning and communication with residents before such facilities are established [13761].
> 
> ### **Space Weather and Its Effects**
> Space weather, particularly geomagnetic storms, can significantly affect telecommunications, power grids, and satellite operations. Currently, the system for categorizing these storms on a scale from one to five is inadequate for predicting once-in-a-century superstorms. Experts are advocating for a more sophisticated warning system to mitigate the potential widespread disruption these events could cause [73].
> 
> ### **Childhood Mobility and Mental Health**
> A Danish study involving over a million individuals has found that frequent moves during childhood can lead to higher rates of depression in adulthood, even more so than economic hardship. This finding suggests that stability in a child’s environment is crucial for their long-term mental health [4774].
