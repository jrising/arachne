> ### **Potential of JAK Inhibition for Cancer Therapy**
> 
> Recent findings indicate that JAK inhibitors could be game-changers in cancer immunotherapy. The efficacy of itacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, when used in conjunction with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, has shown promising results in non-small cell lung cancer patients [1658], potentially overcoming cytokine-driven immunosuppression. A parallel study on Hodgkin lymphoma patients similarly underscores the benefits of combining JAK inhibition with checkpoint blockade to unleash antitumor T cell activity [1659]. These advancements highlight the growing importance of targeted immunomodulatory therapies in oncology.
