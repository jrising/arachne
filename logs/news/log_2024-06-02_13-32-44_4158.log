> Title: The bridge to violence – Mapping and understanding conflict-related violence in postwar Mitrovica
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How can attention to spatial dynamics improve our understanding of where, how,
> and why conflict-related violence (CRV) concentrates within postwar cities
> such as Mitrovica? Like many other postwar cities, Mitrovica – one of Kosovo’s
> largest cities – remains affected by violence connected to the preceding war.
> This violence is not equally distributed across the city but rather
> concentrates to certain flashpoints while other sites are comparatively
> calm(er). To date, however, research on postwar cities has not fully explained
> such patterns, partly due to limitations in microlevel data. In this article
> we rely on novel georeferenced data on CRV, in combination with in-depth
> fieldwork, to map CRV in Mitrovica and explore the causes for its spatial
> clustering. Using this approach, we show that CRV concentrates at Mitrovica’s
> Main Bridge and explore this concentration using relational space as an
> analytical lens. The analysis contributes new insights into patterns of
> violence in Mitrovica, demonstrates the value of combining systematic data on
> the patterns of CRV with in-depth exploration into its underlying dynamics,
> and contributes to existing research on Mitrovica as well as on postwar cities
> and postwar violence more broadly.

> Title: Structural adjustment, partisan alignment, and protest in the developing world
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> When do IMF programs induce protest? Despite much cross-country research on
> this question, there is little evidence on how IMF programs affect individual
> predispositions for protest and protest behavior. This article argues that
> governments facing IMF conditionality allocate adjustment burdens
> strategically, protecting their partisan supporters while punishing supporters
> of the political opposition. This intensification of distributional politics
> under IMF programs will increase protests by opposition supporters. To test
> this argument, we utilize a mixed-method strategy combining individual-level
> survey evidence from 12 sub-Saharan African countries and an intertemporal
> case study of Kenya. The results find strong evidence for our argument.
> Opposition supporters are significantly more likely to protest when a
> government goes under an IMF program, especially when the program entails
> public-sector conditions. Our analysis suggests that governments are not
> innocent bystanders in the adjustment process. Instead, they co-determine
> inclinations for protest by deciding over the allocation of adjustment burdens
> to the detriment of opposition groups and the benefit of their supporters.
> These results have important implications for the role of governments as

> Title: Trauma in world politics: Memory dynamics between different victim groups
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> While the international arena is littered with events of war and atrocities,
> the memory of the Holocaust was institutionalized as the ultimate benchmark of
> human suffering within the liberal world order. Against the backdrop of such a
> global memory landscape, this article explores how different memories of
> trauma interact. Building on literature within international relations,
> sociology and social psychology, as well as survey data collected from a
> sample of Syrians, Palestinians and Israelis, its analysis explores how
> victims of political violence compare their suffering with that of others and
> why such comparisons slip easily into competition. The analysis found that
> individuals were competitive with their memories when they showed high levels
> of patriotic attachment and a real and perceived, yet unrecognized, sense of
> victimhood. This article thus offers insight into a key issue in peace and
> conflict studies: the links between traumatic memory, victimhood,
> international recognition and conflict.

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today we're diving into the spatial dynamics affecting conflict-related violence in postwar cities, climate-induced protests, and innovative methods to build better climate damage functions. These insights are crucial for developing a more nuanced understanding of global sustainability challenges and the complex socio-political responses they elicit.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Conflict-Related Violence in Postwar Mitrovica**: The article explores how spatial dynamics influence the concentration of conflict-related violence (CRV) within postwar cities like Mitrovica, Kosovo. Using georeferenced data and fieldwork, the study identifies Mitrovica’s Main Bridge as a key flashpoint, offering new insights into the patterns of violence and their underlying causes [164].
> - **IMF Programs and Protests**: This research uncovers the strategic allocation of economic burdens by governments under IMF conditionality, which tends to increase protests among opposition supporters. The study uses evidence from sub-Saharan Africa and a case study of Kenya to support its findings [95].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Climate Damages and Inequality**: The construction of a micro-founded climate damage function highlights significant details on economic impacts across various sectors in the USA, and how these impacts might exacerbate existing inequalities. This paper could provide vital inputs for policy design and social cost of carbon calculations [258].
> - **Extreme Precipitation in Borneo**: An intriguing study investigates why extreme precipitation episodes occur in Borneo during both El Niño and La Niña winters, challenging existing beliefs about the El Niño-Southern Oscillation's effects on regional climate patterns [1042].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **U.S. Policy on Ukraine Strikes**: The U.S. Secretary of State hinted that Ukraine might be granted more latitude to use American-supplied arms for strikes beyond the Kharkiv area, potentially escalating the conflict [841].
> - **Structural Adjustments and Social Unrest**: Countries undergoing IMF-induced structural adjustments might experience heightened social unrest, particularly when government policies disproportionately affect opposition supporters. This could have broad implications for international financial policy and stability [95].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Spatial Dynamics in Postwar Conflict Zones**
> The concentration of CRV in specific areas within postwar cities like Mitrovica offers a rich field of study for understanding urban violence. The novel use of spatial analysis combined with georeferenced data provides insights that could guide better policy interventions in similar contexts [164].
> 
> ### **Building a Better Climate Damage Function**
> Efforts to create an empirically validated climate damage function represent a significant advance in quantifying the economic impacts of climate change. By integrating high-resolution climate models and empirical response functions, this approach provides a robust framework for understanding and potentially mitigating climate-related economic damages [258].
> 
> In conclusion, these studies offer critical insights into the dynamics of conflict and climate change, equipping policymakers with the data needed to address these complex issues effectively. Keep an eye on how these findings will shape future research and policy interventions in their respective fields.
