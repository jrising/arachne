> Title: A values-centered relational science model: supporting Indigenous rights and reconciliation in research
> Description: Addressing complex social-ecological issues requires all relevant sources of
> knowledge and data, especially those held by communities who remain close to
> the land. Centuries of oppression, extractive research practices, and
> misrepresentation have hindered balanced knowledge exchange with Indigenous
> communities and inhibited innovation and problem-solving capacity in all
> scientific fields. A recent shift in the research landscape reflects a growing
> interest in engaging across diverse communities and ways of knowing.
> Scientific discussions increasingly highlight the inherent value of Indigenous
> environmental ethics frameworks and processes as the original roadmaps for
> sustainable development planning, including their potential in addressing the
> climate crisis and related social and environmental concerns. Momentum in this
> shift is also propelled by an increasing body of research evidencing the role
> of Indigenous land stewardship for maintaining ecological health and
> biodiversity. However, a key challenge straining this movement lies rooted in
> colonial residue and ongoing actions that suppress and co-opt Indigenous
> knowledge systems. Scientists working with incomplete datasets privilege a
> handful of narratives, conceptual understandings, languages, and historical
> contexts, while failing to engage thousands of collective bodies of
> intergenerational, place-based knowledge systems. The current dominant
> colonial paradigm in scientific research risks continued harmful impacts to
> Indigenous communities that sustain diverse knowledge systems. Here, we
> outline how ethical standards in researcher practice can be raised in order to
> reconcile colonial legacies and ongoing settler colonial practices. We
> synthesize across Indigenous and community-based research protocols and
> frameworks, transferring knowledge across disciplines, and ground truthing
> methods and processes in our own practice, to present a relational science
> working model for supporting Indigenous rights and reconciliation in research.
> We maintain that core Indigenous values of integrity, respect, humility, and
> reciprocity should shape researcher responsibilities and methods applied in
> order to raise ethical standards and long-term relational accountability
> regarding Indigenous lands, rights, communities, and our shared futures.

> Title: Economic crisis and regime transitions from within
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Volume 61, Issue 3, Page 446-461, May 2024.  
> We study how economic crises relate to the likelihood of experiencing regime
> changes ‘from within’; that is, transitions brought about, in part or fully,
> by actors in the incumbent regime. While historically common and influencing
> the political trajectories of many countries, such processes are far less
> studied than regime transitions forced by non-incumbent actors, such as coups
> or revolutions. We synthesize previous arguments and further specify how
> crises can incentivize leaders to change the regime from within due to two
> mechanisms. First, crises create windows of opportunity for leaders to pursue
> transitions they inherently prefer, for instance through self-coup. Second,
> crises sometimes allow opposition actors to mobilize and threaten the regime,
> forcing incumbents to liberalize. We leverage new data on timing and mode of
> regime change for more than 2000 regimes from about 200 countries, during the
> period 1789–2018. Employing different measurement strategies, estimators,
> control variables and other specification choices, we find fairly robust
> evidence that economic crises are related to transitions from within. However,
> when we distinguish between liberalizing and non-liberalizing guided
> transitions, we only find that economic crises systematically relate to the
> latter, suggesting that the window of opportunity mechanism may be especially
> pertinent in many contexts.

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today we focus on the intersection of environmental sustainability and the challenges faced by scientific communities. A significant shift towards integrating Indigenous knowledge in research is emerging, acknowledging the importance of maintaining ecological health and addressing the climate crisis. At the same time, there is increasing recognition of the systemic challenges researcher parents face, particularly concerning conference travel, and the broader impacts these issues have on scientific progress and inclusion.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Integrating Indigenous Knowledge in Environmental Research:** A new model emphasizes the importance of Indigenous environmental ethics for sustainable development and addresses the colonial legacies in scientific practices [349].
> - **Bird Flu Incident in Michigan:** The CDC reports a second case of bird flu in a dairy worker, underlining concerns but maintaining that the risk to the general public remains low [583].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Indigenous Rights in Research:** The increasing incorporation of Indigenous knowledge systems into environmental science and the ethical standards needed for reconciliation and sustainability [349]. Look for future policy and research shifts that emphasize these frameworks.
> - **Conference Travel for Researcher Parents:** A call for changes in how conference childcare costs are reimbursed highlights broader issues of inclusivity and support within the scientific community [169]. This could lead to policy changes that better support researcher parents.
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Food and Nutrition Insecurity in Los Angeles:** New research identifies distinct predictors for food insecurity and diet-related diseases, stressing the need for nuanced policy responses [1144].
> - **Drought Impact Linked to El Niño:** A study connecting recent droughts in the Panama Canal to El Niño rather than human-caused climate change indicates the complexity of environmental challenges [566].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Integrating Indigenous Knowledge in Environmental Research**
> 
> Recent developments in environmental science have highlighted the critical role of Indigenous knowledge systems in sustainable development. The new values-centered relational science model aims to reconcile the legacies of colonial research practices by raising ethical standards and promoting long-term relational accountability [349]. This model recognizes the integral role of Indigenous land stewardship in maintaining ecological health and addresses the challenges posed by incomplete datasets and the privileging of certain narratives over others.
> 
> ### **Challenges for Researcher Parents**
> 
> The plight of researcher parents is brought into focus by a recent call for changes in the reimbursement of childcare costs for conference travel [169]. This issue underscores broader systemic challenges within the scientific community, where inclusivity and support for work-life balance are often lacking. Addressing these challenges is essential for fostering a diverse and equitable research environment that can fully leverage the potential of all its members.
> 
> ### **Climate and Health Concerns**
> 
> - The CDC’s report of a second bird flu case in a dairy worker in Michigan has raised concerns, though the overall risk to the public remains low [583]. This incident highlights ongoing vulnerabilities and the need for vigilant biosecurity measures in agriculture.
> - Research linking the Panama Canal drought to El Niño emphasizes the importance of understanding natural climate cycles and their impact on global trade and environmental stability [566].
> 
> By addressing these interconnected issues, the scientific community can build a more inclusive and effective approach to tackling global challenges.
