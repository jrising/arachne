> ### **Indigenous Conservation Myths and Their Impact**
> The recent revelation that a prevalent statistic about biodiversity on Indigenous lands is inaccurate provokes a critical reevaluation of current conservation tactics. Indigenous lands have been heralded as biodiversity hotspots based on this misleading claim, potentially diverting resources and focus from areas where they could make more impactful differences. This finding necessitates thorough research into the actual conservation status and needs of these lands, ensuring that policies and efforts are evidence-based and effective.
> 
> Efforts should aim to integrate true Indigenous knowledge and practices into conservation strategies while debunking and correcting erroneous statistics. These changes could redefine the partnerships between Indigenous peoples and conservation organizations globally, leading to more nuanced and effective environmental policies.
> 
> Revisiting these statistics might also shift funding allocations, possibly impacting global conservation priorities. It’s essential to monitor upcoming policy discussions and research that aim to correct these myths and develop more accurate conservation metrics and strategies [12551].
