> Title: Lethal brands: Terrorist groups’ logos and violence
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Terrorist organizations are often described as brands. However, the most
> important visual representations of these brands – terrorist groups’ logos –
> have remained unexplored. In this article, we demonstrate that logos are
> signalling devices that provide vital cues on the propensity to use violence.
> To this end, we code and analyse 562 terrorist logos (2000–16). After
> providing a descriptive overview of the main colours and symbols used by
> terrorist groups worldwide, we rely on a zero-inflated negative binomial model
> to analyse the relationship between these organizations’ visual choices and
> their deadly activities. Our results show that the presence of violent,
> religious, and extremist symbols in terrorist organizations’ logos, as well as
> the use of black as the main colour, correlates with more frequent and
> deadlier attacks. These findings have important policy implications,
> demonstrating that logos serve as behavioural cues predicting the threat posed
> by terrorist groups not less effectively than their ideology. By highlighting
> the importance of visual artifacts like logos and their amenability to
> quantitative research, our article also provides a novel methodological
> contribution to international relations, helping bridge the gap between
> explanatory and critical security studies.

> Title: The military before the march: Civil-military grand bargains and the emergence of nonviolent resistance in autocracies
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article contributes to growing efforts to explain when nonviolent
> resistance campaigns emerge in autocratic regimes. Building from a novel
> framework for distinguishing civil-military relations in autocracies, it
> contends that regimes in which military and political leaders engage in a
> ‘grand bargain’ generate opportunity structures that are especially amenable
> to nonviolent resistance. Militaries in these regimes exhibit distinctive
> characteristics – they are corporate, cohesive institutions as opposed to
> fragmented in structure and also wield political influence in regime
> institutions. Consequently, these militaries are especially inclined to care
> about their societal reputations and to retain their institutional
> independence from the regime’s political leaders. These factors together can
> lessen expectations among activists that the military will repress protests
> and increase the odds of elite splits in the face of mass movements. They also
> render the military more receptive to nonviolent protest tactics. We
> operationalize the concept of grand bargains with indicators from three
> datasets on civil-military relations and autocratic regimes. We then test the
> argument quantitatively using data on the onset of nonviolent resistance
> campaigns, as well as events-level data on nonviolent resistance campaigns.
> The findings support claims that civil-military grand bargains make nonviolent
> resistance in autocracies more likely, contributing to scholarship on this
> vital topic.

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today presents an alarming picture of various global challenges and their significant impacts, from human displacement due to climate disasters to geopolitical tensions affecting campuses. An examination of recent studies reveals the profound and diverse consequences of these issues, necessitating a multidimensional approach to sustainability and well-being.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Climate Disasters Displacement in 2023**: Over 26 million people were forced to leave their homes due to floods, wildfires, droughts, and earthquakes [350]. The scale of displacement underscores the urgent need for robust climate action and disaster preparedness.
> - **Protests over Israel-Hamas War**: US universities are experiencing turmoil and divisions due to protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. This has led to heightened accusations of antisemitism and necessitated a high-stakes congressional hearing [524].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Global Climate Displacement**: The displacement of 26 million people in 2023 due to natural disasters [350] signals a growing crisis that demands international cooperation on climate resilience, infrastructure, and humanitarian aid.
> - **Campus Tensions in the US**: The ongoing protests over the Israel-Hamas war [524] could lead to prolonged conflicts on campuses, influence academic discourse, and affect the mental well-being of students and staff.
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Heat-Related Deaths in Phoenix**: Phoenix, experiencing unprecedented heat, is seeing a rise in heat-related deaths due to lack of planning and inadequate infrastructure to handle skyrocketing temperatures. This situation highlights the need for better urban planning and climate mitigation strategies [640].
> - **Spatiotemporal Analysis in Fisheries**: New research offers solutions to mitigate bycatch of Atlantic Cod in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence by analyzing spatiotemporal patterns, contributing to more sustainable fishing practices [402].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### Climate Displacement and Urban Heat Vulnerability
> 
> The recent data on climate-related displacement in 2023 [350] and the surge in heat-related deaths in Phoenix [640] paint a stark picture of the immediate impacts of climate change on human populations.
