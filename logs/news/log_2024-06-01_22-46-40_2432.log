> Title: The role of religion in shaping the values of nature
> Description: Environmental discourse frequently understands the values of nature as being
> instrumental, intrinsic, or relational and measured in biophysical,
> sociocultural, or monetary terms. Yet these specific values and value
> indicators are underpinned by worldviews, knowledge systems, and broad values
> that orient people towards nature in different ways and can be shared (or
> diverge) across spatio-temporal and social scales. The Intergovernmental
> Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) _Values Assessment_
> emphasized the need for decision-making to embrace a plural-values approach
> that encompasses these diverse meanings of value to catalyze outcomes based on
> sustainability-aligned broad values like care, unity, reciprocity, and
> justice. Navigating these diverse values also highlights the salience of
> religion and its complexity in real-world scenarios as a force that shapes how
> people conceive the values of nature. For example, proposed modes of plural-
> value deliberation to reform institutions and shift social norms toward
> justice and sustainability need to be able to bridge sacred–secular policy
> divides. This article evaluates how religion interacts with nature’s values by
> building upon reviews conducted for the IPBES _Values Assessment_ . We present
> different conceptualizations of religion and explore how these relate to
> various understandings of social-ecological change. Further, we delineate how
> religion interacts with values based on three interrelated forms of agency:
> personal, social, and more-than-human processes. Upon this foundation, we
> discuss how to better engage religion in environmental policy and research,
> considering four modes of mobilizing sustainability-aligned values: (1)
> enabling, (2) including, (3) reflecting, and (4) shifting values and two
> analytical axes regarding religion’s (1) social scale (individual versus
> collective) and (2) dynamic continuum (religion as stable versus changeable).
> Our assessment provides conceptual and practical tools to help consider
> religion in the processes and practices that shape, reinforce, or impede
> sustainability-aligned values for more inclusive and effective conservation
> decision-making.

> Title: Identification of tipping years and shifts in mesozooplankton community structure using multivariate analyses: a long-term study in southern North Sea
> Description: Abstract
> 
> Many previous studies on the changes in zooplankton communities considered
> only subsets of the total community. In this study, we investigated the
> temporal dynamics of the mesozooplankton community structure, considering all
> taxa (holo- and meroplankton) sampled over the last five decades at Helgoland
> Roads. We identified two tipping years. The first one occurred in 1983, which
> is consistent with previous studies conducted on copepods. The second shift,
> even more pronounced, took place in the mid-2000s. During the first shift,
> most taxa significantly increased in abundance and kept high densities until
> the end of the 1990s. Then, we observed in the mid-2000s a sharp decrease in
> community diversity and abundances of almost all taxa. One of the aims of the
> study was to test the robustness depending on the choice of taxa. To test
> this, we selected different subsets of the total zooplankton community, both
> randomly as well as based on functionality. We observed very similar trends
> over time for all groups, showing the complete community experienced the same
> changes. However, the timing of the tipping years depended on the organisms
> considered. These results highlight that the observed changes in the
> planktonic community are surprisingly robust and visible in most planktonic
> organisms.
