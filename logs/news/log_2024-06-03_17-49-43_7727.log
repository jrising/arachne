> Title: The role of accountability in the emergence of adaptive water governance
> Description: In this article we examine the role of accountability in the emergence of
> adaptive water governance drawing on a case study of shifts in governance on
> the Pongola River Floodplain in South Africa. The case study illustrates how
> lack of accountability by decision makers over the years inhibited the
> emergence of adaptive water governance on the floodplain. An important lesson
> to be drawn from the case study is that although adaptive governance can offer
> decision makers the capacity to confront change and uncertainty, this capacity
> is diminished when accountability is lacking or blurred because of conflicting
> interests. We demonstrate the need for accountable entities (such as

> Title: Major shift in the copepod functional community of the southern North Sea and potential environmental drivers
> Description: Abstract
> 
> Copepods form the bulk of secondary production in marine ecosystems and are a
> major resource for higher trophic levels. Copepods are highly sensitive to
> environmental changes as they are ectotherms with a short life span whose
> metabolism and development depend on abiotic conditions. In turn, changes in
> their functional structure (i.e. functional trait composition) can have
> impacts on ecosystems. We examined changes in the copepod functional community
> in the North Sea over the past five decades, using a trait-based approach. We
> observed a shift around 1986–1988: the copepod community was initially
> dominated by larger herbivores, with a long development time, diapause
> ability, and highest abundances in summer. This community changed abruptly
> after 1986–1988, to a dominance of smaller carnivore taxa, with shorter
> development times, less ability to enter diapause, and that display higher
> abundances in autumn. This rapid reorganization could be driven by higher
> water temperatures, lower dinoflagellate abundances, and low

> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Adaptive Water Governance:** Accountability plays a crucial role in the emergence of adaptive water governance, highlighted by a case study on the Pongola River Floodplain in South Africa, demonstrating the necessity for accountable entities to effectively manage environmental changes [774].
> - **Financial Toll of Alzheimer's:** New research reveals that individuals developing dementia often start falling behind on financial obligations years before diagnosis, indicating early warning signs that could potentially lead to earlier intervention strategies [912].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Papua New Guinea Landslide:** A devastating landslide in Papua New Guinea has buried 2,000 people, with blocked highways and unstable ground posing significant challenges for rescue efforts [470].
> - **Havana Syndrome Insights:** An article suggests that the injuries related to Havana Syndrome among U.S. diplomats may have explanations beyond pulsed microwaves or mass psychology, potentially reshaping investigative and medical responses [382].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> ### **Cancer Treatment Breakthrough**
> The recent development in cancer treatment using an antibody–drug conjugate to target CD45 is a remarkable step forward. This method not only efficiently eradicates leukaemic cells but also preserves vital haematopoiesis functions, representing a promising future for cancer therapies. The integration of transplanted stem cells engineered to be immune from the conjugate's effects ensures a balanced approach to treatment, minimizing collateral damage to the body's suppressive hematopoietic processes [217].
> 
> ### **Marine Fisheries Sustainability**
> The examination of tradeoffs in southeast U.S. marine fisheries management utilizes management strategy evaluation to balance ecological sustainability with economic interests. The involvement of various stakeholders and analytical models brings forth a comprehensive understanding of how different management strategies could impact both marine biodiversity and the local fishing industry, hence providing a robust foundation for future policymaking [455].
