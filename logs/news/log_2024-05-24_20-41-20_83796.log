> Title: Under God, indivisible? Religious salience and interstate territorial conflict
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> How and under what conditions do religious factors explain the militarization
> of interstate territorial disputes? We argue that inconclusive findings in
> previous studies stem from inadequate consideration of the interaction between
> challenger state religiosity and the domestic constituencies actually invested
> in religiously salient territorial claims. To address this gap, this article
> differentiates between secular regimes, which provide minimal support to their
> state’s dominant religion and religious regimes, which strongly support their
> dominant religion. It also considers narrowly salient coreligionist
> populations, which appeal almost exclusively to religious audiences, versus
> broadly salient contested sacred sites, which appeal to much broader
> constituencies. We argue that the interaction between these two factors
> produces very different patterns of interstate conflict behavior. Secular
> regimes avoid escalation over narrowly salient religious claims because they
> do not depend upon religious constituents for support. However, they lack the
> necessary religious legitimacy to manage outbidding challenges that frequently
> arise over more broadly salient claims. Religious regimes, by contrast, enjoy
> high domestic religious legitimacy, enabling more peaceful engagement with
> broadly salient religious claims. Yet their political dependence upon
> religious constituencies incentivizes conflict when disputes involve narrowly
> salient religious claims. We test these propositions utilizing original data
> on the religious salience of interstate territorial disputes in the post-Cold
> War era, from 1990 to 2010. Analyses, using both dichotomous and continuous
> measures of regime religiosity, confirm these inferences and contribute to
> highly nuanced understandings of how state-religion policy and religious
> salience interact to influence patterns of interstate violence.

> Title: Predicting important fishing grounds for the small-scale fishery, based on Automatic Identification System records, catches, and environmental data
> Description: Abstract
> 
> Effective and sustainable management of small-scale fisheries (SSF) is
> challenging. We describe a novel approach to identify important fishing
> grounds for SSF, by implementing a habitat modelling approach, using
> environmental predictors and Automatic Identification System (AIS)-B data
> coupled with logbook and First Sales Notes data, within the SE Bay of Biscay.
> Fishing activity patterns and catches of longliners and netters are used to
> determine the main environmental characteristics of the fishing grounds, and a
> habitat modelling approach is implemented to predict the zones that fulfil
> similar environmental characteristics across a larger geographical extent.
> Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were built for 24 fish species, and
> to identify other zones that fulfil similar characteristics and, thus, could
> be considered relevant for the species targeted by each gear type. Most of the
> models showed a good prediction capacity. The models included between one and
> four predictor variables. ‘Depth of mixing layer’ and ‘benthic rocky habitat’
> were the variables included more frequently for fish species captured by
> netter’s fleet. For longliners, the ‘seafloor slope’ and ‘benthic rocky
> habitat’ were the two most important variables. The predictive maps provide
> relevant information to assist in management and marine spatial planning.

> Title: Asymmetric burden-sharing and the restraining and deterrence effects of alliances
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Alliances are often presumed to serve the dual purpose of restraint and
> deterrence, though few existing studies examine their relationship and the
> connection with defense burden-sharing. This research employs a three-player
> game-theoretic model, which endogenizes the process of alliance formation and
> arms buildups, to demonstrate how intra-alliance burden-sharing allows the
> alliance to preserve the status quo. The results suggest that alliance burden-
> sharing may exert the deterrence and restraining effects, while at most one
> effect is observable at a time because the effects occur in separate parameter
> spaces. If a prospective ally’s cost of arms buildups is relatively low, a
> status-quo-oriented superpower may form an alliance even by shouldering a
> disproportionately heavy burden to dissuade the ally from overturning the
> status quo (the restraining effect). Conversely, if the cost is relatively
> high, the superpower may form an alliance to protect the ally from external
> threats (the deterrence effect). However, to prevent being exploited by this
> ally, the superpower provides only the units of armed forces that are
> sufficient to incentivize the ally to bolster its military capabilities to
> deter the threats. Their alliance entails power aggrandizement, but it does
> not provoke a non-signatory as the ally remains too weak to act unilaterally.

> Title: Linking smallholders’ livelihood resilience with their adaptation strategies to climate impacts: insights from the Tibetan Plateau
> Description: Adaptation and livelihood resilience are two key concepts for understanding
> the climate change process of smallholder farmers, but the relationships
> between them are not well understood. In this paper, with supporting data from
> household questionnaire surveys in four regions of the Tibetan Plateau (n =
> 1552), we aim to explore the relationships between smallholder farmers’
> climate adaptation and livelihood resilience. Based on existing studies, we
> developed a conceptual framework to integrate adaptation and livelihood
> resilience, and constructed a quantitative indicator system to measure
> livelihood resilience. The adaptation measures adopted by smallholders were
> classified into stepping out (SO) and stepping up (SU) strategies, and the
> livelihood resilience of smallholders with different adaptation strategies was
> calculated and compared using one-way analysis of variance. The multinomial
> logit (mlogit) model was used to examine the factors influencing the adoption
> of different adaptation strategies by smallholders. The results showed that
> the livelihood resilience of smallholders who adopted adaptation strategies
> was higher than that of those who did not, while the livelihood resilience of
> smallholders who adopted SO strategies was higher than that of those who
> adopted SU strategies. The mlogit model reported the factors that influence
> the adoption of different adaptation strategies by smallholders: household
> size, health conditions, number of cropland plots, agricultural equipment,
> number of livestock, and nonagricultural income. These indicators play
> different roles in the adoption of different adaptation strategies by
> smallholders. In particular, local government interventions (credit,
> cooperatives, training) are not only an important component of smallholders’
> livelihood resilience, but also important determinants of their livelihood
> strategies. Based on our findings, it is recommended that the government
> should promote smallholders’ adaptation and strengthen their livelihood
> resilience to climate change by expanding the coverage of credit,
> cooperatives, and training, diversifying the forms of cooperatives, enriching
> the content of training, and increasing the frequency of training.

> Title: Violence against civilians and public support for the state: The moderating role of governance and ideology
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> When state armed forces engage in violence against civilians during civil
> wars, why do some citizens continue to support the government? I argue that
> individuals’ support for the state in such contexts is shaped by the interplay
> between their perceptions of violence, governance and ideology. Drawing on
> research concerning motivated reasoning, I suggest that ideological similarity
> with and effective governance from the state can alleviate the negative effect
> of military violence against civilians on support for the state and,
> conversely, augment the positive effect of insurgent abuse on attitudes toward
> the government. Analysis of seven years of surveys fielded by the Latin
> American Public Opinion Project in Colombia between 2005 and 2011 suggests
> that individuals’ responses to victimization by the state’s armed forces
> depend on whether the individuals are ideologically aligned with the state.
> More specifically, among people who have an ideology similar to that of the
> president, military victimization has a less negative effect on support for
> the armed forces and for the national government. There is also mixed evidence
> that the quality of state governance, particularly the provision of security
> from crime, shapes the ways people respond to victimization. While existing
> studies primarily focus on the effects of either violence or governance on
> attitudes toward the state, these findings indicate that a more complete
> theory of why people support governments which engage in violence against
> civilians requires an understanding of not only violence but also of
> governance and ideology.

> 
> Researchers Solomon Hsiang and Marshall Burke dispute assertions by Adams et al. that climate-conflict research is biased due to a focus on conflict-prone locations. Hsiang and Burke argue that such a focus is justified and does not constitute a statistical error. They emphasize the importance of studying high-risk areas to better understand climate-induced conflict dynamics.

> This study explores the adaptation strategies and livelihood resilience of smallholder farmers on the Tibetan Plateau. It differentiates between "stepping out" (SO) and "stepping up" (SU) strategies and finds that SO strategies, which involve diversification outside traditional agriculture, provide higher resilience. The paper suggests expanding government interventions like credit, cooperatives, and training to enhance resilience.
