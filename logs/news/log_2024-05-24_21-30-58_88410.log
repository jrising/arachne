> Title: Nationalism and torture
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Why do states engage in violence against marginalized social groups? State
> violence is typically explained as a calculated response to dissent or as a
> means of preventing dissent. However, many instances of state violence against
> members of marginalized groups appear to be unconnected to dissent or anti-
> state mobilization. We examine this dimension of state violence and connect it
> to control of the government by nationalist political parties and the
> preferences of their voting bases. We argue that governments in which
> nationalist parties hold substantial influence are more likely to adopt
> policies that lead to abuse. Such policies include more aggressive policing of
> immigrants and ethnic minorities, and lax oversight and punishment of agencies
> responsible for policing. To test our argument, we examine the Ill-Treatment
> and Torture data, which record allegations of state violence and also
> information about the victim’s identity. We find that states with nationalist
> governments are more frequently accused of abuse against marginalized groups.
> Our results suggest that, rather than constraining abusive behavior through
> electoral accountability, the public in democratic countries sometimes prefer
> leaders who create a more abusive environment for marginalized groups.

> Wildfire activity in the US West coast has been unprecedented in the last

> Some caveats:
> 
>   * Again, we attribute all the change in PM2.5 in 2020 (relative to 5-yr avg) as due to wildfire. While this is probably not fully correct, the big spikes were definitely from wildfires. Further analysis will help clarify this. 
>   * PM2.5 from wildfire smoke might not have the same effect as overall PM2.5 (only some of which comes from wildfire). The science isn't clear on this yet. 
>   * We are in the midst of the COVID pandemic, and this has as-yet-unknown implications for our understanding of how air pollution affects health outcomes. Early evidence seems to suggest that poor air quality could worsen COVID-related outcomes, and if that's the case then our numbers above could be lower bounds. 
>   * Numbers above only look at elderly mortality and ER visits, and it's likely that other groups are very substantially affected (e.g. the very young, those with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions). Again, above numbers likely a dramatic lower bound on overall health consequences for that reason. 
>   * We don't know a ton about health responses at super high exposures. Does it tail off? Does it get way worse? You can find papers telling you both. Right now we're assuming response is linear, which is consistent with a lot of the literature. 
>   * We also don't have a full picture of "displacement" - i.e. if someone passes away due to air pollution exposure, maybe they were already extremely sick and so would have passed away in the near term anyway. Deryugina et al explore this to some degree by looking at 3-day (and longer) responses to a single day of pollution increase. They find effects of 1-day exposure over the next month to be about twice as big as the 3-day estimates we use, so again this could suggest our numbers are a lower bound. 
>   * Effects could also amplify over time, as its probably the case that exposure to 7 days in a row of terrible air is worse that exposure to 7 days spread out. Our numbers do not consider this, nor do we know of good estimates in the literature that would help with this. Please point them out if so!

> qualitative interviews with men and women social leaders who have worked in
> nine different conflict regions of Colombia to find that armed actors target

> Title: Leader age and international conflict: A regression discontinuity analysis
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> Does leader age matter for the likelihood of interstate conflict? Many studies
> in biology, psychology, and physiology have found that aggression tends to
> decline with age throughout the adult lifespan, particularly in males.
> Moreover, a number of major international conflicts have been attributed to
> young leaders, including the conquests of Alexander the Great and the
> ambitious military campaigns of Napoleon. However, the exact nature of the
> relationship between leader age and international conflict has been difficult
> to study because of the endogeneity problem. Leaders do not come to power
> randomly. Rather, many domestic and international factors influence who
> becomes the leader of a country, and some of these factors could correlate
> with the chances of interstate conflict. For instance, wary democratic publics
> might favor older leaders when future international conflict seems likely,
> inducing a relationship between older leaders and interstate conflict. This
> article overcomes such confounding by using a regression discontinuity design.
> Specifically, it looks at close elections of national leaders who had large
> differences in age. It finds that when older candidates barely defeated
> younger ones, countries were much less likely to engage in military conflict.
> Its sample is also fairly representative of democracies more broadly, meaning
> that the findings likely hold true for cases outside the sample. The results
> demonstrate the important role that individuals play in shaping world
> politics. They also illustrate the value of design-based inference for
> learning about important questions in the study of international relations and
> peace science.

> Title: Bias and balance in civil war mediation
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> This article identifies a mechanism through which multiparty mediation –
> mediation with multiple active third parties – has positive effects on civil
> war resolution. Balanced mediation efforts – those providing third parties
> biased toward both sides of the dispute – have unique advantages in generating
> peaceful outcomes. In particular, balanced efforts alleviate the commitment
> concerns faced by both the rebel group and the government, improving the
> prospects for peace. In this article, I develop a measure, Mediation balance,
> which aggregates the mediators’ biases when multiple third parties are
> present. I also consider, both theoretically and empirically, how the number
> of mediators interacts with mediation balance to shape outcomes. I test my
> theory on civil war mediation attempts between 1989 and 2005, finding that
> balanced mediation efforts improve the probability of reaching an agreement.
> Furthermore, the strength of this effect is influenced by the number of
> mediators involved. Mediation balance also influences the probability the
> agreement halts the violence, albeit in unexpected ways.

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today's memo explores the intersection between violence, mental health, and emerging technological and scientific advancements. Understanding how state violence and social media influence mental health provides deeper insight into current societal challenges, while fresh strides in male contraception and insights into climate impacts on agriculture highlight promising technological and scientific advancements.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Nationalism and Torture:**
>   - A new study argues that states with nationalist governments are more frequently accused of abuse against marginalized groups, focusing on how nationalist policies foster an environment conducive to abuse [142].
> - **Social-Media Influence on Teen Mental Health:**
>   - Research indicates that the impact of social media on teen mental health is complex and extends beyond simple cause-and-effect relationships. This highlights the need for nuanced approaches to addressing mental health in the digital age [532].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Wildfire Health Impacts:**
>   - Recent analysis of PM2.5 levels during California wildfires indicates severe health impacts, particularly for the elderly. This underscores the broader health implications of climate change and the need for improved air quality monitoring and response systems [237].
> - **Emerging Male Contraception:**
>   - Scientists have identified a nonhormonal target for male contraception using a DNA-encoded chemical library, which could revolutionize family planning and gender dynamics in reproductive health [445].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Effect of Exercise on Heart Health:**
>   - Studies are investigating why elite athletes are prone to abnormal heart rhythms, which could lead to better understanding and prevention of such conditions in the general population [25].
> - **Mars Rover Mission:**
>   - An upcoming Mars rover mission will utilize a pioneering nuclear power source, marking a significant step forward in space exploration and the potential for long-term missions on other planets [531].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> *State Violence and Nationalism*
> 
> Recent research connects state violence against marginalized groups to the political influence of nationalist parties. This violence often appears unconnected to direct dissent but is driven by aggressive policies and lax oversight fueled by nationalist ideologies. These findings suggest a troubling link between public preference for nationalist leaders and an increase in state-sanctioned abuse [142].
> 
> *Social Media and Teen Mental Health*
> 
> Exploring the impact of social media on teen mental health reveals a web of factors influencing well-being beyond direct cause and effect. This complexity calls for comprehensive strategies to address mental health issues, particularly in a digital landscape where teens are heavily engaged [532].
> 
> *Climate Change and Public Health*
> 
> Wildfires in California have led to unprecedented increases in PM2.5 levels, contributing to significant health consequences, especially among the elderly. The interplay between climate change and health is starkly evident here, necessitating robust measures to mitigate and adapt to these impacts [237].
