> Title: The election of former rebel women
> Description: Journal of Peace Research, Ahead of Print.  
> After conflict, many ex-combatant men experience the spoils of war as their
> rebel groups transition into political parties and elect former members to
> party seats. However, it is unclear whether these opportunities are reserved
> only for male ex-combatants. This article considers when and why voters might
> support former rebel women running for political office. It argues that the
> election of these women will depend on their roles within rebel groups, as
> well as their use of violence during conflict. The article presents a novel
> dataset on the election of former rebel women to rebel parties from 1970 to
> 2020. The results indicate that women’s roles as combatants and leaders in
> rebel groups are associated with higher levels of election for rebel women. In
> contrast, rebel women’s ties to violent tactics such as terrorism and sexual
> violence during war are associated with a lower level of election for rebel
> women after conflict. The interactions between rebel women’s roles and ties to
> violence are tested; the results suggested that, regardless of elite roles,
> rebel women’s electoral chances are hurt by extreme forms of violence,
> demonstrating the salience of the negative stigmas attached to violent women.
> The findings also demonstrate that while many former rebel women are
> marginalized after war, a select few experience political gains.

> Title: Synchronized multidecadal trends and regime shifts in North Atlantic plankton populations
> Description: Abstract
> 
> Recent changes in oceanic plankton are being reported at unprecedented rates.
> Most changes are related to environmental factors, and many were identified as
> driven by climate, either through natural cycles or by anthropogenic effects.
> However, the separation of both effects is difficult because of the short
> length of most observational series. Moreover, some changes are related to
> trends and cycles, while others were perceived as system shifts, often
> synchronized over large spatial scales. Here, studies on observational series
> of plankton, with the focus in the North Atlantic, are reviewed. Two main
> periods of shifts in plankton assemblages were identified: one in the late
> 1980s and a more recent one at the beginning of the new millennium. While the
> origin and extent of most shifts varied locally, their synchronization seems
> to confirm the response of plankton to changes in warming and in large-scale
> climatic factors. Changes in species abundance and distribution patterns were
> generally related to hydrographic factors, but also to non-linear effects of
> warming, the latter particularly affecting species in regions near the limits
> of their thermal niches. Indeed, most of the changes were attributed to trade-
> offs between different biological strategies. Taken together, the reviewed
> case studies indicate a lagged biological response to variations in the local
> environment driven by large-scale climate forcing. The challenges for
> interpreting future shifts include considering local changes within a larger
> geographical area, variations in species life traits, and potential top-down
> effects of plankton predators.

> # Daily Memo
> ## **Narrative Overview**
> 
> Today’s memo delves into key advancements in sustainable fisheries management and highlights emerging trends in related ecological and socio-political areas. From the development of standards in aquaponics to socioecological impacts in Chile and innovative flood risk mitigation strategies, these stories collectively underscore the dynamic intersection of environmental science, community wellbeing, and policy evolution.
> 
> ## **Key Highlights**
> 
> ### **Top News Stories**
> - **Advances in Aquaponics Metrics:** New standards and metrics for physical, operational, and performance aspects of aquaponics have been developed to better balance the water quality needs of both plants and fish [1085].
> - **Socioecological Impacts in Northern Chile:** The interrelation of the brown seaweeds fishery and copper mining production demonstrates significant socioecological impacts driven by international market demands for alginates and metal [1022].
> 
> ### **Keep an Eye On**
> - **Community-Based Flood Risk Mitigation:** A new approach for flood risk planning highlights how community-based risk trajectories enhance transparency and equity in urban river areas, offering a promising shift towards more inclusive environmental management models [1270].
> - **Plankton Population Shifts:** Observational studies of North Atlantic plankton populations reveal synchronized multidecadal trends and regime shifts likely driven by climate change, which presents ongoing challenges for marine ecosystem management [422].
> 
> ### **Important Alerts**
> - **Marine Protected Areas Impact on Lobster Fisheries:** A review suggests Marine Protected Areas could significantly impact lobster population sizes and structures, influencing fisheries management practices [449].
> - **Essential Fish Habitats in the Gulf of Guinea:** Critical habitats for demersal fish in the Gulf of Guinea have been identified, emphasizing the need for space-based management measures to maintain sustainable fishing practices [1030].
> 
> ## **In-Depth Analysis**
> 
> ### **Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture Management**
> 
> The development of new metrics for aquaponics systems is a crucial step toward optimizing the balance between fish and plant water quality needs, which could lead to enhanced productivity and sustainability in these integrated systems [1085]. 
> 
> Moreover, the complex socioecological impacts of the brown seaweeds fishery in Northern Chile highlight the interconnectedness of local economies and global market demands. The sustainable management of these resources is essential, as demonstrated by the direct coupling of seaweed landing expansions and international demand for alginates [1022].
> 
> Additionally, the identification of essential fish habitats in the Gulf of Guinea and the review of Marine Protected Areas impact on lobsters underscore the importance of spatial management measures in maintaining fish populations and supporting sustainable fisheries [1030][449].
> 
> The shift towards community-based flood risk trajectories further aligns with the broader theme of integrating socio-ecological considerations into environmental management. This approach promotes transparency and equity, particularly in urban settings, thus encouraging more resilient and inclusive communities in the face of climate change-induced flooding events [1270].
> 
> By recognizing these interconnected dimensions of aquaculture, fisheries, and community-based environmental planning, today's insights collectively highlight innovative strides towards achieving global sustainability and improved resource management.
