**assistant**:
> The standard file ending for a pickle file in Python is `.pkl`.
**user**:
> Is there a `with` structure for pickled files?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use the `with` statement to open and handle pickled files in Python. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after you're done using it, even if an exception is raised during the process.
> 
> Here's an example of how you can use the `with` statement with pickled files:
> 
> ```python
> import pickle
> 
> # Creating a pickled object
> data = [1, 2, 3]
> 
> # Saving the pickled object to a file
> file_path = 'data.pkl'
> with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
>     pickle.dump(data, file)
> 
> # Loading the pickled object from the file
> with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
>     loaded_data = pickle.load(file)
> 
> # Now you can work with the loaded data
> print(loaded_data)
> ```
> 
> In the above example, the `with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:` statement is used to create a pickled file for writing, and `with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:` is used to open the pickled file for reading. The pickled data is then dumped or loaded using `pickle.dump()` and `pickle.load()` respectively. The `with` statement takes care of closing the file automatically once the block is exited, ensuring proper handling of the file.
