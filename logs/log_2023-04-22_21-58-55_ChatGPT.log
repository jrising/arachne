> 
> I denotes the observable or dependent; and can be used for the second person pronoun, genitive case, future tense, subjunctive verbs, and to denote a plural mass noun. As a root, it generally means "describe".
> 
> N denotes the unknown or static; and can be used for the third person pronoun, accusative case, past tense, imperative verbs, and to denote a plural count noun. As a root, it generally means "be".

> Based on the information you provided, here's a summary of your language's structure:
> 
> 1. The language uses three basic letters (N, I, and O) and nine derived letters (B, Q, A, P, U, L, R, J, M) to form words.
> 2. Words are built around roots, which convey the general concept.
> 3. The meaning of words is refined by adding letters or groups of letters.
> 4. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs have distinct constructions.
> 5. Opposites are constructed using a root for the relevant dimension and adding O, N, or I for different extremes.

> Now, feel free to ask any questions you may have about this language!
**user**:
> Can you propose a sequence of three-way decisions along sequentially more-specific dimensions, to go from sensation (NI) to specific colors. This should be succinct but disambiguate. I imagine that this would by specifying inward-vs.-outward sensation (to specify outward), to different senses to specify vision, and end with a structure like HSV to specify colors.
**assistant**:
> Sure! We can create a sequence of three-way decisions to move from sensation (NI) to specific colors. Here's a proposed structure:
> 
> 1. Inward vs. Outward Sensation:
>    - Inward Sensation: NIO (focusing on internal sensations)
>    - Outward Sensation: NOO (focusing on external sensations, including vision)
>    - Balance between Inward and Outward: NIN (a mix of both internal and external sensations)
> 
> 2. Types of Outward Sensations:
>    - Vision: NOOI (outward sensation related to seeing)
>    - Auditory: NOON (outward sensation related to hearing)
>    - Tactile: NOIN (outward sensation related to touch)
> 
> 3. Colors in Vision (based on the HSV model):
>    - Hue:
>       - NOOIO (Hue, ranging from red to violet)
>       - NOOIN (Hue, the line between two colors, such as red-orange or blue-green)
>       - NOOON (Hue, representing neutral colors, such as grayscale)
>    - Saturation:
>       - NOOOI (Saturation, vivid and bright colors)
>       - NOOON (Saturation, moderate or balanced colors)
>       - NOOOO (Saturation, muted or desaturated colors)
>    - Value/Brightness:
>       - NOOOO (Value, dark colors or low brightness)
>       - NOOIO (Value, balanced brightness)
>       - NOOII (Value, light colors or high brightness)
> 
> By combining these elements, we can describe specific colors in your language. For example, a vivid red could be described as NOOI NOOIO NOOOI, which refers to vision (NOOI), red hue (NOOIO), and high saturation (NOOOI).
**user**:
> Should form vs. color be a distinct dimension?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it makes sense to have form and color as distinct dimensions in your language. Form refers to the shape or structure of an object, while color is an attribute that helps to describe its appearance. By having separate dimensions for form and color, your language will be better suited to express detailed descriptions of objects and sensations.
> 
> To incorporate this distinction in your language, you can create separate three-way decisions for form and color:
> 
> 1. Types of Outward Sensations (updated):
>    - Vision: NOOI (outward sensation related to seeing)
>    - Auditory: NOON (outward sensation related to hearing)
>    - Tactile: NOIN (outward sensation related to touch)
> 
> 2. Visual Dimensions:
>    - Form: NOOIA (shape or structure)
>    - Color: NOOIB (hue, saturation, and brightness)
>    - Form-Color Balance: NOOIC (a combination of form and color)
> 
> 3. Form Dimensions:
>    - Simple Forms: NOOIAO (basic shapes like circles, squares, triangles)
>    - Complex Forms: NOOIAN (intricate structures or patterns)
>    - Abstract Forms: NOOIAI (forms that don't have a clear or definitive shape)
> 
> 4. Color Dimensions (HSV model, as explained in the previous answer)
> 
> By differentiating form and color as distinct dimensions, your language can more accurately describe a variety of visual sensations. For example, to describe a vivid red circle, you could combine the terms: NOOI NOOIAO NOOIB NOOIO NOOOI (vision, simple form, color, red hue, high saturation).
**user**:
> Where would smell and taste fall in this categorization? I am concerned about having an incomplete sequence of dimensions to have a word everything.
**assistant**:
> You are right; to create a comprehensive system that accounts for all senses, you should include smell and taste in your categorization. To accommodate these senses, we can expand the second step in the sequence of dimensions, focusing on the Types of Outward Sensations.
> 
> 1. Types of Outward Sensations (expanded):
>    - Vision: NOOI (outward sensation related to seeing)
>    - Auditory: NOON (outward sensation related to hearing)
>    - Tactile: NOIN (outward sensation related to touch)
>    - Olfactory: NOIA (outward sensation related to smell)
>    - Gustatory: NOIB (outward sensation related to taste)
> 
> With this expanded set of Types of Outward Sensations, you now have a more complete sequence of dimensions to describe all five senses.
> 
> For smell (olfactory) and taste (gustatory), you can further create three-way decisions to describe various characteristics of these sensations, such as intensity, type, and pleasantness.
> 
> For example, for olfactory sensations:
> 
> 1. Smell Intensity:
>    - NOIAO (strong smell)
>    - NOIAN (moderate smell)
>    - NOIAI (mild smell)
> 
> 2. Smell Type:
>    - NOIAAO (sweet smell)
>    - NOIAAN (sour smell)
>    - NOIAAI (other smell types)
> 
> 3. Smell Pleasantness:
>    - NOIAOA (pleasant smell)
>    - NOIAON (unpleasant smell)
>    - NOIAOI (neutral smell)
> 
> Similarly, you can create a structure for gustatory sensations, focusing on taste intensity, taste type (sweet, salty, bitter, etc.), and taste pleasantness. This way, you can form words for various taste sensations in your language.
**user**:
> Is there a better description of standard and non-standard colors for this purpose than HSV?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is an alternative color model that can be more intuitive and easier to understand for this purpose: the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) model. The HSL model is often considered more perceptually relevant, as it separates the chromatic information (hue and saturation) from the luminance (lightness). This model might be better suited for describing standard and non-standard colors in your language.
> 
> Here's a breakdown of the HSL model for your language:
> 
> 1. Hue (color type):
>    - NOOIO (red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta)
>    - NOOIN (transitions between colors, such as red-orange, blue-green)
>    - NOOON (achromatic colors, like grays and black-and-white)
> 
> 2. Saturation (color intensity):
>    - NOOOI (highly saturated, vivid colors)
>    - NOOON (moderate saturation, somewhat desaturated colors)
>    - NOOOO (low saturation, pale or almost gray colors)
> 
> 3. Lightness (brightness):
>    - NOOOO (dark colors, low lightness)
>    - NOOIO (medium lightness, neither dark nor bright)
>    - NOOII (light colors, high lightness)
> 
> This HSL model should work better for describing standard and non-standard colors in your language. For example, to describe a vivid red with medium lightness, you would combine the terms: NOOI NOOIB NOOIO NOOOI NOOIO (vision, color, red hue, high saturation, medium lightness).
