For this option, you need to contact the faculty directly and see if they will have funding for new students; 2) the university and college have some competitive fellowships for strong candidates; 3) some students can even apply for external funding and bring the funding to the university. For your case, at this stage, I would suggest that you review the faculty website and identify ones who you want to work with, and contact them directly.

If you are still interested in studying with us, you are welcome to transfer your application to our Environmental Economics Masters program.
