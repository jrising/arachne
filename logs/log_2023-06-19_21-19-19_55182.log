**user**:
> I want to improve the UX of a chat page which by default scrolls down to the bottom as messages come in, but if you scroll up (or generally, didn't start at the bottom when the message arrived), it doesn't scroll down. How can I do this in javascript?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by adding a simple JavaScript function that checks the scroll position of the chat container before deciding to auto-scroll to the bottom when a new message comes in. Here's a step-by-step guide:
> 
> 1. Give your chat container a unique ID.
> 
> ```html
> <div id="chatContainer">
>   <!-- Your chat messages will be here -->
> </div>
> ```
> 
> 2. Create a JavaScript function to auto-scroll only if the user is already at the bottom.
> 
> ```javascript
> function autoScrollIfAtBottom() {
>   const chatContainer = document.getElementById('chatContainer');
>   const isAtBottom = (chatContainer.scrollHeight - chatContainer.offsetHeight) - chatContainer.scrollTop < 1;
> 
>   if (isAtBottom) {
>     chatContainer.scrollTop = chatContainer.scrollHeight;
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> 3. Call the `autoScrollIfAtBottom()` function whenever a new message is received.
> 
> ```javascript
> // Receive new message and add it to the chat (assuming you have a `addMessage` function that adds messages to the chat container)
> addMessage(newMessage);
> 
> // Call autoScrollIfAtBottom() to check and scroll down if needed
> autoScrollIfAtBottom();
> ```
> 
> This script will now only scroll the chat container to the bottom when a new message is received if the user is already at the bottom. Otherwise, the scroll position will be unchanged, allowing them to read previous messages without being interrupted.
**user**:
> But won't you no longer be at the bottom, as soon as addMessage is called, before autoScrollIfAtBottom?
**assistant**:
> Good point! You're correct that if `addMessage` is called before `autoScrollIfAtBottom()`, the user's scroll position will have changed. To avoid this issue, you can refactor the code to make sure that you only call `autoScrollIfAtBottom()` after the new message has been added to the chat container and after any other user-initiated scrolling has completed. Here's one way to achieve that:
> 
> ```javascript
> function addMessageAndScroll(message) {
>   const chatContainer = document.getElementById('chatContainer');
> 
>   // Save the current scroll position and height
>   const isAtBottom = (chatContainer.scrollHeight - chatContainer.offsetHeight) - chatContainer.scrollTop < 1;
>   const previousScrollHeight = chatContainer.scrollHeight;
> 
>   // Add the new message to the chat
>   addMessage(message);
> 
>   // Only scroll if at bottom or user-initiated scrolling has completed
>   if (isAtBottom || chatContainer.scrollHeight === previousScrollHeight) {
>     chatContainer.scrollTop = chatContainer.scrollHeight;
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> To use this function, simply replace the `addMessage` call with:
> 
> ```javascript
> addMessageAndScroll(newMessage);
> ```
> 
> This new function saves the chat container's scroll position and height before adding the new message and then only scrolls down if the user is at the bottom or they haven't initiated any new scroll after the message was added.
