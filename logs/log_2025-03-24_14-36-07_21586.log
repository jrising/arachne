> How can I organize these sensibly?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! These functional groups are organized by size and category. Here's a clearer way to organize them:
> 
> ### Large Fish (â‰¥90 cm)
> - Bathydemersals
> - Bathypelagics
> - Benthopelagics
> - Demersals
> - Flatfishes
> - Pelagics
> - Rays
> - Reef-associated fish
> - Sharks
> 
> ### Medium Fish (30 - 89 cm)
> - Bathydemersals
> - Bathypelagics
> - Benthopelagics
> - Demersals
> - Pelagics
> - Reef-associated fish
> 
> ### Small Fish (<30 cm)
> - Bathydemersals
> - Bathypelagics
> - Benthopelagics
> - Demersals
> - Pelagics
> - Reef-associated fish
> 
> ### Small to Medium Fish (<90 cm)
> - Flatfishes
> - Rays
> - Sharks
> 
> This organization provides a clear hierarchy based first on size (Large, Medium, Small, and Small to Medium) and then by specific functional group categories. It should make it easier for you to analyze or present the data in a structured way. If you have any further questions or need additional organization based on any other characteristics, feel free to ask!
