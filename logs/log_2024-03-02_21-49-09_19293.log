**user**:
> Are there betters terms for "longitudinal"  and "latitudinal", refering to the E/W and N/S directions?
**assistant**:
> While "longitudinal" and "latitudinal" are standard terms used in geography and are widely understood, alternative terminology could include "meridional" for "latitudinal" (N/S oriented), and "zonal" for "longitudinal" (E/W oriented). It's important to note though that these are typically used in meteorological and oceanographic contexts and may not be understood as easily outside of these professional fields.
