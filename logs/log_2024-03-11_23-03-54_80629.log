> Dear Professor James Rising,
> 
> I hope this email finds you well. My name is Agnes Baiden, and I am one of the new graduate students admitted to the MSc. Environmental Science and Management program for the upcoming semester. I am writing to express my sincere interest in securing a graduate assistantship position within the realm of Environmental Science and Management.
> 
> With a strong passion for environmental advocacy and community engagement, and experiences gained during my tenure at the Ghana  Environmental Protection Agency, I have cultivated a strong foundation in areas such as climate change, plastic pollution and natural capital. These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills in research, which I am keen to apply to further academic pursuits.
> 
> I am eager to contribute my expertise and passion to ongoing research initiatives within the Climate Science Track. I am particularly interested in exploring opportunities to collaborate on research projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.  
> 
> I am open to various roles within the Graduate Student Assistantship framework, including Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, or any administrative assignment where my skills and background can be effectively utilized. I believe that a graduate assistantship would not only provide valuable financial support but also offer me the opportunity to gain practical experience, collaborate with faculty members and fellow students, and further develop my skills and knowledge in the field. I am adaptable, diligent, and committed to academic excellence, and I am confident that I can make a meaningful contribution to the University of Delaware community. 
> 
> I have attached my CV for your review, which provides further details about my academic and professional background. Additionally, I am more than willing to provide any additional information or materials that may be required as part of the application process.
