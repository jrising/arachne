> Yes, there are color-blind safe palettes for qualitative data that contain ten colors. Here are two examples:
> 
> 1. Tableau's "Color Blind Palette": 
> Tableau is a data visualization software company that offers a pre-built color palette for individuals with color vision deficiencies. The Tableau Color Blind Palette includes ten colors that are distinguishable by people with various types of color blindness. Here are the ten colors in this palette: 
> 
> - Blue
> - Orange
> - Green
> - Red
> - Purple
> - Yellow
> - Light blue
> - Pink
> - Gray
> - Brown
> 
> 2. ColorBrewer's "Qualitative Palette": 
> ColorBrewer is a web tool that helps users select appropriate color schemes for their data visualization needs. The ColorBrewer Qualitative Palette provides ten colors that are distinguishable by people with color vision deficiencies. Here are the ten colors in this palette:
> 
> - Dark blue
> - Light blue
> - Dark green
> - Light green
> - Dark red
> - Light red
> - Dark purple
> - Light purple
> - Brown
> - Gray
> 
> Keep in mind that even with color-blind safe palettes, it's still important to add labels and patterns to your visualization to ensure that the information is accessible to all viewers.
**user**:
> Can you provide code for me to use a color blind palette with 11 entries?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's an example code snippet in Python using the "Color Blind Palette" from Tableau with 11 entries:
> 
> ```python
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> import matplotlib.colors as colors
> 
> # Define the colorblind-safe Tableau palette with 11 colors
> cb_palette = ['#4E79A7', '#F28E2B', '#E15759', '#76B7B2', '#59A14F',
>               '#EDC948', '#B07AA1', '#FF9DA7', '#9C755F', '#BAB0AC', '#B7999C']
> 
> # Create a sample plot using the palette
> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
> for i in range(11):
>     ax.plot([i, i+1], [0, 1], color=cb_palette[i], linewidth=5, label=f'Color {i+1}')
> ax.legend()
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> In this example, we're using Matplotlib to create a simple plot with 11 lines, each drawn in a different color from the Tableau Color Blind Palette. The `cb_palette` variable stores the 11 colors as hex codes, and we loop through each color to draw a line on the plot.
> 
> You can modify this code to suit your own needs, such as changing the plot type, adjusting the line thickness, or using the palette for other data visualization purposes.
