> 
> Climate change also affects fisheries and marine environments, by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean such as temperatures, pH, oxygen content, and salinity (World Bank 2019), negatively impacting fish stock movements and fish habitats. Warming oceans can have adverse effects such as restructuring of species composition (Fodrie et al. 2010, Beaugrand et al 2015, Wernberg et al. 2016, Flanagan et al. 2019); changes in species phenology (Edwards and Richardson 2004, Mills et al. 2013, Staudinger et al. 2019); changes in geographic species distributions (Pinsky et al. 2013, Poloczanska et al. 2013);  accessibility of target species to fisherman (Young et al. 2018, Pinsky and Fogarty 2012, Hughes et al. 2015); changes in stock productivity (Hare and Able 2007, Bell et al. 2014, Pershing et al. 2015, Le Bris et al. 2018); possible global loss of biomass in the oceans, especially at the middle and lower latitudes (Lotze et al. 2019); potential decline in landings by the 21st century on many of the most valuable fishing grounds (Cheung et al. 2010, Free et al. 2019) and importantly the implications for people who depend on fish for food and income, and thus the contribution of fisheries to the global economy (Sumaila et al 2011 and Barange 2014).

**assistant**:
> Climate change is impacting fisheries and marine ecosystems by altering oceanic parameters like temperature, pH, oxygen levels, and salinity (World Bank 2019), which in turn affect fish stock movements and habitats. These changes can lead to restructuring of species composition (Fodrie et al. 2010, Beaugrand et al 2015), alterations in species phenology (Edwards and Richardson 2004), shifts in geographic distributions (Pinsky et al. 2013, Poloczanska et al. 2013), and changes in stock productivity (Hare and Able 2007, Bell et al. 2014). Furthermore, such shifts can limit the accessibility of target species to fisherman (Young et al. 2018), potentially cause a global loss of marine biomass (Lotze et al. 2019), and predict a decline in landings on major fishing grounds by the 21st century (Free et al. 2019). These developments have implications for those relying on fish for sustenance and income, affecting the global economy (Sumaila et al 2011 and Barange 2014).
