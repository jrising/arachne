> How can I show mathematically, that the Kaya identity an be re-written as a sum of the growth terms of each of its components?
**assistant**:
> The Kaya identity is often expressed as:
> 
> CO2 = P * (G / P) * (E / G) * (CO2 / E),
> 
> where:
> - P is the world population,
> - G is world GDP (economic output),
> - E is the worldâ€™s total primary energy consumption.
> - CO2 is the world's total CO2 emissions.
> 
> This identity decomposes CO2 emissions into four factors: population, per-capita GDP, energy intensity of GDP, and carbon intensity of energy.
> 
> When we talk about growth terms of these components, it's common to express these changes in the context of logarithmic derivatives. 
> 
> The total derivative of a product of terms is given, in logarithmic form, by the sum of the derivatives. Hence we have:

> Equivalently, the growth rate of CO2 emissions is equal to the sum of the growth rates of the four terms on the right.
> 
> This equation states mathematically that the relative growth rate of total emissions is the sum of the relative growth rates of: 
> 1. Population,
> 2. GDP per person,
> 3. Energy used per unit of GDP,
> 4. CO2 emissions per unit of energy.
> 
> Each of these terms is the logarithmic derivative (i.e., the percentage change or relative growth rate) of one component of the Kaya identity. Expressing the equation this way allows the components of emission growth to be summed up, as you asked.
