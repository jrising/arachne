**assistant**:
> The function groups that primarily live on the ocean floor are:
> 
> 1. **Flatfishes** - They are typically bottom-dwellers, often camouflaging themselves with the ocean floor.
> 2. **Demersals** - These fish live close to the seabed and include many species that actively feed on the bottom.
> 3. **Bathydemersals** - Similar to demersal fish, but found in the deeper parts of the ocean, living near or on the sea floor.
> 4. **Rays** - Many types of rays are benthic, living on the ocean floor.
> 5. **Reef Associated Fish** - While not strictly "ocean floor" dwellers, they are often associated with the structure and community around reefs, including the substrate.
> 
> Meanwhile, benthopelagics are somewhat intermediate, living and feeding near the bottom but not exclusively on it. Bathypelagics and pelagics inhabit the open ocean waters, while sharks can vary widely, inhabiting both pelagic zones and near the bottom, depending on the species.
