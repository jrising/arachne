> I am trying to get a documentation website up, using Julia's Documenter.jl. The current docs are in LaTeX though, so I think I need to use pandoc to convert them to markdown. But when I do this with default settings, the resulting markdown is rendered with a lot of problems. Here is Julia's Markdown guide:
> ===
> The Julia Language logo
> Search docs

> v1.10.4
> Edit on GitHub
> Markdown
> This section describes Julia's markdown syntax, which is enabled by the Markdown standard library. The following Markdown elements are supported:
> 
> Inline elements
> Here "inline" refers to elements that can be found within blocks of text, i.e. paragraphs. These include the following elements.
> 
> Bold
> Surround words with two asterisks, **, to display the enclosed text in boldface.
> 
> A paragraph containing a **bold** word.
> 
> Italics
> Surround words with one asterisk, *, to display the enclosed text in italics.
> 
> A paragraph containing an *italicized* word.
> 
> Literals
> Surround text that should be displayed exactly as written with single backticks, ` .
> 
> A paragraph containing a `literal` word.
> 
> Literals should be used when writing text that refers to names of variables, functions, or other parts of a Julia program.
> 
> Tip
> To include a backtick character within literal text use three backticks rather than one to enclose the text.
> 
> A paragraph containing ``` `backtick` characters ```.
> 
> By extension any odd number of backticks may be used to enclose a lesser number of backticks.
> 
> LaTeX
> L 
> A
>  T 
> E
> ​
>  X
> Surround text that should be displayed as mathematics using 
> LaTeX
> L 
> A
>  T 
> E
> ​
>  X syntax with double backticks, `` .
> 
> A paragraph containing some ``\LaTeX`` markup.
> 
> Tip
> As with literals in the previous section, if literal backticks need to be written within double backticks use an even number greater than two. Note that if a single literal backtick needs to be included within 
> LaTeX
> L 
> A
>  T 
> E
> ​
>  X markup then two enclosing backticks is sufficient.
> 
> Note
> The \ character should be escaped appropriately if the text is embedded in a Julia source code, for example, "``\\LaTeX`` syntax in a docstring.", since it is interpreted as a string literal. Alternatively, in order to avoid escaping, it is possible to use the raw string macro together with the @doc macro:
> 
> @doc raw"``\LaTeX`` syntax in a docstring." functionname
> 
> Links
> Links to either external or internal targets can be written using the following syntax, where the text enclosed in square brackets, [ ], is the name of the link and the text enclosed in parentheses, ( ), is the URL.
> 
> A paragraph containing a link to [Julia](http://www.julialang.org).
> 
> It's also possible to add cross-references to other documented functions/methods/variables within the Julia documentation itself. For example:
> 
> """
>     tryparse(type, str; base)
> 
> Like [`parse`](@ref), but returns either a value of the requested type,
> or [`nothing`](@ref) if the string does not contain a valid number.
> """
> 
> This will create a link in the generated docs to the parse documentation (which has more information about what this function actually does), and to the nothing documentation. It's good to include cross references to mutating/non-mutating versions of a function, or to highlight a difference between two similar-seeming functions.
> 
> Note
> The above cross referencing is not a Markdown feature, and relies on Documenter.jl, which is used to build base Julia's documentation.
> 
> Footnote references
> Named and numbered footnote references can be written using the following syntax. A footnote name must be a single alphanumeric word containing no punctuation.
> 
> A paragraph containing a numbered footnote [^1] and a named one [^named].
> 
> Note
> The text associated with a footnote can be written anywhere within the same page as the footnote reference. The syntax used to define the footnote text is discussed in the Footnotes section below.
> 
> Toplevel elements
> The following elements can be written either at the "toplevel" of a document or within another "toplevel" element.
> 
> Paragraphs
> A paragraph is a block of plain text, possibly containing any number of inline elements defined in the Inline elements section above, with one or more blank lines above and below it.
> 
> This is a paragraph.
> 
> And this is *another* paragraph containing some emphasized text.
> A new line, but still part of the same paragraph.
> 
> Headers
> A document can be split up into different sections using headers. Headers use the following syntax:
> 
> # Level One
> ## Level Two
> ### Level Three
> #### Level Four
> ##### Level Five
> ###### Level Six
> 
> A header line can contain any inline syntax in the same way as a paragraph can.
> 
> Tip
> Try to avoid using too many levels of header within a single document. A heavily nested document may be indicative of a need to restructure it or split it into several pages covering separate topics.
> 
> Code blocks
> Source code can be displayed as a literal block using an indent of four spaces as shown in the following example.
> 
> This is a paragraph.
> 
>     function func(x)
>         # ...
>     end
> 
> Another paragraph.
> 
> Additionally, code blocks can be enclosed using triple backticks with an optional "language" to specify how a block of code should be highlighted.
> 
> A code block without a "language":
> 
> ```
> function func(x)
>     # ...
> end
> ```
> 
> and another one with the "language" specified as `julia`:
> 
> ```julia
> function func(x)
>     # ...
> end
> ```
> 
> Note
> "Fenced" code blocks, as shown in the last example, should be preferred over indented code blocks since there is no way to specify what language an indented code block is written in.
> 
> Block quotes
> Text from external sources, such as quotations from books or websites, can be quoted using > characters prepended to each line of the quote as follows.
> 
> Here's a quote:
> 
> > Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
> > technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other
> > technical computing environments.
> 
> Note that a single space must appear after the > character on each line. Quoted blocks may themselves contain other toplevel or inline elements.
> 
> Images
> The syntax for images is similar to the link syntax mentioned above. Prepending a ! character to a link will display an image from the specified URL rather than a link to it.
> 
> ![alternative text](link/to/image.png)
> 
> Lists
> Unordered lists can be written by prepending each item in a list with either *, +, or -.
> 
> A list of items:
> 
>   * item one
>   * item two
>   * item three
> 
> Note the two spaces before each * and the single space after each one.
> 
> Lists can contain other nested toplevel elements such as lists, code blocks, or quoteblocks. A blank line should be left between each list item when including any toplevel elements within a list.
> 
> Another list:
> 
>   * item one
> 
>   * item two
> 
>     ```
>     f(x) = x
>     ```
> 
>   * And a sublist:
> 
>       + sub-item one
>       + sub-item two
> 
> Note
> The contents of each item in the list must line up with the first line of the item. In the above example the fenced code block must be indented by four spaces to align with the i in item two.
> 
> Ordered lists are written by replacing the "bullet" character, either *, +, or -, with a positive integer followed by either . or ).
> 
> Two ordered lists:
> 
>  1. item one
>  2. item two
>  3. item three
> 
>  5) item five
>  6) item six
>  7) item seven
> 
> An ordered list may start from a number other than one, as in the second list of the above example, where it is numbered from five. As with unordered lists, ordered lists can contain nested toplevel elements.
> 
> Display equations
> Large 
> LaTeX
> L 
> A
>  T 
> E
> ​
>  X equations that do not fit inline within a paragraph may be written as display equations using a fenced code block with the "language" math as in the example below.
> 
> ```math
> f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi} (\alpha+R\cos(\theta))d\theta
> ```
> 
> Footnotes
> This syntax is paired with the inline syntax for Footnote references. Make sure to read that section as well.
> 
> Footnote text is defined using the following syntax, which is similar to footnote reference syntax, aside from the : character that is appended to the footnote label.
> 
> [^1]: Numbered footnote text.
> 
> [^note]:
> 
>     Named footnote text containing several toplevel elements.
> 
>       * item one
>       * item two
>       * item three
> 
>     ```julia
>     function func(x)
>         # ...
>     end
>     ```
> 
> Note
> No checks are done during parsing to make sure that all footnote references have matching footnotes.
> 
> Horizontal rules
> The equivalent of an <hr> HTML tag can be achieved using three hyphens (---). For example:
> 
> Text above the line.
> 
> ---
> 
> And text below the line.
> 
> Tables
> Basic tables can be written using the syntax described below. Note that markdown tables have limited features and cannot contain nested toplevel elements unlike other elements discussed above – only inline elements are allowed. Tables must always contain a header row with column names. Cells cannot span multiple rows or columns of the table.
> 
> | Column One | Column Two | Column Three |
> |:---------- | ---------- |:------------:|
> | Row `1`    | Column `2` |              |
> | *Row* 2    | **Row** 2  | Column ``3`` |
> 
> Note
> As illustrated in the above example each column of | characters must be aligned vertically.
> 
> A : character on either end of a column's header separator (the row containing - characters) specifies whether the row is left-aligned, right-aligned, or (when : appears on both ends) center-aligned. Providing no : characters will default to right-aligning the column.
> 
> Admonitions
> Specially formatted blocks, known as admonitions, can be used to highlight particular remarks. They can be defined using the following !!! syntax:
> 
> !!! note
> 
>     This is the content of the note.
> 
> !!! warning "Beware!"
> 
>     And this is another one.
> 
>     This warning admonition has a custom title: `"Beware!"`.
> 
> The first word after !!! declares the type of the admonition. There are standard admonition types that should produce special styling. Namely (in order of decreasing severity): danger, warning, info/note, and tip.
> 
> You can also use your own admonition types, as long as the type name only contains lowercase Latin characters (a-z). For example, you could have a terminology block like this:
> 
> !!! terminology "julia vs Julia"
> 
>     Strictly speaking, "Julia" refers to the language,
>     and "julia" to the standard implementation.
> 
> However, unless the code rendering the Markdown special-cases that particular admonition type, it will get the default styling.
> 
> A custom title for the box can be provided as a string (in double quotes) after the admonition type. If no title text is specified after the admonition type, then the type name will be used as the title (e.g. "Note" for the note admonition).
> 
> Admonitions, like most other toplevel elements, can contain other toplevel elements (e.g. lists, images).
> 
> Markdown Syntax Extensions
> Julia's markdown supports interpolation in a very similar way to basic string literals, with the difference that it will store the object itself in the Markdown tree (as opposed to converting it to a string). When the Markdown content is rendered the usual show methods will be called, and these can be overridden as usual. This design allows the Markdown to be extended with arbitrarily complex features (such as references) without cluttering the basic syntax.
> 
> In principle, the Markdown parser itself can also be arbitrarily extended by packages, or an entirely custom flavour of Markdown can be used, but this should generally be unnecessary.
> ===
> 
> Can you suggest a pandoc command (or something else) that will produce a clean conversion from LaTeX to markdown for Documenter.jl?
**assistant**:
> Converting LaTeX documents to Markdown, especially for use with Documenter.jl, can be a bit tricky due to differences in syntax and features. Pandoc is indeed a powerful tool for this task, but specific options may be needed to fine-tune the conversion for Documenter.jl's expectations.
> 
> Here's a pandoc command example with some options that might help clean up the conversion:
> 
> ```sh
> pandoc -f latex -t markdown \
>        --strip-comments \
>        --atx-headers \
>        --wrap=none \
>        --standalone \
>        --filter pandoc-citeproc \
>        -o output.md input.tex
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation of Options:
> - `-f latex`: Specifies that the input format is LaTeX.
> - `-t markdown`: Specifies that the output format is Markdown.
> - `--strip-comments`: Removes LaTeX comments from the document.
> - `--atx-headers`: Uses ATX-style headers (with `#`) instead of setext-style (underlines), which is generally preferred in Markdown.
> - `--wrap=none`: Prevents line wrapping in the output, which helps keep the Markdown clean and readable for further edits.
> - `--standalone`: Makes the output a standalone file (includes metadata).
> - `--filter pandoc-citeproc`: Processes citations, which might be helpful if your document contains bibliographies.
> 
> You can adjust this command based on the specific features of your LaTeX documents. For instance, if you have custom LaTeX commands, you might need to write a `pandoc` filter to handle those specifically.
> 
> Additionally, after conversion, you may need to manually adjust certain parts of the Markdown output to align perfectly with Documenter.jl's Markdown syntax or to use its cross-referencing capabilities.
> 
> If you encounter specific elements that still don't convert well, feel free to share, and I can help devise more specific solutions!
**user**:
> I get a bunch of `[WARNING] Citeproc: citation XXX not found` messages. How do I tell pandoc about my bib file?
**assistant**:
> To inform Pandoc about your BibTeX bibliography file and resolve citation warnings, you need to add the `--bibliography` option to your Pandoc command. This option specifies the path to your `.bib` file, which will allow Pandoc to look up citations during the conversion process.
> 
> Here’s how you can modify the command:
> 
> ```sh
> pandoc -f latex -t markdown \
>        --strip-comments \
>        --atx-headers \
>        --wrap=none \
>        --standalone \
>        --bibliography=your-bibliography.bib \
>        --filter pandoc-citeproc \
>        -o output.md input.tex
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation of the New Option:
> - `--bibliography=your-bibliography.bib`: Replace `your-bibliography.bib` with the path to your actual BibTeX file. This tells Pandoc where to find the citation data.
> 
> After adding this option, rerun the command, and the warnings about citations not being found should be resolved as long as the citations in your LaTeX document match those in your `.bib` file. If you have multiple bibliography files, you can specify them by repeating the `--bibliography` option.
> 
> If you continue to have issues or there's something particular in your citations causing problems, let me know!
**user**:
> The figures show up pretty poorly. The references to them get rendered like `Figures [fig:climate_module]{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:climatemodule"}` and the figure themselves lose their captions.
**assistant**:
> To handle LaTeX figures properly during the conversion to Markdown with Pandoc, there are a few strategies you can employ to improve the output. 
> 
> 1. **Convert figures manually**: If your LaTeX figures lose their formatting and captions, you might need to convert them manually after the initial Pandoc conversion. Typically, the structure of a figure in LaTeX looks something like this:
> 
>    ```latex
>    \begin{figure}
>        \centering
>        \includegraphics{path/to/figure.png}
>        \caption{This is a caption.}
>        \label{fig:climate_module}
>    \end{figure}
>    ```
> 
>    After conversion, you should manually ensure they appear in Markdown like this:
> 
>    ```markdown
>    ![This is a caption.](path/to/figure.png)
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Use Pandoc filters**: To process your LaTeX documents more intelligently, you could use a Pandoc filter like `pandoc-figure-caption`. This filter can help retain figure captions and labels after conversion:
> 
>    ```sh
>    pandoc -f latex -t markdown \
>           --strip-comments \
>           --atx-headers \
>           --wrap=none \
>           --standalone \
>           --bibliography=your-bibliography.bib \
>           --filter pandoc-figure-caption \
>           -o output.md input.tex
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Adjust figure references in LaTeX**: Make sure that your figure references in the LaTeX document are clear and straightforward. For example, if your labels are defined correctly, this should help Pandoc pick them up better. The figure command should be correctly formatted for referencing.
> 
> 4. **Post-process the Markdown**: After the conversion, if additional formatting is still needed for figure references, you could run a simple script or use search-and-replace tools to clean those references.
> 
> ### Example of Manual Fixes
> 
> After conversion, if you find Markdown like this for figure references:
> 
> ```markdown
> Figures [fig:climate_module]
> ```
> 
> You can transform it into something more coherent manually:
> 
> ```markdown
> See ![Figure 1: This is a caption.](path/to/climate_module.png) for details.
> ```
> 
> ### Summary
> 
> In summary, for the best results with figures and their captions when converting from LaTeX to Markdown with Pandoc:
> - Consider using a dedicated Pandoc filter for figures.
> - Prepare to manipulate figures and their references manually after conversion.
> - Ensure your LaTeX figure commands are set up correctly.
> 
> If you're still facing specific issues even after trying these methods, feel free to share more details, and I can assist further!
**user**:
> Also, the citations look weird. You see in the final rendered produce things like `[@kessler2017estimating]`, rather than the author year.
**assistant**:
> To format citations correctly so that they appear as author-year styles instead of the raw citation keys (like `[@kessler2017estimating]`), you'll need to ensure you're using the proper citation style with Pandoc. This can be accomplished by specifying a citation style file (CSL) when running the conversion. 
> 
> Here’s how you can refine your Pandoc command:
> 
> 1. **Choose a CSL Style**: Select a citation style appropriate for your needs. You can find many styles at the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles) or the [CSL GitHub repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles).
> 
> 2. **Update the Command**: Add the `--citeproc` option along with the `--bibliography` and mention the desired CSL file with the `--csl` option. Here’s an updated command example:
> 
> ```sh
> pandoc -f latex -t markdown \
>        --strip-comments \
>        --atx-headers \
>        --wrap=none \
>        --standalone \
>        --bibliography=your-bibliography.bib \
>        --csl=path/to/citation-style.csl \
>        --citeproc \
>        -o output.md input.tex
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation of New Options:
> - `--csl=path/to/citation-style.csl`: Replace this with the actual file path of the citation style you want to use.
> - `--citeproc`: This tells Pandoc to process citations and format them according to the specified CSL style.
> 
> ### Example Citation Style
> If you want to use the APA style, your command may look like the following if you downloaded the APA CSL file:
> 
> ```sh
> pandoc -f latex -t markdown \
>        --strip-comments \
>        --atx-headers \
>        --wrap=none \
>        --standalone \
>        --bibliography=your-bibliography.bib \
>        --csl=path/to/apa.csl \
>        --citeproc \
>        -o output.md input.tex
> ```
> 
> ### Summary
> Using the `--csl` option along with `--citeproc` should resolve the issue with citations showing up as raw keys. Instead, they should format correctly as author-year styles when you convert your document. If the problem persists after doing this, double-check your bibliography file for correct formatting and entries. Let me know if you have any further questions!
