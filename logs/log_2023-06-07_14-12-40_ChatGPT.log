> Is it right to say "It could be Alice, Bob, and I." or "It could be Alice, Bob, and me."?
**assistant**:
> The correct phrase is "It could be Alice, Bob, and me." 
> 
> This is because the pronoun is the object of the verb "be." The rule of thumb is to use "I" when it is the subject of a verb, and "me" when it is the object of a verb or preposition.

> An easy way to check this is to remove the other people from the sentence and see if it still makes sense. "It could be I" sounds incorrect, while "It could be me" sounds correct.
