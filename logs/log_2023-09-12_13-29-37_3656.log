**user**:
> My new PhD student, recently arrived from China, gave me a gift of a boxed set of tea cups and two boxes of tea. How should I show that I appreciate the gift?
**assistant**:
> Receiving a gift from your new PhD student is a thoughtful gesture and it's great that you want to show your appreciation. Here are a few suggestions for expressing your gratitude:
> 
> 1. Thank them personally: Take a moment to personally express your appreciation to your student. You can do this in person or through a heartfelt email. Let them know how much their gift means to you and express your gratitude for their thoughtfulness.
> 
> 2. Utilize the gift: Incorporate the tea cups and tea into your daily routine. Brew a cup of tea using the gifted tea and use the cups during your work or relaxation time. Whenever you use the gift, it will serve as a reminder of your student's gesture and your appreciation.
> 
> 3. Learn about the tea: Take some time to learn about the type of tea you received. Explore its origins, brewing techniques, and cultural significance. This will not only deepen your appreciation for the gift but also show your interest in your student's culture.
> 
> 4. Share the experience: Consider inviting your PhD student for a tea session. You can brew the tea together and spend some time discussing their experiences, research, or anything else that helps you build a stronger relationship. This shared experience will not only show your appreciation but also create an opportunity for meaningful conversation.
> 
> 5. Keep the connection: As your PhD student settles into their new environment, make an effort to offer your support and guidance. Show interest in their research and progress, and offer assistance whenever possible. A gesture of appreciation is best shown by continuing to be a supportive mentor and colleague.
> 
> Remember that expressing gratitude is a personal gesture, and it's important to be sincere and authentic in your appreciation. By demonstrating your gratitude, you not only acknowledge the gift but also contribute to a positive and productive working relationship with your new PhD student.
**user**:
> Does it matter if the gift is visible in my office?
**assistant**:
> Whether or not to display the gift in your office is ultimately a personal decision. Here are a few considerations to help you decide:
> 
> 1. Cultural context: Consider cultural norms and practices surrounding the display of gifts. In some cultures, it is common and expected to showcase gifts in the workplace as a way to acknowledge the giver and show appreciation. In other cultures, displaying gifts in a professional setting may not be as common. Understanding your student's cultural background can provide insight into their intentions and expectations.
> 
> 2. Office decor and space: Assess the available space and overall aesthetic of your office. If displaying the gift aligns well with your office decor and doesn't create clutter or disrupt your workspace, it can be a nice way to showcase your appreciation and create a welcoming environment.
> 
> 3. Personal preference: Ultimately, the decision to display the gift should align with your personal preferences and comfort level. If you prefer to keep your office minimalistic or private, you may choose to appreciate the gift in a more personal way, such as using the tea cups for personal use or keeping them safely stored when not in use.
> 
> 4. Visibility to others: Consider whether displaying the gift will have an impact on others who visit your office. If you anticipate that the gift will spark conversations or create a positive atmosphere, it can be beneficial to have it visible. However, if you prefer to keep your personal gifts more private, you may choose to display them in a more discreet area.
> 
> Ultimately, the important thing is that you genuinely appreciate the gift and convey your gratitude to your PhD student. Whether you choose to display the gift or not, expressing your appreciation through personal interactions and using the gift in a meaningful way will convey your gratefulness.
