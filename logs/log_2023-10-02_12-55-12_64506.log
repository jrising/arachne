**user**:
> Does a mutate command that follows a group_by command in dplyr get called separately for each group?
**assistant**:
> Yes, in `dplyr`, when you use `mutate()` after a `group_by()`, the mutation is applied separately to each group. This is one of the central features of `group_by()`. 
> 
> For example, assume you have a dataset and you want to subtract the mean of a variable from each observation, but the mean should be computed within each group:
> 
> ```r
> df %>%
>   group_by(group) %>%
>   mutate(centered_variable = variable - mean(variable))
> ```
> 
> In this context, `group_by(group)` indicates that `mutate()` should apply its operations separately to each group in the dataset. So `mean(variable)` is calculated for each group independently, and then each value in `variable` has the mean of its group subtracted from it, creating `centered_variable`.
> 
> Remember, the `group_by()` will still be in effect until explicitly removed by `ungroup()`.
