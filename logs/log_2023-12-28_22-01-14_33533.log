>  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association estimates that coral reef ecosystems are home to over one million undiscovered species. Reefs play an essential role in humans' way of life, providing many ecosystem services, intrinsic value, and tourism. This ecosystem is being destroyed at an alarming rate due to coral bleaching, ocean acidification, overfishing, increased natural disasters, and other threats. Research has shown that coral reef systems are being damaged beyond repair and soon may become extinct due to pollution and warming water temperatures associated with climate change and other socioeconomic factors. With a rapid decline in coral reef systems, scientists are concerned about marine life biodiversity due to the destruction of the coral reef systems.
> Beyond serving as vital habitats for marine life, these reefs provide coastal storm protection, support local fishing industries, and anchor the region's flourishing tourism and ecotourism sectors. However, recent research underscores a looming threat - the correlation between heat stress, exacerbated by rising sea surface temperatures (SST), increased tourism, and severe bleaching events that cast a shadow over the once-vibrant coral ecosystems of the Florida Keys. CREMP data of population abundance over 10 years are gathered and archived by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA. These data charts assess how coral reef biodiversity and the environment changed over time by analyzing the population changes in coral species. This study examines the yearly abundance of the representative coral species Acropora palmata to reveal diverse associations among water temperature, tourism, ecotourism, bleaching rate, and the coral recovery rate of Molasses Reef in the Florida Keys.
> In our coastal areas, we prioritize the health of coral reefs, mainly focusing on two key factors: Coral Recovery Rate and Bleaching Rate. Investigating how quickly corals recover from disturbances, such as bleaching events, is essential for understanding the region's natural dynamics. The growing influence of elevated sea temperatures and pollution on coral bleaching events in the Florida Keys makes closely monitoring the bleaching rate increasingly vital. The economic well-being of the Florida Keys relies heavily on Tourism and Ecotourism, as the region's appeal to visitors, attracted by its stunning coral reefs, is linked to these ecosystems. Consequently, the economic prosperity of the Keys is directly tied to

>  coral health, and any decline could result in reduced tourism revenue, impacting the livelihoods of many residents. Balancing vital natural and human factors requires careful equilibrium. Finding harmony between conservation and economic needs is crucial for the lasting well-being of the Florida Keys..
> Our model research is centered on investigating the potential effects of ecotourism on the conservation of coral reefs, with a specific emphasis on ecologically sensitive locations such as the Florida Keys. We seek to answer the question: Can a particular level of ecotourism positively impact mitigating coral bleaching, and how does sea surface temperature influence this dynamic? The primary objective is to ascertain whether specific ecotourism practices contribute significantly to the overall health of coral reefs and to understand the role of sea surface temperature in shaping this relationship.
> Well-managed ecotourism can positively impact coral reef ecosystems. It has the potential to raise visitor awareness, turning them into conservation advocates. Revenue from ecotourism can fund crucial conservation projects. Responsible practices, like guided tours, minimize physical damage and pollution, aligning economic interests with conservation goals to sustain coral environments. Despite improved ecotourism practices, adverse impacts like increased visitation and sunscreen pollution may affect coral environments. Economic challenges and fund misallocation could limit ecotourism's effectiveness in generating conservation funds. Ecotourism may not fully address broader issues like climate change and ocean acidification, highlighting the need for additional conservation measures to thoroughly preserve coral environments.

>  Figure 1: Dynamic Coupled System Model: Illustration of the interactive relationships within a dynamic coupled system, where human activities, such as ecotourism and normal tourism, impact the overall well-being of coral reef ecosystems.
> This model represents a dynamic coupled system in which human activities such as ecotourism and normal tourism influence the overall well-being of the natural system of coral reefs. The state of the coral reef itself also influences human activities and revenue that could positively impact coral reef health and cover. The rising temperatures of the natural environment are an exogenous factor that cannot be controlled within our simulation. It negatively impacts the health of the coral ecosystem by influencing the coral bleaching rate. Therefore, we have introduced ecotourism as a human intervention to stabilize the bleaching rate. Ecotourism also contributes to funding for coral seeding, which would improve coral cover and overall health by funding coral seeding and coral protection practices.
> In this model, rising temperatures will be a positive feedback loop that continuously increases coral health and cover bleaching rates. Thus, this creates a feedback loop in human activities (ecotourism/tourism) because declining coral health can deter visitors. To compare the results of human interventions to a scenario without any interventions, we have included two coral reef stocks in our model. The unprotected coral stock will have an additional decline rate due to normal tourism practices, and the protected coral stock will not be impacted by normal tourism. For the unprotected coral stock, normal tourism practices act as negative feedback for the coral health decline rate, where initially, as normal tourism increases, the coral health decline rate will increase. However, over time, as coral health declines, tourism will decrease and eventually could lead to a reduced decline rate. As coral health declines due to an increased rate of decline, and normal tourism declines due to its loss of attraction, together, this also declines the total expected revenue from tourism, acting as another reinforcing positive feedback loop to the decline of coral health. The protected coral reef stock is not impacted by normal tourism, and its decline is only impacted by rising temperatures (bleaching rate). However, this stock is positively impacted by ecotourism practices and coral seeding, which create a positive feedback loop in the stock's recovery rate. Coral seeding will be impacted by the percentage of ecotourism, serving as
> 3
> 
>  positive feedback. If ecotourism percent increases, coral seeding increases, and conversely, if ecotourism decreases, coral seeding will decrease. While the coral seeding efforts positively impact both reef stocks, recovery efforts depend on recovery funding. The recovery funding is generated from a portion of the total expected tourism revenue and is based on the percentage of ecotourism relative to normal tourism. Thus, we will manipulate recovery funding to mitigate the decline of coral reefs. Recovery funding directly impacts the number of acres of coral seeded, acting as a positive feedback loop for coral cover, where increases in recovery funding result in more acres seeded and vice versa. As coral cover increases, this will serve as another reinforcing positive feedback loop to the human system where ecotourism will increase, and more recovery funding will be generated, increasing the coral cover and attracting more and more tourists.
> This model measured temperature in degrees Celsius and obtained from the NOAA Buoy Data Center. The bleaching rate will represent the impact of temperature on coral health and is measured yearly, which measures the percent change of coral cover per year. Coral stocks will be monitored and measured as % coral cover in a 50 km2 Keys region. The coral stocks' tourism/bleaching rates of decline and recovery rates will be measured as % coral cover per year that is lost (decline) or gained (recovery). Tourism and ecotourism will be measured in millions of dollars, and their amounts vary depending on the percentage of tourism activity (normal vs. ecotourism). Total expected tourism revenue will be measured as millions of dollars, where this amount is derived from revenues generated from expected ecotourism and normal tourism and is also dependent on the ratio of percent coral cover (protected or unprotected) to total coral cover of both stocks. Recovery funding will be measured in millions of dollars, depending on the proportion of ecotourism. Lastly, acres seeded will be measured in units of acres, and the amount of recovery funding impacts this value.
> This model will provide insights into coral decline thresholds that negatively impact tourism and expected revenue. It is designed to show normal tourism-driven decline and the stabilization of coral health and cover resulting from ecotourism intervention. In addition to the stabilization effect, it can also

>  show an amplification effect of coral health decline when we simulate scenarios with lesser ecotourism intervention.
> Our simulation time settings will follow 10 years, with the time step per year. We utilized Euler’s Method as the chosen simulation algorithm. The simulation starts at 0 years and ends after 10 years. Our standards for tourism funding were 6 million dollars and a ratio of 20% ecotourism and 80% tourism.
> For our model, we tested the outer boundaries and extremes of the model as well as applicable scenarios. For SST, within the model's constraints, our SST extremes include 0°C and 49°C. While these boundary tests are relatively inapplicable to current projections, they helped us examine model functions and develop baselines to compare them while examining how SST affects the model’s coupled variables. We then tested ecotourism and how funding affects projected coral cover in the area.
> Sea Surface Temperature and its Effect on Coupled Model Variables
> Tourism and ecotourism are the focus of this report. However, these types of tourism do not occur within the isolation of a system and determine the societal impact on variables that affect coral health and cover, such as sea surface temperature (SST). Figure 2 demonstrates that SST significantly impacts the other coupled variables of our model, and a rise in SST is positively correlated with bleaching rate and negatively correlated with protected and unprotected coral cover and health.

> Tourism Funding and its Effect on Coupled Model Variables
> For our testing, we modified the Total Expected Tourism variable by increasing and decreasing the funding allocated to see how it plays a role in coral cover and health. The Total Expected Tourism variable is “6* [Total Coral] / .068” with units of millions of dollars, with the 6 representing a potential scenario of 6 million dollars of funding, such as the University of Miami researchers who were awarded $6 million in 2019 for coral reef restoration in Southeast Florida (Udel, 2023). We examined a few scenarios, including $0, $6 million, and $50 million, with $0 and $50 million meant to provide extremes for our testing purposes. For SST, our model will use the global surface temperature from 2018 (15.06°C, +1.06°C above the 20th-century average of 14.0°C) and hold it at a constant value to isolate any potential interference associated with SST.
> We can see from Figures 3 - 7 that funding significantly impacts projected tourism, ecotourism, and protected and unprotected coral amounts. The bleaching rate is static due to SST being held at a constant 15.06°C. Despite the absence of SST influence, under the $0 scenario, projected tourism and
> 
>  ecotourism do not see growth, while protected coral increases and unprotected coral decreases. With the $6 million scenario, we see a significant increase in ecotourism and tourism. Protected and unprotected coral both increase in this scenario. The $50 million scenario sees a highly significant increase in every metric besides the bleaching rate and unprotected coral, with ecotourism, tourism, and protected coral increasing by an immense magnitude. Unprotected coral begins to rise initially but then experiences sudden collapse toward the end of the simulation due to extreme increases in tourism, as seen in Figure 7.

> We adjust ecoturism and normal tourism percentages to analyze how the ratio between these two types of tourism affects coupled variables in the model. We maintained the standard 6 million value in Total Expected Tourism and 15.06°C in SST. For these scenarios, we tested this % tourism variable's upper and lower bounds, with 0% ecotourism and 100% tourism and 40% ecotourism and 60% tourism. This will provide us with a range between our standard of ±20% for each type of tourism.
> Figures 8 through 12 demonstrate the effect different ratios of tourism and ecotourism have on our model. We see with 0% ecotourism and 100% tourism a flattening of tourism overall, with increases in protected coral and decreases in unprotected coral as seen in figures 9 and 10 respectively. With 40% ecotourism and 60% tourism, we see a significant increase in both protected and unprotected coral as well as projected ecotourism and tourism, as seen in figures 11 and 12 respectively.

>  Conclusion
> The elevated sea surface temperature (SST) of 15.06 degrees Celsius has resulted in a decline in ecotourism and normal tourism. However, higher revenue for restoration efforts in the tourism sector offset this setback. The increased funds contribute to a rise in total coral cover, primarily attributed to intensified coral seeding initiatives. Our model's real-world implications extend to informing adaptive conservation measures in response to decreased ecotourism and normal tourism during heightened sea surface temperatures (SST). Stakeholders can use the model's findings for informed decision-making, particularly in understanding financial dynamics and leveraging increased restoration revenue within the tourism sector. This insight is crucial for crafting effective conservation strategies and directing resources toward initiatives promoting coral health and resilience. The model aids researchers in tailoring grant proposals by offering insights into the 10-year impact of SST on coral. This information enables strategic resource allocation, allowing researchers to address funding needs accurately and tackle specific challenges posed by changing environmental conditions. In essence, our model contributes not only to scientific understanding but also offers practical guidance for real-world conservation efforts, funding decisions, and research planning, ultimately enhancing the sustainability of coral reef ecosystems.
> While our model provides valuable insights, it is essential to acknowledge several limitations. One significant limitation is that coral decline in the real world is not solely temperature-based; other factors such as pollution, water quality, acidification, and natural disasters play crucial roles. Additionally,
> 
>  given its relatively new concept, the need for extensive data on ecotourism poses a challenge. Simulating coral occurrences is another limitation, and the funding variability adds complexity to our findings' real-world application. Furthermore, our model focuses on the specific species of Acropora palmata, and the impact on other coral species remains unexplored. Despite these limitations, our model is valuable for understanding specific aspects of the complex dynamics between ecotourism, sea surface temperature, and coral health.

**assistant**:
> **Abstract**
> 
> **Motivation & Context:** Coral reefs, such as those in the Florida Keys, offer critical ecosystem services and serve as a hub for tourism and ecotourism. However, they face threats from climate-related factors like rising sea surface temperatures (SST) leading to coral bleaching, and from socioeconomic activities. This paper by Marchak et al. explores the dynamics between ecotourism, SST, and coral reef health.
> 
> **Model:** The authors developed a dynamic coupled system model to analyze the impacts of human activities (ecotourism and normal tourism) on the health and cover of coral reefs, using the representative coral species *Acropora palmata*. The model integrates variables like tourism revenue, bleaching rate due to SST, and coral recovery rate, simulated over 10 years using Euler’s Method. It includes two scenarios: protected coral reefs impacted only by rising temperatures, and unprotected reefs affected by tourism activities and temperatures.
> 
> **Results:** The study found that ecotourism and normal tourism, affected by SST, influence coral health and cover. Higher SST was linked to increased bleaching rates and reduced coral cover. Conversely, appropriate levels of ecotourism funding can mitigate these effects through conservation efforts such as coral seeding, creating a positive feedback loop for coral cover. The model revealed thresholds of coral decline that affect tourism and showed both declines and stabilization scenarios in the presence of varying levels of ecotourism intervention.
> 
> **Policy Implications:** The research provides critical insights for policymakers and stakeholders to consider the balance between tourism and coral conservation in the Florida Keys. It suggests that directing resources from ecotourism revenue towards restoration and conservation strategies may help sustain these vital ecosystems. Moreover, the model can aid in decision-making and guide the allocation of funding for long-term coral health and resilience, promoting a sustainable nexus between economic activities and ecosystem preservation. The study also underscores the need for broader conservation measures beyond ecotourism to address systemic issues like climate change.
