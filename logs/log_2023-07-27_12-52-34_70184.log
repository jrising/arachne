**assistant**:
> The IT department is asking you about the additional security measures you will take to mitigate potential attacks, particularly considering their consideration of giving you a firewall exception. Fail2Ban is a great start as it will ban IP addresses that show malicious signs like too many password failures and seeking exploits. However, there are additional measures you could take:
> 
> **1. Local Firewall Configuration**
> 
> With Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), you can configure which services and ports can accept connections, including limiting the connections to certain IP addresses or subnets for better security. For example, you may only allow SSH connections from your personal IP or the IP range of your organization.
> 
> **2. Automatic Software Updates**
> 
> Consistently updating your system can protect it from known vulnerabilities that have patches available. You could set your Ubuntu server to automatically install security updates.
> 
> **3. SSH Hardening**
> 
> Securing your SSH further is something you need to consider. You can consider steps like disabling root login, using key-based authentication instead of password-based, changing the default port, and using a tool like DenyHosts or Fail2Ban.
> 
> **4. Regular Backups**
> 
> Having regular backups of your system and data may not seem like a prevention method, but being able to restore a safe version of your site is certainly a way to mitigate damage from an attack. You can consider an automatic backup tool that securely stores backups offsite.

> To answer your IT department, you could say something like:
> 
> > In addition to using Fail2Ban, I will deploy a number of mitigation measures: I will appropriately configure UFW to limit the services and ports that can accept connections. I will setup Automatic Security Update to keep server system software up to date. SSH connections will be hardened by disabling root login and using key-based authentication. Furthermore, I will establish regular and secure offsite backups of my server data for disaster recovery.

> As always, the specifics will depend on your IT environment and the details of your server setup. It might be a good idea to discuss these measures with your IT department to get their input and approval.
