> I have the following recipe for a stir-fry:
> ---
> Ingredients:
> 2 tablespoons olive oil
> 1 block (14 oz) of tofu, cubed for a complete protein source
> 1 large bell pepper (you can use any color), sliced
> 2 medium carrots, thinly sliced on the diagonal
> 4 celery stalks, thinly sliced on the diagonal
> 1 small onion, sliced
> Salt and pepper to taste
> For the stir-fry sauce:
> 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
> 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
> 1 tablespoon cornstarch
> 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup
> 1-2 cloves garlic, minced
> A pinch of crushed red pepper flakes if you like heat (optional)
> Steps:
> First, prepare the tofu. Drain it and press it to squeeze out as much water as possible. Then, cut it into cubes.
> As the tofu drains, prepare the stir-fry sauce. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, cornstarch, honey (or maple syrup), minced garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using). Set it aside.
> Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes and cook them until they’re golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Once they’re browned, remove them from the pan and set them aside.
> Add the second tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Then, add the onion, sliced bell pepper, carrots, and celery to the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender.
> Return the tofu to the pan. Stir in the sauce, making sure all the vegetables and tofu are well-coated.
> Cook for another minute or two, until the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
> Serve the stir-fry over rice or noodles, if desired.
> Enjoy your meal! This stir-fry is a great way to get a healthy dose of vegetables and protein in one dish. Plus, the sauce adds lots of flavor without being overly sweet or salty.

> Can I make the stirfry sauce from coconut milk instead?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can definitely make stir-fry sauce using coconut milk. The sauce will have a different flavor profile, but it will be delicious and add a creamy texture to your stir-fry. Here is a suggestion for a coconut-based stir-fry sauce:
> 
> Ingredients:
> - 1 can (14 oz) of full-fat coconut milk
> - 2 tablespoons of soy sauce or tamari for gluten-free options
> - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch as a thickening agent
> - 1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup for a hint of sweetness
> - 1-2 cloves of garlic, minced
> - 1 small piece of ginger, grated
> - A pinch of crushed red pepper flakes if you like heat (optional)
> 
> Steps:
> 1. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the coconut milk, soy sauce (or tamari), honey (or maple syrup), minced garlic, grated ginger, and red pepper flakes (if using).
> 2. In a separate bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water until you get a smooth mixture, then add this to the saucepan. This will help thicken the sauce.
> 3. Let the sauce simmer for about 5-10 minutes or until it thickens up a bit. Don't let it get too thick, though; it should be a pourable consistency.
> 4. Add the sauce to your stir-fry as directed in the initial recipe.
> 
> Enjoy your dish with a new, tropical twist!
> 
> Do note that the coconut sauce will have a milder taste compared to the soy sauce-based stir-fry sauce. If you want the taste to be stronger, consider adding more spices or perhaps a dash of fish sauce for an umami taste (although this would omit the vegan aspect of the tofu stir-fry).
