> The literature on the social cost of carbon (SCC) is large and growing, with substantial differences in underlying assumptions across and at times within studies. Of particular interest are changes to the structure of integrated assessment models (IAMs) -- `structural changes' -- including Earth system processes, tipping points, substitutability of ecosystem services, persistence of damages to economic output, preferences over societal risk and inequality, and how learning new information affects policy. These structural changes have often been analyzed in piecemeal, uncoordinated fashion, leaving their relative importance unclear. We here analyze 1823 estimates of the SCC from 147 studies published between 2000 and 2020 to isolate the effects of 9 structural changes alongside 6 preference parameters and 14 dimensions of uncertainty. We additionally survey the authors of these studies, and analyze the perceived role of structural changes across 66 respondents. We find that the distribution of published SCCs and the distribution of experts' comprehensive estimates of SCCs have diverged from the formal US SCC estimate, particularly in the right tail. The structural changes with the greatest effects on the SCC are persistent damages to economic output, limited substitutability of ecosystem services, and changes to Earth system processes. %In comparison, discounting and standard damage function parameters appear to play a smaller role in final SCC values than structural changes, per both the literature and surveyed experts. 
> Finally, we calibrate a Random Forest model of SCC values, and use expert assessments of the structural changes to construct a Synthetic SCC and its distribution. While the mean of experts' central best SCC estimate amounts to \$160, the mean Synthetic SCC estimate is \$467 per ton of CO2 (2020 US dollars), which is significantly larger than the current formal US SCC estimate.

> These all include subtitles, and do not have active verbs. It should be something like "Structural changes drive the social cost of carbon".
