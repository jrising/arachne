**assistant**:
> In JavaScript, the `fetch` function is inherently asynchronous, which means it's designed to be used with `await` or promises for handling the asynchronous nature of network requests. If you need to make synchronous HTTP requests—which is generally not recommended for performance reasons—you can use `XMLHttpRequest`, but keep in mind that synchronous requests are only supportable in a web worker context in modern browsers and should be avoided due to their ability to block the main thread.

>     xhr.open("GET", url, false); // third parameter 'false' makes it synchronous
>     xhr.send();
>     
>     if (xhr.status === 200) {
>         return xhr.responseText;
>     } else {
>         throw new Error(`Request failed with status ${xhr.status}`);
>     }
> }
> 
> try {
>     const result = fetchSync('https://example.com');
>     console.log(result);
> } catch (error) {
>     console.error(error);

> ### Important Considerations:
> - **Deprecated Practices**: Synchronous XHR is considered a deprecated practice in most cases due to its blocking nature on the main thread. It can lead to a poor user experience, especially if the network is slow or the server takes a while to respond.
> - **Alternatives**: If possible, rework your application logic to handle asynchronous requests with `fetch`, promises, or async/await. Non-blocking operations improve performance and maintain a responsive user interface.
> - **Service Workers and Web Workers**: If you find yourself needing synchronous behavior in a more controlled environment, consider using service workers or web workers to offload these tasks from the main thread.

> If you provide more context or your specific constraints, I might be able to help devise a more suitable approach for handling your data fetching needs in a way that aligns with modern web development best practices.
