> **Title:** Insights and Applications for the Social Cost of Carbon  
> **Authors:** James Rising, Frances Moore, Peter Howard
> 
> **Introduction:**  
> Between 2013 and 2023, the central value of damages from greenhouse gas emissions used in cost-benefit analysis by the United States Environmental Protection Agency rose from $52 per ton of CO2 to $190 per ton (2020 USD). This update to the “social cost of carbon” (SCC) represented both significant progress in the understanding of climate impacts and improvements in methodological practices. One implication is that the discounted present value of damages from emissions released in 2023 amounts to 7.4% of current global gross domestic product (GGDP). Other recent estimates have suggested even greater damages at $1,367 tCO2\-1 (Bilal & Känzig 2024), or 53.6% of current GGDP.
> 
> Such values have significant policy implications. High SCCs imply high benefits to mitigation, and imply that more costly actions today are beneficial to avoid future losses. The highest SCC values suggest that rapid decarbonization is beneficial even unilaterally, irrespective of the level of international cooperation.
> 
> However, the SCC is characterized by massive uncertainties, based on far future climate impacts and socioeconomics, several key structural decisions that are the subject of ongoing academic debates, and valuation assumptions that necessarily embed ethical choices. The proper use and assumptions behind SCC values may be opaque to policy-makers. Continued improvements in the understanding of damages may act as a deterrent to making policy decisions based on existing estimates.
> 
> This review aims at clarifying the state of the art and current application of the SCC across the climate economics literature, its inputs into policy discussions, and the prospects for future improvements. We also identify recent trends in the scientific process around the SCC, and likely directions for the future.

> I have been asked for a synopsis, and I'm not sure that this fits the bill (it's more of an outline, with a pitch for the introduction). Can you translate this into a synopsis appropriate for sharing with NCC?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, James! Here's a refined synopsis that captures the essence of your proposal, making it suitable for submission to *Nature Climate Change*:
> 
> **Synopsis:**
> 
> The social cost of carbon (SCC) has become a cornerstone metric in climate economics, reflecting the monetary valuation of future climate damages from greenhouse gas emissions. This review aims to elucidate the progress in understanding and applying the SCC, its critical role in policy-making, and avenues for future research.
> 
> Over the past decade, estimates of the SCC have significantly increased from $52 to $190 per ton of CO2, highlighting profound advancements in climate impact assessments and methodological rigor. These evolving estimates carry immense policy implications by influencing cost-benefit analyses of climate actions, effectively guiding mitigation strategies even in scenarios lacking full international cooperation.
> 
> However, substantial uncertainties and debates surround the SCC, stemming from predictions of long-term climate impacts, socio-economic trajectories, and ethical considerations in valuation methods. This review will delineate current disagreements and cutting-edge discussions, outlining the SCC’s foundational assumptions, the evolution of integrated assessment models, and the integration of risk assessment in climate policy.
> 
> Further, we will explore contemporary knowledge regarding SCC contributions across sectors and models, emphasizing essential factors such as discounting methodologies and their relation to economic theories. The future of SCC research involves tackling broader economic risks, cascading climate impacts, and the role of inequality.
> 
> Finally, this paper will scrutinize the SCC’s application in policy-making, spanning its historical journey and regional uses, while assessing its influence on carbon pricing frameworks and regional SCC applications. By providing a comprehensive examination of the SCC, this review seeks to guide policymakers in utilizing this metric amidst uncertainties, fostering informed decisions to mitigate climate change effectively.

**user**:
> Can you suggest an improved version of the clause "reflecting the monetary valuation of future climate damages from greenhouse gas emissions". The problems are (1) it's the value of an additional ton (not all) of CO2 (not all GHG), and damages are already a monetary valuation, but accounting for non-market damages. But I don't want to say all that, just not misspeak.
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here’s a refined version of that clause:
> 
> "representing the estimated monetary value of the damages associated with an additional ton of CO2 emissions, including both market and non-market impacts."
> 
> This revision clarifies that it's focused on an additional ton of CO2 and acknowledges the inclusion of both market and non-market damages without unnecessary complexity. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
