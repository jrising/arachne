**user**:
> Is sediment part of bathymetry?
**assistant**:
> In a generalized sense, no. Bathymetry refers to the study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors -- essentially the underwater equivalent to topography. It involves mapping the terrain and landscape of the sea or lake bed.
> 
> Sediment, on the other hand, refers to the naturally occurring material that has been broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and has been deposited at the surface of the earth, including at the bottom of bodies of water.
> 
> However, sediment can influence bathymetric measurements and features over time. As sediment accumulates, it may alter the depth and shape of the underwater terrain. Therefore, while sediment is not part of bathymetry, it can play a significant role in shaping the features that bathymetry studies. 
> 
> To account for these changes in detailed studies, one might use "sediment bathymetry," which refers to the analysis of patterns in the distribution of sediment types under water, in conjunction with bathymetric data. Sediment bathymetry is particularly relevant in areas prone to sediment deposition or disruption, such as river deltas or regions with frequent seismic activity.
