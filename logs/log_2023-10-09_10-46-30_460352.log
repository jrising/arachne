**user**:
> I got a root canal a few weeks ago and I got a temporary crown. Now I'm supposed to go back to get my permanent crown. Will that require anesthesia or recovery?
**assistant**:
> The placement of a permanent crown typically does not require anesthesia or a significant recovery period, as the tooth has already undergone root canal treatment and is likely to be numb from the previous procedure. However, the level of anesthesia required may vary depending on the sensitivity of your tooth and your personal preference. It's best to consult with your dentist or endodontist to discuss your specific needs and determine the appropriate course of action.
