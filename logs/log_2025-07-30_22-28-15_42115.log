> Large language models have the ability to digest documents, summarize them, and extract information from documents. We develop a full soup-to-nuts system to use these abilities for systematic literature reviews. The process starts by filtering searches based on information in papers' abstract, title, and keywords. We develop a robust process that uses both OpenAI’s GPT-4o model and Gemini’s gemini-1.5-flash model like independent reviewers. These models were observed to respond differently to the information and so provided two evaluations of each article. We use a conservative rule that only excludes papers under exclusion criteria that are identified by both models. Next, we automate the process of finding PDFs online, allowing the chatbots to interact with a browser to search for the paper. Each page of the PDF is then evaluated by the tools for relevant information, which is then summarized and relevant quantitative is extracted into a structured format.

> We design the methodology to be configurable for a wide range of uses and apply it here to a collection of 40,000 abstracts on the risks of climate change. Of these, 2,000 papers are identified as being potentially relevant to a study of macroeconomic risks and adaptation potential. We extract results from all papers that can be found online and present a meta-analysis of their results at a national level.

> This process uses advanced AI models to conduct systematic reviews of academic literature. It starts by filtering search results using information in the papers' abstracts, titles, and keywords. We employ two different AI models, OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Gemini’s gemini-1.5-flash, as independent reviewers. Because these models often interpret information in varied ways, they provide two separate evaluations for each article. To ensure accuracy, papers are only excluded if both models agree on the exclusion criteria.

> This methodology is versatile and can be adjusted for different needs. It was applied to a set of 40,000 abstracts focused on climate change risks. From this, 2,000 papers were deemed relevant to studying macroeconomic risks and adaptation potential. We extracted data from the accessible papers and carried out a meta-analysis of the results at a national level.
