> Arturo expressed a lot of interest, and some skepticism, in the CCS model; really likes that it is deep investments, over time; also has questions about how it can scale; he was very intrigued by the idea that a long-term goal is to support community foundations to engage, and to blend national and local/regional philanthropy (who, he said, don't historically do this, and a lot of the megadonors and big foundations are skeptical/distrustful of community foundations in general). He really appreciated that the goal is long-term capacity building and shifting norms about how communities interact with climate policy, which is otherwise very academic.

> He said that it's great to have an initial conversation like we did today, and that many orgs don't ever do this. It makes it much easier for him when he's reviewing LOI's if he has an idea of who represents the org.
> The next opening under environment is in late Feb, and that we can submit 1 or 2 concepts, and that if we do 2 we should consider how they fit together/complement one another.
> ~14% of LOI's are encouraged to apply, and 80% of applications are funded; 40% of funded proposals are not selected during first attempt
> He sees good alignment with our work and their priorities in a few places, but was most interested in the community-centered poliy work/CAB type models that have teeth.
> The "constituences" they are aiming to serve are
> frontline/EJ communities
> States and Cities
> business and finance
> He recommends that to be most competitive we be familiary with what NYCT has been up to recently and said the best way to do this is by looking at the press releases that come out after each board meeting. He recommended going back 3 years.
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can assist in drafting a Letter of Intent (LOI) based on the given insight and catered to the interest of NY Community Trust. Below is a starting point for you:

> Dear Dr. Slutsky,
> 
> **Subject: Letter of Intent for building climate-resilient communities**
> 
> We're writing to you as representatives of our organization, [Your Organization's Name], which is dedicated to designing, adopting, and implementing policies and programs that drive demand for efficient, healthy, and resilient buildings.
> 
> Since our formation, we've leveraged $1.1 billion in federal applications in the last year alone, facilitating state, local, and community applications and priming our own projects. By aligning with 15 Community-Based Organizations, we've commenced crucial groundwork with governmental agencies, providing technical assistance, and fostering groundbreaking climate strategies.
> 
> We are interested in partnering with the New York Community Trust in areas where our missions significantly overlap. Namely, we aim to benefit frontline/Environmental Justice (EJ) communities and improve climate policies within states and cities, while simultaneously engaging businesses and financial stakeholders. 
> 
> Primarily, we require gap funding for Community-Based Organization (CBO) coordination and support. This initiative includes providing technical assistance to state and local implementers, legal and strategy support, and extending support for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). 
> 
> Our overarching goal aligns with that of your trust, bringing about long-term capacity building and shifting norms about how communities interact with climate policy, while scaling our operations and enabling more community foundations to engage with pertinent climate decisions.
> 
> While we are aware that only 14% of LOIs are encouraged to apply, and that 40% of successful applications are not chosen in their first attempt, we believe our work aligns strongly with your current interestsâ€”especially our community-centered policy work.
> 
> Enclosed, you will find further details about our proposal. We appreciate your time and consideration of our intent to apply to the New York Community Trust. We look forward to the opportunity to submit a comprehensive proposal upon your consent.
> 
> Sincerely,

> Please review and amend the LOI as necessary to suit your specific needs and details.

**assistant**:
> The New York Community Trust (NYCT) does not have a fixed amount that they give to each nonprofit that applies for a grant. The funding amount provided to each nonprofit organization can vary based on factors such as the specific project or program being proposed, the organization's budget and capacity, the alignment of the project with NYCT's priorities, and the overall funds available for distribution at that time.
> 
> NYCT evaluates each grant application on its own merit and typically awards grants based on the specific needs and goals outlined in the proposal. It's essential for applicants to clearly articulate their funding requirements, budget justifications, and expected outcomes to increase their chances of receiving a grant from NYCT.
> 
> If you have specific questions about grant amounts or funding criteria, it's recommended to reach out directly to NYCT for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
