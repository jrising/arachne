**assistant**:
> Creating a web page to directly correspond with the audio controls of your car can be quite a complex task, as it involves integrating with your car's hardware and software systems. That said, it might be possible depending on the make and model of your car and the interfaces it supports.
> 
> Most modern cars use either proprietary systems or support platforms like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which are somewhat closed to direct custom interfacing. However, if your car's infotainment system supports certain APIs or has a developer mode, you might be able to develop something custom. Alternatively, some vehicles might allow integration through a combination of an OBD-II device and software that can interact with the vehicle's controls.
> 
> Here’s a general idea of steps you might consider:
> 
> 1. **Research Vehicle Compatibility**: Check if your car supports third-party integrations or if there are any existing APIs or developer modes.
> 
> 2. **Develop the Web Interface**: You'd need a server to host your web page. Create input options that match your car's audio controls.
> 
> 3. **Set Up Communication**: If possible, use Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a physical connection from a phone or a Raspberry Pi-like device to link your web page to the car's system.
> 
> 4. **Vehicle API or Middleware**: Use an API or a middleware that communicates between your web page inputs and the car's audio controls. 
> 
> 5. **Testing and Iteration**: Ensure everything works safely and reliably.
> 
> This is not a straightforward task and would require some technical expertise in web development, networking, and potentially automotive electronics. Always prioritize safety and avoid setups that could distract you while driving. Would you like more specific advice or resources on any of these aspects?

> I'm just interested in the Ford and backward option which seems to work with non-custom apps
**assistant**:
> If you’re just looking to create a simple web-based interface for the forward and backward audio controls that would work in a non-custom app environment, here's a basic outline of how you could approach it:
> 
> 1. **Web Development Basics**: Familiarize yourself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple web page.
> 
> 2. **User Interface**: Create buttons for "Forward" and "Backward." This can be done using simple HTML:
> 
>    ```html
>    <button id="forward">Forward</button>
>    <button id="backward">Backward</button>
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Event Handling**: Use JavaScript to handle button clicks. For instance:
> 
>    ```javascript
>    document.getElementById("forward").addEventListener("click", function() {
>        // Code to send command to car to skip forward
>    });
> 
>    document.getElementById("backward").addEventListener("click", function() {
>        // Code to send command to car to skip backward
>    });
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Communication Protocol**: If your car supports Bluetooth or is connected to your mobile device, you may need to leverage protocols like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or App APIs from the manufacturer's mobile app.
> 
> 5. **Testing with an Existing App**: Use test commands to ensure your commands function properly. You may need to research how the existing Ford Sync system accepts audio commands, as it may allow interaction through voice commands or app integrations.
> 
> 6. **Deployment**: Host your web page online, ensuring your mobile device can access it while connected to the car.
> 
> 7. **Safety**: Always keep safety in mind and test in a controlled environment.
> 
> If you need help with specific coding or resources on connecting to the car’s system, just let me know!
