> What is the country for ISO code CYN?
**assistant**:
> As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there is no ISO code "CYN" for any country. ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are three-letter country codes defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to represent countries and dependent territories. It is possible that the code you provided is incorrect or has been changed since my last update. You can check the most recent list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes on the ISO official website or other reputable sources for the latest information.
