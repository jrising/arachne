> I got some chicken sausage. I'd like my son, who likes very plain things, to try it. How should I prepare it?
**assistant**:
> Since your son enjoys simplicity, I would recommend preparing the chicken sausage in a straightforward manner to make its unique flavor the star of the dish. Here's a simple, savory recipe for pan-cooked chicken sausage:
> 
> **INGREDIENTS**
> 1. Chicken sausage links
> 2. Olive oil
> 
> **INSTRUCTIONS**
> 1. Preheat a non-stick skillet on medium for about 3 minutes.
> 2. Add a small drizzle of olive oil to the pan. You don't need a lot because the sausage links will release some oil as well.
> 3. Carefully add the chicken sausages to the skillet with a pair of tongs or a spatula.
> 4. Cook sausages for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally until all sides are nicely browned and sausage is cooked through.
> 5. Cut into a thick slice to make sure it's fully cooked â€“ no pink should be showing.
> 6. Once it's done, remove the sausages from the pan and let them rest on a paper towel to soak up any excess oil.
> 7. Cut them into little pieces that your son can easily handle, and serve warm.
> 
> Remember: The key to cooking a perfect chicken sausage lies in slowly cooking it on medium heat. Cooking too fast can cause the casing to burst and the sausage to become too dry. Enjoy your meal!
