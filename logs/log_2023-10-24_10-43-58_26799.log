> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> My name is Hannah Blanco, and I am currently a senior at Ursinus College. I am an environmental studies major with minors in marine science, biology, and French. I am hoping to start my graduate career in the Fall of 2024.  
> 
> I have experience working in an aquarium where most of my time was spent answering guests’ questions as well as giving educational talks. Because of our small staff, we had to work together, rotating responsibilities to make sure all work was fairly spread. This teambuilding experience will be helpful when joining a lab as lab work is incredibly collaborative and only successful when each member is encouraged and supported by one another. Science communication is something I am very passionate about and getting to talk to children and adults about climate issues and marine biology was an eye-opening experience. While not marine focused, I, along with three other students created, planned, designed, and planted a rain garden on my college campus in an area that was prone to flooding. Through the summer I remained on campus, pruning, treating pests, and adding additional plants as needed. This project taught me important leadership skills as well as the chance to conceive of, organize, and maintain a physical garden almost entirely on my own. I plan to continue my work with this garden through my senior year and hope it can serve as a place of learning for students in the future. Because of the size of my institution and the newness of the marine science program, I had very limited access to relevant research, but I was still able to take some amazing classes that have prepared me well. Marine Mammals, Biological Oceanography, and Marine Invertebrate Zoology have prepared me with a solid understanding of taxonomy, biology, and evolutionary theory. Environmental Issues in Oceanography and Global Climate change have given me a strong understanding of physical systems that interact with the oceans as well as how they are being altered due to the changing climate.  
> 
> I am particularly passionate about marine organisms and their conservation. There are so many unique and important species in our oceans that are all affected in different ways by the changing climate. I am also very interested in marine ecology, understanding how different species interact with each other, as well as how humans interact with and affect marine creatures. I believe that we must include ourselves when considering the ecology of an environment and that thinking of humans as “other” or separate from the natural world is incredibly harmful. While I am not particularly well versed in economics, I care deeply about local fisheries and working with them to make their livelihoods more sustainable. Your work with stakeholders is particularly interesting to me. Areas like the East Coast of the US that are so tied with the ocean both culturally and economically are my area of interest. Being able to quantify how climate change is affecting these communities is an important step in getting the world to see just how much trouble we are in. 
> 
> 
> Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume and unofficial transcripts as well as a writing sample. I would love the opportunity to chat with you further about potential opportunities as a graduate student in your research group.

**assistant**:
> From the email, it's evident that Hannah Blanco is passionate about marine biology and conservation, with evidence of previous practical experience in this field. However, they have mentioned they aren't familiar with economics. This might rule out the Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters), since the program is heavily concentrated on economics. Also, they haven't specifically mentioned a strong quantitative background, which may tip them away from the preferred program - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. 
> 
> Hannah's interests and background seem to align more with the Masters in Marine Policy. However, this program has transitioned to the new Environmental Science & Management program (ESM) with a Marine track, which might be beneficial for Hannah to explore. They have also displayed a keen interest in human-marine interaction, which might potentially be studied more in the Ph.D. in Marine Policy, which is described as being good for non-traditional students. 
> 
> With respect to the natural science programs offered by the Marine Science & Policy school, Hannah might find these relevant to their interests as well. However, this would mean a suggestion for them to reach out to Xinfeng Liang.
> 
> Hannah didn't mention any schoolwork at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, UD, or indicate that they are local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area.

> Dear Hannah,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. From your background and interests, it seems you would be a good candidate for our Environmental Science & Management program (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/), which has a specific track for Marine studies. This is a transition from our earlier Masters in Marine Policy program, and it maintains a focus on marine environments while offering broader interdisciplinary opportunities.
> 
> That said, our Ph.D. in Marine Policy could potentially align with your interests, especially if you're keen on exploring the socio-ecological complexities of marine ecology and conservation as well as working with stakeholders in coastal regions.
> 
> Kindly note that funding is mostly limited for these programs. However, if you are interested in the field of climate change risks, food systems, interdisciplinary quantitative modeling, or something related to my research, I would encourage you to mention this in your statement of purpose. This could enhance possibilities for funding.
> 
> I recommend you apply by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funds. Should you find yourself drawn more towards the natural science aspects of marine studies, you might want to reach out to my colleague, Xinfeng Liang (xfliang@udel.edu), who could guide you regarding the science programs in our school.
> 
> Again, thank you for your interest in our programs and for considering us for your graduate studies.
