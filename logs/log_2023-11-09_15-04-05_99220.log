> Do you know how much tourism of coral in the florida keys is ecotourism?
**assistant**:
> I'm sorry, but as of my last update in September 2021, I don't possess real-time data or the ability to browse the internet for up-to-date information. However, the Florida Keys have long been a hub for ecotourism, particularly regarding its coral reefs, mainly through snorkeling, scuba diving and fishing excursions. As of my latest available data, a significant portion of the tourism in the Florida Keys was associated with such activities. 
> 
> For the most timely and accurate information, I recommend checking the latest studies, the official websites of the Florida Keys tourism department or resources from ecotourism focused organizations.
