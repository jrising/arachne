> The term you're looking for is "paradigm shift." A paradigm shift refers to a fundamental change in approach, perspective, or underlying assumptions, making the future qualitatively different from the past. In the context of regression models, this implies that the relationships observed in historical data may not accurately represent or capture the dynamics of future situations due to significant changes in influencing factors or the structure of the system being modeled.

> No, I want something more like, "nonlinear". Paradigm shift suggests a difference in how people think about the issue.

> In the context of regression models, the term you may be looking for is "non-stationarity." Non-stationarity refers to a concept in time series analysis where the statistical properties of a system change over time, making the future qualitatively different from the past. This means that regression models fit to historical data may not be suitable for predicting future trends due to changes in the underlying relationships between variables. Non-stationarity can arise from various factors, including technological change, social and political shifts, and natural hazards, among others.
