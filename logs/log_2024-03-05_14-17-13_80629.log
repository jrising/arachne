**user**:
> How do I check to see if any of a list of strings is contained in a given string in python? I want to do my check case-insensitively.
**assistant**:
> You can use built-in Python operations like `any`, `lower`, and `in` for this purpose.
> 
> Here's a sample function that takes a list of substrings and a target string, and checks if any of the substrings are present in the target string:
> 
> ```python
> def contains_any_substring(target, substrings):
>     lower_target = target.lower()
>     lower_substrings = [s.lower() for s in substrings]
>     return any(sub in lower_target for sub in lower_substrings)
> ```
> 
> You use it like so:
> 
> ```python
> substrings = ["Cat", "Dog", "Bird"]
> target = "I have a dog and a snake."
> 
> if contains_any_substring(target, substrings):
>     print("At least one substring is in target.")
> else:
>     print("No substrings are in target.")
> ```
> 
> Remember, this will return `True` as soon as it finds a match, so it doesn't necessarily find all matches if there are multiple.
