> what is the general framing of our corporate strategy and the membership programs at IMT? "With 90% of our time spent inside, itâ€™s critical that our homes, businesses, and community centers are energy efficient and climate resilient. Buildings that we live, work, and play in currently account for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions in low-income communities and communities of color, decreasing quality of life through poor insulation, increased air pollution, high energy bills, and inability to withstand climate disasters.
> 
> To solve this challenge, IMT leverages our technical and policy expertise to empower communities as they advocate for safer housing and lower energy bills; to support governments as they create new, human-centered legislation; and to facilitate climate-conscious business choices that propel corporations to the cutting edge of their industries.
