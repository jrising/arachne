> The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Said another way, using subsets of the indicators would have produced a more accurate or robust result, and as new indicators are added beyond this, the value of the analysis was reduced. Vulnerability is not, as section 2.2.3 suggestions, sector agnostic.

It will be also clearer for me, to distinguish what you would consider desirable or optimal (but perhaps cannot suggest to adopt a different approach at this point in time) and what specific corrective measures you think they could and should implement

> The work performed here to synthesize hazard, exposure, and vulnerability is addressing a significant challenge. While the current synthesis produces sensible results for most impacts, it has notable gaps. Please address the following issues for improvement:
> 
> 1. **Risk Score Methodology**: 
>    The geometric mean risk score is not consistent with other approaches (e.g., the WB’s multiplicative approach, INFORM’s weighted average approach, a fiscal risk approach, or a welfare-based approach). Please re-evaluate the risk scoring methodology to align with widely recognized approaches and ensure consistency in your analysis.
> 
> 2. **Exposure Calculation**:  
>    For exposure, the choice of a geometric mean implies that values will be downward biased. That is, while the rank categories are uniformly distributed, the geometric mean exposure levels are weighted toward lower levels of exposure. Please consider modifying the calculation method to mitigate this downward bias.
> 
> 3. **Vulnerability Indicators**: 
>    The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Please revisit the chosen indicators, considering subsets based on their relevance to each sector, to produce a more accurate or robust result. It is important to recognize that vulnerability is not sector agnostic, as section 2.2.3 suggests.
> 
> 4. **Flooding Impact Assessment**: 
>    The assignment of “low impact” is not consistent for flooding impacts. Please ensure consistency in classification by aligning improved flooding conditions with historically underperforming yields increasing.
> 
> 5. **Cross-Sector Risk Description**: 
>    The use of a geometric mean across sectors is not a justifiable description of actual risk (in fiscal, economic, or social terms). Please revise the methodology to maintain information about the relative and absolute importance of sectors relative to other societal features.
> 
> 6. **Tourism and Agriculture Risk Description**: 
>    If I understand the Tourism results discussion correctly, medium and high-risk counties are those that will experience only small increases in tourism. Like Agriculture, this seems like a poor description of “risk”. Please re-evaluate the criteria for what constitutes risk to better reflect the challenges faced by these sectors.
> 
> 7. **Missing Data Interpretation**: 
>    If I understand the aggregated risk discussion correctly, missing data is interpreted as no risk in the aggregation. Given that this is already a very limited collection of sectors, it seems odd not to just perform the geometric mean over fewer sectors in those regions with missing data. Please adjust how missing data is handled to avoid misrepresenting risk levels for regions with limited data.
