> I am preparing the materials in my tenure packet, particularly the statements for sharing with external letter writers. I have engaged in many grant-writing groups over the years, but many fewer published projects. Should I include this material in my external statements? What about for the internal packet?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it's a good idea to include information about your grant-writing experience in both your external and internal tenure packet materials. This experience demonstrates your ability to collaborate with others, develop project ideas, and secure funding, which are essential skills for a successful academic career.
> 
> For the external statements that will be shared with letter writers, you can mention your participation in grant-writing groups and any successful proposals that resulted from these collaborations. Be sure to emphasize how this experience has informed your research, teaching, and service, and how it has contributed to your development as a scholar.
> 
> For the internal packet, you should provide more details about your grant-writing history, including the number of proposals submitted, the funding agencies targeted, and the amount of funding secured (if applicable). You can also mention any interdisciplinary collaborations or skills gained through these grant applications. This information will help your tenure committee members better understand your professional growth and achievements, and it could strengthen your overall case for tenure.
> 
> Remember that your tenure packet should present a cohesive and compelling narrative of your impact as a scholar, teacher, and member of the academic community. Showcasing your collaborative experiences, like participating in grant-writing groups, can help paint a richer picture of your contributions and potential for future success in your career.
