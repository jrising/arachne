**assistant**:
> Yes, GDP (Gross Domestic Product) numbers are derived from the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SNA is an internationally agreed upon framework that provides comprehensive guidelines for compiling measures of economic activity at a national level. It incorporates various methods and standards to ensure consistency and comparability across different countries. The GDP is one of the key indicators produced within this system, representing the total market value of all goods and services produced in a country over a specified period. If you have any specific questions about how GDP is calculated or its components, feel free to ask!
