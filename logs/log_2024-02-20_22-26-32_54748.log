**user**:
> I just discovered that I have lice. I don't have much time to deal with this now. What should I do?
**assistant**:
> I'm sorry to hear about your lice infestation, James. Here's a quick treatment plan for you:
> 
> 1. **Treat the hair:**
> Purchase over-the-counter lice treatment from a local pharmacy. Follow the instructions on the package. Make sure you complete any recommended repeat treatments, which are typically needed after 7-9 days to kill any newly hatched lice.
> 
> 2. **Comb out the nits:**
> After treatment, thoroughly comb out your hair with a special nit comb to remove lice eggs. This may take time and patience.
> 
> 3. **Check and treat family members:**
> Check other members of your household for lice. If lice are detected, they should also follow the treatment process.
> 
> 4. **Clean household items:**
> Wash and dry bed linens, clothing, and stuffed toys your children may have been in contact with on a hot setting. Vacuum carpets and upholstered furniture. 
> 
> 5. **Repeat:**
> Check your hair daily and keep combing out any nits that you find. If after 8â€“9 days the lice persist, you may want to contact a healthcare provider for prescription treatments.
> 
> Please start with these steps and contact a health provider if needed. Remember, lice are common and treatable and do not indicate a lack of cleanliness. It can happen to anyone.
