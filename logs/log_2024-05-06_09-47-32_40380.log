> I am looking at coffee c prices on yahoo finances, which are listed as being in "USX". I assume those are some kind of US dollars, but are they inflation adjusted?
**assistant**:
> The term "USX" often refers to the currency exchange rate between the United States and another specified country. However, in the context of Yahoo Finance and commodity prices such as coffee, "USX" typically just stands for US currency, or US dollars. 
> 
> That said, these commodity prices are not typically adjusted for inflation. They are reported in nominal terms, showing the market price at the time, not taking into account the general increase or decrease in price levels over time.
> 
> If you want to compare the real value of commodity prices over a long period, you would typically need to manually adjust these nominal figures for inflation using an appropriate inflation index, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
