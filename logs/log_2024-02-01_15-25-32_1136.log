> Conservation
> Artificial Reefs
> Delaware’s marine waters currently host 14 artificially engineered reefs, primarily located within the bay but with additional structures extending into more expansive, oceanic territories. These reefs, fashioned from a variety of materials including cleaned construction components, decommissioned boats, and retired subway cars, have been strategically placed to create new, stable habitats and expand opportunities for recreational fishing and diving. The artificial reef programs actively manage these sites, deploying materials like rocks and concrete to certain locations, such as Delaware Bay Sites 4, 6, and 7 (shown in brown on figure below), and communicating their placement to anglers. This communication is critical, given that the financing for reef development is primarily sourced from angler and boater excise taxes—a key part of federal aid projects. The established reefs offer an enhanced hard bottom habitat, quickly colonized by sessile organisms, expanding food sources, protection of juvenile fish by offering more refuge space, and a potential nucleus for adults to spawn. Consequently, artificial reefs have significantly altered underwater landscapes and ecosystems, with data being collected through diverse methods, including state documentation, communication with state and NOAA representatives, and broader internet-based research.
