> I have two implementations of a dot product, for AVX and SSE, which I don't fully understand. I see that the only difference is a constant, called VECTOR_SIZE, which is 4 for SSE and 8 for AUX. I would like to combine these chunks of code, and ideally extract the correct number from the system. Can I do this?

> The VECTOR_SIZE constant in your code is defining the width of the vectors that the code operates on. SSE registers are 128 bits wide and can thus operate on 4 floats of 32 bits each at a time, hence the VECTOR_SIZE of 4 for SSE. AVX registers, on the other hand, are 256 bits wide and can operate on 8 floats (32 bits each) at a time, hence the VECTOR_SIZE of 8 for AVX.

> When writing the actual computation code, you would ensure that it can work with both VECTOR_SIZE values. For example, if your original code uses SSE intrinsics (_mm_ functions) you will need different code for the AVX case that uses AVX intrinsics (_mm256_ functions).
