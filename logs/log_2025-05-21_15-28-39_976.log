> I think my kids liked when I sang them "Before the Deluge" because they know I work on environmental issues. But it's a bit too fatalistic for my taste. Can you suggest a different environmental protest song for me to learn?

> It's wonderful that you're looking for songs that align with your work and resonate with your kids! How about learning "Big Yellow Taxi" by Joni Mitchell? It's a classic environmental anthem with an upbeat melody that's easy to sing along to. The song addresses themes like urban development and environmental degradation, but it retains a hopeful sense of advocacy, making it a great alternative to something more fatalistic. Let me know if you'd like more details or another suggestion!

> That's a great song, but I'm not sure if it's a good singing song (I don't have music to sing with when I'm putting the kids to bed).

> If you're looking for something that fits well as a lullaby, consider "Blackbird" by The Beatles. While it’s not strictly an environmental protest song, its themes of hope and freedom can resonate with messages of sustainability and renewal. The melody is gentle and soothing, making it perfect for bedtime. Plus, it’s simple enough to sing a cappella. Let me know if you’d like more options!
