> The following is a structured list of research questions. Can you draft a "Research Needs" section of a report on the economic contribution of the coastal area of Delaware to the state? One of the main concerns in the report is the risk to this coastal contribution.
> 
>  - Projected impacts of climate change?
>     - Loss of coastal economy?
>     - Disaster preparedness and potential outcomes
>  - How effective are natural and hybrid systems? (In terms of cost and protection benefits)
>     - Are they cost effective for Delaware in particular?
>         - What are the co-benefits? What is the value of these benefits? Ecosystem services
>         - Do they hold up in larger storms? What is the value of the protection they offer? Especially compared to built infrastructure
>     - Is one better over the other in the context of Delaware?
>         - What is the permitting system like for each type of project? Is this a barrier?
>     - What barriers exist within the US to using natural projects for coastal protection?
>         - How do these barriers influence the selection of which method to use?
>  - Further stories from business owners and residents affected by the flooding
>     - Marian Parrott mentioned several other business owners that have been affected by flooding and might be interested in being interviewed as well

> ## Research Needs
> 
> A thorough understanding of the economic contribution of Delaware's coastal area requires a multi-faceted research approach, particularly considering the impending threat posed by climate change and rising sea levels. In order to properly address the pressing concerns about the coastal economy, it is important to focus on several key research areas:
> 
> **1. Projected impacts of Climate Change**
> 
> Climate change predictions will form the basis of our risk assessment for the coastal areas. Understanding the potential magnitude of sea-level rise, increased storm frequency and intensity, and the subsequent effects on the coastal economy is of utmost importance.
> 
> * Research is needed to quantify the potential loss to Delaware's coastal economy due to climate change, including loss of property, revenue, and jobs.
> 
> * Further investigation is required into Delaware's disaster preparedness and potential outcomes in the event of increased climate change-induced incidents. This research should include an examination of current plans, their adequacy, and potential gaps that need to be addressed.
> 
> **2. Effectiveness of Natural and Hybrid Systems**
> 
> Understanding the role and effectiveness of natural and hybrid systems in mitigating coastal risks will help inform policy decisions.
> 
> * Comparative studies on the cost-effectiveness of natural versus hybrid systems specifically tailored for Delaware's coastal characteristics are needed. 
> 
> * An assessment of co-benefits and value of these systems, such as ecosystem services, should be performed. This would also include an evaluation of their resilience in larger storms and their potential protective value compared to built infrastructure.
> 
> * Research is needed to compare the relative advantages of natural and hybrid systems in the context of Delaware's unique conditions.
> 
> * The permitting process for each type of project should be reviewed to understand if it presents any barriers to implementation.
> 
> **3. Barriers to Implementing Natural Projects for Coastal Protection**
> 
> Understanding the challenges to implementing natural projects in the United States could inform local decision-making.
> 
> * A comprehensive review of barriers at the local, state, and national level is required to understand the factors influencing the selection of different protection methods.
> 
> **4. Personal Stories from Affected Residents and Businesses**
> 
> Collecting qualitative data from individuals directly impacted by coastal flooding will provide a human perspective to the economic figures and policy analyses.
> 
> * Interviews with business owners, such as Marian Parrott and others who have expressed interest, could provide deeper insights into the impact of flooding on coastal businesses.
> 
> * Collection of narratives from residents affected by the flooding can shed light on the personal economic and emotional tolls of these events.
> 
> Investigating these research needs will provide a more complete understanding of the economic contribution of Delaware's coastal area and the risks it faces due to climate change. This will help guide strategic planning and policy development to protect and preserve this valuable asset.
