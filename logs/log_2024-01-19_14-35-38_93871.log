**assistant**:
> To cite a direct quote with a page number using the American Psychological Association (APA) style, you would write it like this:
> 
> Brady and Marsh (2013, p. #) note, "From a modeling perspective perennial crop planting decisions may have more in common with housing and manufacturing than with annual row crop production."
> 
> Remember to replace the "#" with the actual page number. This reference style is common in the social sciences. 
> 
> If you're writing in a style that uses footnotes, such as Chicago, you would include the page number in the footnote. The inline citation would look like: 
> 
> As Brady and Marsh note, “From a modeling perspective, perennial crop planting decisions may have more in common with housing and manufacturing than with annual row crop production.”^1
> 
> And the footnote would provide the full citation including page number: 
> 
> ^1 Brady and Marsh, *Title of Their Work* (Location: Publisher, 2013), p. #.
> 
> Again, replace "#" with the actual page number. It's always important to check the specific citation style you're using, as different fields have different standards.
