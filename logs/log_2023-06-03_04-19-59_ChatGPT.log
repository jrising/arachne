> What is La Fontaine's story of the cat and the rat involving a net and an owl and a weasel, told as a simple story for a 3 year old?
**assistant**:
> Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a clever cat, a tiny rat, a wise owl, and a quick weasel.
> 
> The clever cat was the king of the forest, but he had a problem. The tiny rat always managed to sneak into his house and steal his food. The cat was upset and wanted to catch the rat. So, he came up with a plan. He found a big net and set it up as a trap near his house, hoping to catch the mischievous rat.
> 
> One day, as the tiny rat was making his usual trip to the cat's house, he noticed the net. The rat was smart and knew it was a trap. But just as he was about to turn back, he spotted a chunk of cheese inside the net. The rat loved cheese! 
> 
> Suddenly, he had an idea. He ran to find the quick weasel. The rat told the weasel about the cheese and asked him for help. The weasel was faster and smaller, and he liked challenges. So, he decided to help the rat.
> 
> With a swift dash, the weasel got into the net, grabbed the cheese, and ran out, all before the cat could even blink. But just as they were celebrating, the wise owl, who had been watching everything from his tree, flew down.
> 
> The owl looked at the rat and the weasel and said, "You may have outsmarted the cat today, but remember, every day is a new challenge. Always think before you act."
> 
> The rat and the weasel thanked the owl for his advice. From that day on, they worked together to stay out of trouble, always thinking before they acted, just like the wise owl told them.
> 
> And that's the end of our story, little one. It shows us that it's always good to be clever, but it's even better to be wise and think before we act.
