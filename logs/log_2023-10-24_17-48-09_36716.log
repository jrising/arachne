> I am confident in applying for the doctoral programme in Marine Policy at SCHOOL OF MARINE SCIENCE & POLICY at The College of Earth, Ocean and Environment (CEOE) at The University of Delaware. I am keenly interested in the area and seek to leverage my experience within this field, and I have the utmost respect for your prominent academic achievements and extraordinary contributions. My CV and transcripts of both undergraduate and graduate modules are attached to the application for your kind consideration.
> 
> Being a dedicated and diligent young man, I have a natural science background, relevant research experience in shipping emissions modeling and environmental impact monetizing, and skills of chemistry lab, programming (MATLAB, Python), and mathematic modeling. I believe I can make due contributions to the doctoral program and I look forward to becoming part of your world-renowned team to participate in the PhD research.

**assistant**:
> Dear Lingze Meng,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your background in Marine Chemistry and your research experience in shipping emissions modeling and environmental impact monetizing certainly make you an interesting candidate for our doctoral program in Marine Policy at the School of Marine Science & Policy, UDel. This program is particularly good for non-traditional students or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds, such as yourself, given your natural science background.
> 
> Given your specific research interests and your programming skills, you might be well-suited to work on some of the climate change risks and food systems modeling projects that I work on. I encourage you to mention in your statement of purpose how your work might align with these project areas.
> 
> However, please keep in mind that funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students, especially for the Ph.D. programs. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds.
