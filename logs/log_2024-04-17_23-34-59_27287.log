> What is the name of the French(?) painting style that generally shows groups of people in naked repose in beautiful outdoor settings. I think it may translate to "the good life".
**assistant**:
> The French painting style you're referring to is called "Fête Galante". This form of art was popular during the Rococo period, categorizing works that depict the aristocracy enjoying outdoor activities such as concerts, picnics, or dances. The term translates loosely to "gallant party".
> 
> Although "Fête Galante" paintings often depict idyllic scenes of the high society in beautiful, bucolic settings, they don't typically feature nude figures. Instead, figures are generally well-dressed in elegant attire.
> 
> It's worth noting that the phrase "the good life" can be translated to "La vie bonne" in French, but it does not specifically refer to a painting style as such.
