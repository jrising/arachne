> What is Plato's concept of dianoia?
**assistant**:
> Plato's concept of dianoia, also translated as "thought" or "intellect," refers to the faculty of the human soul responsible for reasoning and contemplation. It is one of the three parts of the soul that Plato describes in his philosophy, along with thymos (emotion or spiritedness) and epithymia (desire). 
> 
> According to Plato, dianoia is the highest and most refined part of the soul. It is the faculty that enables us to understand abstract concepts, engage in logical thinking, and contemplate the eternal and unchanging Forms, or abstract universal ideals. It is through dianoia that we are able to engage in philosophical inquiry and seek truth and wisdom.
> 
> Plato believed that dianoia was essential for leading a virtuous and fulfilling life. He believed that by cultivating the faculties of dianoia and thymos, individuals could achieve a state of balance and harmony within themselves and in their relationships with others.
