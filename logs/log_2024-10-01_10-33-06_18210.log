Stakeholders often have useful insights on emerging sources of data, but our stakeholder interview process was very limited.

> 1. **Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and Global Challenges**
> 
>     Marine spatial planning (MSP) offers a structured approach to organizing human activities in marine environments. In Delaware, as with many parts of the world, MSP faces significant challenges due to data gaps. This reflects a broader issue in global MSP efforts: the lack of comprehensive, high-resolution data that hinders effective planning and management. Addressing these data gaps can significantly enhance MSP processes by providing a clear understanding of marine environments, which is crucial for integrating ecological, economic, and social dimensions. By improving data collection and accessibility, MSP can become a more powerful tool for sustainable ocean governance worldwide, enabling planners to make informed decisions that balance diverse interests and needs.

> 2. **Effective Use of Data in MSP**
> 
>     While MSP holds great promise for ocean management, its effectiveness is only as strong as the data it relies upon. In this paper, we identified various data categories—physical, biological, usage, outcome, management, and planning data—essential for understanding the complexities of marine systems. However, obtaining high-quality, up-to-date spatial data, especially in remote marine regions, remains a significant challenge due to the costs and technical difficulties of collecting such information. This underscores the importance of identifying data gaps both spatially and temporally. High-resolution data across all these areas are necessary for successful MSP implementation. Current limitations in data precision, particularly in offshore regions, highlight areas needing improvement.
> 
> 3. **Interdisciplinary Approach for MSP**
> 
>     Implementing MSP effectively requires an interdisciplinary approach that acknowledges the intricate connections between physical, biological, and economic systems. By integrating natural and social data, this approach can improve data precision and reliability, ultimately leading to better decision-making. For example, combining insights from remote sensing and AIS with emerging techniques like eDNA can offer a more complete picture of marine ecosystems. However, transforming disparate data into actionable information necessitates new analytical methods, such as reanalysis or machine learning, promoting a holistic view of the coupled human-natural systems in marine environments.
> 
> 4. **Broader Impacts of Closing Data Gaps**
> 
>     Addressing marine data gaps can have profound implications for policy and practice in MSP, particularly in mitigating conflicts between diverse marine activities. By ensuring that MSP processes are informed by comprehensive data, policymakers can more effectively balance the competing interests of industries such as fishing, shipping, and conservation. Moreover, involving local communities and stakeholders in the MSP process is critical. Their engagement helps incorporate diverse perspectives and ensures that management strategies reflect the needs and priorities of those most affected by marine policies. Ultimately, closing data gaps not only supports more equitable and effective marine governance but also contributes to healthier marine ecosystems. This, in turn, enhances ecosystem services that are vital for human well-being, promoting sustainable use of ocean resources for future generations.
