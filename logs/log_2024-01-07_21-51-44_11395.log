**user**:
> Tikiwiki has a database update system, where there is a folder of a bunch of sql files and the system seems to know about which have executed successfully. But now that I've fixed a bunch of errors, this is out of sync. The system wants to still run certain files, but I've already made those changes. How can I tell it to acknowledge those files?
**assistant**:
> The TikiWiki architecture stores information about the database schema in a specific table in the database itself (usually named something like `tiki-schema`). This table tracks the versions of each update file that has been successfully run. 
> 
> Check the status of executed SQL files by looking at this table. Either through PHPMyAdmin or using a SQL command:
> 
> ```sql
> SELECT * FROM tiki_schema;
> ```
> 
> Here, you would see something like:
> 
> ```
> +---------------------+-------+
> | filename            | lastModif |
> +---------------------+-------+
> | 20191003_upgrade.sql| 20191003 |
> ```
> 
> If you've manually performed the updates from certain SQL files, you should manually update the `tiki-schema` table with the respective file names and modification timestamps (which you can usually see in the file name itself). 
> 
> For example, to acknowledge execution of a sql upgrade file named `20231001_myupdate.sql`, use:
> ```sql
> INSERT INTO `tiki_schema` (`filename`, `lastModif`) VALUES ('20231001_myupdate.sql', '20231001');
> ```
> or to update a current entry:
> ```sql
> UPDATE `tiki_schema` set `lastModif` = '20231001' WHERE `filename`= '20231001_myupdate.sql';
> ```
> 
> Please replace `'20231001_myupdate.sql'` and `'20231001'` with actual file name you want to acknowledge and its timestamp, respectively.  
> 
> Before executing these commands, be sure to backup the database and ensure the updates were successful to avoid any unintended side effects of manually adjusting these version schemas.
