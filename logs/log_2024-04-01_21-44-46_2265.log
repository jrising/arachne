> 
>  The following are comments that I have made on other sections of the assessment:
> ===
> 	I think that there is a lack of broad integration across the chapters, which may be addressed in a Conclusion chapter. While individual chapters discuss overlap and interactions, we do are not given an assessment of (1) how these interactions result in new or changed risks, and (2) how all of the sectors combine to shape our experience or welfare in the future.
> 	Each chapter is defined by the sectors that can be quantified, rather than a general explanation of what the sector is. Such an explanation would also support a discussion of which impacts should be included, even if they have not been studied qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, what are all of the agricultural outputs of New York, so we can understand what portion has been captured in the 6 field crops and 3 perennial crops? A discussion of the risks missing from each sector is needed.
> Pg. ES-4	Figure ES-3 refers to “Extreme Temperature impacts”, by which I believe are meant “Extreme Temperature Mortality and Morbidity”. This may also explain the asterisk next to “Human Health and Safety”, which appears to not have further details.
> Pg. ES-4	The lower panel of ES-3 is not conducive to comparison with the upper panel. Either a second bar, showing the total of the top panel, or a stacked bar to the total economic impact, would improve communication. In particular, I believe that it would show that near-century mortality losses and century-long SSP2-45 mortality impacts are less than the total of other sectors.
> Ch. 3, Table 3-3	The baseline column presumably describes the value of production in the baseline period, but then the climate losses are reported as greater than this whole production.
> Ch. 3, Table 3-4	This appears to be identical to Table 3-3.
> Ch. 3, Figure 3-1	The confidence intervals are overlaid, so that it is not clear which applies to which scenario.
> Ch. 4, lines 356 - 357	Recreational fishing expenditures represent a transfer, and the loss of that transfer does not correspond to an economic loss. If the money is saved, it could result in an increase in wealth.
> Ch. 4, Table 4-9, Figure 4-5	Coldwater losses are shown to be less than $10 million in every region, but Table 4-9 shows several regions with losses greater than $10 million.
> Ch. 4, Table 4-10, Figure 4-5	SSP 2-45 shows greater losses for all fisheries than SSP 5-85 in several counties in Figure 4-5, but this is not reflected in Table 4-10, where SSP5-85 is almost invariably worse.

> 577 Impacts of Climate Change on Electricity Demand
> 578 Within this section, the impacts of climate change-driven changes in temperature on electricity
> 579 demand are separated into: (1) the impacts on annual electricity demand as a result of changes in
> 580 average CDD and HDD, and (2) the impacts on peak electricity demand as a result of changes in
> 581 seasonal minimum and maximum temperatures.
> 582 Annual Electricity Demand
> 583 In the Reference Case, the amount of heating service demand supplied by electricity remains
> 584 relatively low throughout the forecast horizon, due to minimal adoption of heat pumps, with
> 585 efficiency gains and stock turnover of aging electric resistance equipment leading to declines in
> 586 total demand for electric heating relative to today’s levels. The relatively low amount of electric
> 587 heating demand in the Reference Case is further lowered when comparing the Moderate
> 588 Reference and Severe Reference cases to the Mild Reference case, as increases in winter
> 589 temperatures lead to declines in HDD and associated electric load.
> 590 The amount of cooling service demand gradually increases in the Mild Reference case, in part
> 591 because it is assumed that New York State reaches full saturation of air conditioning equipment,
> 592 and because the Mild case includes increases in cooling degree days as a result of climate change.
> 593 However, the Moderate Reference and Severe Reference cases experience much sharper
> 594 increases in CDD, with cooling demand in the Severe case reaching 2x that of the Mild in 2050
> 595 and 3.6x in 2100.
> 596 In the Decarbonization Scenario, heating service demand grows sharply over the next few
> 597 decades, as electrifying heating needs in residential and commercial buildings is a key pillar to
> 598 achieve the State’s climate targets. Space heating demand increases from 20 TWh in 2020 to 31
> 599 TWh in 2050 in the Mild Scenario. Energy efficiency measures, such as upgrades to building
> 600 shells, are also critical to managing the impacts of electrification on system demand, and the
> 601 Decarbonization Scenario reflects deep investments in building shells in residential and
> 602 commercial buildings; in the absence of these investments the increase in space heating demand
> 603 would be much larger. However, in the Severe climate scenario, heating demand stays
> 604 approximately close to today’s level of 20 TWh through mid-century and reduces further beyond
> 605 it. This is a result of warming of winter temperatures outweighing the significant increase in the
> 606 number of homes and businesses meeting their heating needs with electricity.
>  Cross-Sectoral Economic Impact Analysis of Climate Change in New York State
>  Draft Economic Impact Report 6-30
>  607 The heat pumps installed provide more efficient forms of cooling than conventional air
> 608 conditioning units. As a result of heat pump installations coupled with investments in building
> 609 shells and other energy efficiency measures, cooling demand grows more slowly in the
> 610 Decarbonization Scenario than in the Reference Case. In the Decarbonization Scenario in 2100,
> 611 space cooling demand ranges from 10 to 36 TWh across the climate scenarios whereas in the
> 612 Reference Scenario, it ranges from 15 to 54 TWh.
> 613 The total demand is higher in the Decarbonization scenario relative to Reference Case given the
> 614 higher amount of electrification of different end-uses, including transportation and industry,
> 615 assumed in the former. Total demand in the Reference scenario increases with increasing cooling
> 616 demand driven by warming. In the Decarbonization scenario, increase in cooling demand is offset
> 617 by decrease in electrified heating demand leading to the total demand not changing significantly.
> 618 By 2100 the total demand in the Reference Case ranges from 211-244 TWh and that in the
> 619 Decarbonization Scenario ranges from 357 to 361 TWh.
> 620 Despite the additional electric heating demand introduced in the Decarbonization Scenario by
> 621 2100, the total space cooling and heating demand in the Reference Case is 5 TWh higher than
> 622 that in the Decarbonization Scenario in the Severe scenario. In other words, in the later period
> 623 and in the presence of Severe climate change, less electricity is needed to meet the heating and
> 624 cooling load of the nearly 92% of buildings that install a heat pump than the energy expended to
> 625 heat and cool the less efficient building stock in the Reference Case with only 3% of buildings with
> 626 heat pumps. This again highlights the value of energy efficient heat pumps and building shell
> 627 improvements in the Decarbonization scenario, which limit the increase in cooling demand
> 628 relative to the Reference Case in which those measures are not adopted.

>  648 and the impacts of climate change will place additional stress on summer peak demands over the
> 649 forecast horizon. By the 2080s, severe climate change could drive up to a 10 GW difference in
> 650 summer peaks relative to a more mild climate change scenario. Despite the cooling demand
> 651 increasing by a higher amount in the Reference Case, as shown in Figure 6-15, the total summer
> 652 peak is generally lower than that in the Decarbonization Scenario given the contribution of other
> 653 electrified end-uses (e.g. light-duty vehicles) included in the latter. The exception to that is the
> 654 Severe Scenario, where the increase in space cooling demand, driven by lower efficiency ACs and
> 655 the absence of other energy efficiency investments, is greater than demand growth driven by
> 656 other electrified end-uses. This leads to a summer peak of 50 GW and 55 GW in the Reference
> 657 scenario in 2080 and 2100, which is approximately 2 GW higher than the peaks in the
> 658 Decarbonization Scenario in each respective year.
> 659 In the Decarbonization Scenario, under the Mild scenario, New York’s electricity system becomes
> 660 winter-peaking by the mid-2030s as a result of the electrification of heating demand. By 2050, if
> 661 winter extreme temperatures are relatively unaffected by climate change, as modeled in the Mild
> 662 scenario, winter peaks are projected to reach about 47 GW.
> 663 However, in the severe climate scenario, winter extreme temperatures become significantly
> 664 warmer due to climate change, leading to declines in winter peak demand even as the number of
> 665 buildings being heated by electricity remains the same. At the same time, summer extreme
> 666 temperatures increase, leading to the Severe Decarbonization scenario becoming a dual-peaking
> 667 system by 2050, and returning to a summer-peaking system in the 2080s.
> 668 In the Reference case, the annual peak is 46 GW and 55 GW in 2100 in the Moderate and Severe
> 669 Climate scenarios respectively. It is very comparable to the annual peaks of 48 GW and 53 GW in
> 670 the Decarbonization scenario in each corresponding climate scenario. Given the low heating
> 671 electrification and low winter peak in the Reference Case, additional capacity is needed to simply
> 672 meet the high cooling demand driven by less efficient ACs and lack of other energy efficiency
> 673 measures described above. The Decarbonization scenario involves aggressive electrification of
> 674 both heating and cooling, among other end-uses and investments in energy efficiency, which
> 675 leads the system to a similar peak demand outcome as the Reference in the long run. However,
> 676 the Decarbonization Scenario results in more “efficient” utilization of generation and
> 677 transmission infrastructure because this infrastructure is leveraged to support both summer and
> 678 winter peak demand. Additionally, while both cases require incremental investment to meet a

> 689 higher than the projected peak due to higher than expected summer temperatures. The planning
> 690 reserve margin, or PRM, has in recent years been set at around 10 percent on a UCAP basis.19
> 691 The analysis performed in this assessment finds a similar target PRM in the Mild Reference Case,

> 693 the reserve margin increases in the Moderate and Severe Reference Case accordingly. However,
> 694 when examining the Decarbonization Scenario, our assessment in RECAP indicates that
> 695 interannual variability between winter peak temperatures is considerably greater. As a result,
> 696 when determining the amount of resources that would be required above “median” peak winter
> 697 conditions, a higher reserve margin is needed in the Mild Decarbonization Scenario of about 18%.
> 698 The reserve margin requirements as a percentage of peak load decline in the Moderate and

> 740 Decarbonization Scenario Portfolios

> 743 the mid-2030s in the Mild Decarbonization scenario. However, under each climate scenario,
> 744 increased warming leads to both a decrease in winter heating demand and a significant increase

> 746 significant declines in overall peak load compared to the Mild Decarbonization scenario. As a
> 747 result, the primary drivers of changes in the resource portfolio driven by climate change are: (1)
> 748 declines in system reserve margin requirements which lead to a lower build-out of zero-carbon
> 749 firm capacity and battery storage, and (2) changes in the timing of demand from winter to
> 750 summer, that leads to more solar being cost optimal and less wind. In the Moderate
> 751 Decarbonization Scenario, the primary shift occurs in the build-out of firm capacity and battery
> 752 storage, with nearly 7 GW less zero-carbon firm capacity and 2 GW less battery storage by 2100,
> 753 and impacts on the renewable resource mix are negligible relative to the Mild Decarbonization
> 754 Scenario. In the Severe Decarbonization Scenario, there is a smaller decline in reserve margin
> 755 requirements by 2100 relative to the Mild because of significant increases in summer peak
> 756 demand, and as a result there is a decline of 4 GW of zero-carbon firm capacity by 2100 relative

> 782 In the Decarbonization Scenario, the impacts of climate change on total electricity system costs

> 788 As a result, declines in the build-out of zero-carbon firm capacity and battery storage lead to

> 790 Decarbonization Scenario vary in direction between periods and are primarily driven by whether
> 791 the system is summer or winter-peaking in a given period. Through 2030, annual costs increase as
> 792 a result of rising summer temperatures in both the Moderate and Severe Decarbonization
> 793 Scenarios. In the medium-term through 2050, annual costs decrease because the system is
> 794 winter-peaking and the reduction in winter peak demand leads to net declines in cost. In the
> 795 Moderate Decarbonization Scenario, the system remains winter-peaking past 2050 and becomes
> 796 dual-peaking by 2100, and as a result continued increases in winter temperatures and
> 797 corresponding reductions in aggregate system needs lead to continued declines in cost. In the

> 839 This analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of known temperature impacts on the bulk
> 840 electricity system; however, there are many climate-driven events that are not captured, such as
> 841 sea level rise and increased frequency and magnitude of storms, that will have an impact on
> 842 electric infrastructure in New York State. This will result in a combination of increased hardening
> 843 costs to improve the resilience of the energy system and/or increased costs associated with
> 844 damage from these climate-driven events. Additionally, the impacts of rising temperatures on the
> 845 distribution system were not considered in this assessment. There are also several climate
> 846 impacts that are currently highly uncertain and as a result are not modeled, but may be the
> 847 subject of future exploration.
> 848 Additionally, the analysis provides a projection of the impacts of climate change through 2100;
> 849 however, this includes a projection of least-cost resource portfolios when the costs of many
> 850 technologies and fuels are highly uncertain and for simplicity are held static after 2050.

> Can you provide any relevant comments, along the lines of the ones I offer on other sections above?
**assistant**:
> Given your previous insightful comments on other sections of the assessment, we can apply a similar level of scrutiny to the energy supply and demand section. Here are some comments and suggestions that might help enhance clarity, integration, and comprehensiveness of this section:
> 
> 1. **Integration and Cross-Reference with Other Sections**: 
>     - There seems to be a significant amount of detail on the impacts of electrification and climate change on New York's energy demand, yet it might be beneficial to explicitly integrate and reference findings from other sectors, particularly transportation and industrial sectors, which are mentioned to have a higher amount of electrification in the Decarbonization Scenario. This would ensure a cohesive narrative across the report. 
>     - The limitations section does well to highlight areas not captured by the analysis. However, suggesting potential intersections with other chapters that deal with those limitations (e.g., a chapter discussing the impacts of sea level rise on infrastructure) could reinforce the need for a comprehensive approach to climate adaptation and mitigation.
> 
> 2. **Clarity and Accessibility of Figures and Tables**:
>     - Figures 6-12, 6-13, and 6-14: It would be useful to ensure that these figures are as accessible as possible by including clearer legends, possibly simplifying the data presentation for a more intuitive comprehension. For example, using comparative bar or line graphs that directly contrast the scenarios could make it easier for readers to grasp the differences at a glance.
>     - Table 6-9 and Figure 6-15: Similar to previous sections, improving these to more clearly showcase the comparison between reference and decarbonization scenarios over time under different climate projections would provide clearer communication. A graphical representation of Table 6-9 could further enhance understanding.
> 
> 3. **Comprehensive Explanation of Sectoral Definitions and Integration**:
>     - Similar to your previous feedback, defining key terms and the scope of the "energy supply and demand" sector more carefully could enhance readers' understanding. Specifically, explaining the assumptions around "decarbonization scenario" and "reference case" more thoroughly within the context of this section could prevent confusion.
>     - A more detailed discussion of how the sectoral changes (e.g., electrification in transportation and industry) are interconnected and impact overall energy demand and system reliability could provide a clearer picture of the cumulative effects of climate change and mitigation efforts across New York’s economy.
> 
> 4. **Discussion of Missing Risks and Uncertainties**:
>     - The limitations paragraph is a good start but expanding on the potential economic and reliability impacts of those uncaptured risks (e.g., increased frequency of storms, sea level rise) could provide a more rounded picture. Additionally, discussing the uncertainties around technology costs and availability post-2050 in more detail could strengthen the report.
>     - A discussion on the socio-economic implications of the shift towards more electrification (e.g., job transitions, energy poverty) and how this might vary under different climate scenarios could further enrich the analysis.
> 
> 5. **Suggestions for Enhanced Comparisons**:
>     - Given the substantial effect of climate change scenarios on New York's energy system, offering clearer, direct comparisons between scenarios (e.g., how each scenario precisely impacts peak demand, system costs, and electrification levels) could make the results more intuitive. Graphical tools such as side-by-side comparison charts or spider charts could be particularly effective here.
> 
> Overall, emphasizing clearer integration and cross-referencing between sectors, enhancing the clarity and accessibility of visual data representations, and providing a more comprehensive view of how climate scenarios interaction with electrification and other transitions across sectors could significantly improve the report's ability to communicate its findings effectively.
