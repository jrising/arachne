> Where do these gift traditions come from?
**assistant**:
> The origins of these traditional anniversary gift themes are not well-documented and there is no one definitive answer as to where they come from. Some sources suggest that the tradition of giving certain materials as gifts on specific anniversaries dates back to medieval Europe, while others claim that the tradition originated in the United States in the early 20th century.
> 
> One theory is that the traditional gift themes for each anniversary were established as a way to mark the passage of time and to celebrate the growing commitment and longevity of a couple's relationship. The materials associated with each anniversary are often symbolic of the strength and durability of the relationship, as well as the changes and growth that have occurred over time.
> 
> It's also possible that the traditional gift themes were simply created as a way to give people ideas for what to give as gifts on specific anniversaries. Ultimately, the importance of these traditional gift themes lies in the sentiment behind them, and the significance they hold for the couple celebrating the anniversary.

> What is the difference between "in press", "accepted", and the like?
**assistant**:
> In academic publishing, the terms "in press," "accepted," and similar terms refer to the status of a manuscript or article in the publication process.
> 
> "In press" means that the article has been accepted for publication and is currently being prepared for publication. This typically includes the process of copyediting, formatting, and proofreading. An article that is "in press" has not yet been published and is not yet available to the public.
> 
> "Accepted" means that the article has been reviewed by the journal and has been deemed suitable for publication. However, it has not yet been published and is not yet "in press."
> 
> Other terms that may be used to describe the status of a manuscript in the publication process include "submitted," which means that the article has been sent to a journal for review; "under review," which means that the article is being evaluated by the journal's editorial team; and "rejected," which means that the article has not been accepted for publication.
> 
> It's worth noting that the publication process can vary depending on the journal and the specific requirements of the editorial team. Some journals may have different stages of review or may use different terminology to describe the status of a manuscript.
