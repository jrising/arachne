**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Commercial Fishing Effort” as a data gap. Here is a summary of the challenges with VMS data:
> ===
> According to Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021), there are considerable data gaps pertaining to the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data, which primarily consists of information collected from commercial fishing vessels. VMS data, which utilize GPS to monitor the locations of participating vessels and the specific details of their fishing activities, provide a critical resource for understanding the extent, density, and catch of fishing activities. However, there are several issues and gaps with this system that hinder its utility in various key areas, including offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience and climate adaptation, offshore renewable energy siting and leasing, species and habitat management, permitting of offshore infrastructure, and state ocean planning efforts.
> 
> 
> One major issue is the regional variability in data availability, particularly that the northeastern region has more detailed and useful data compared to the data available elsewhere. This poses a significant problem for Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process, as complete and accessible VMS data are crucial for effective planning and decision-making. The reports suggest that there is an imperative need for data from other regions, including the mid-Atlantic where Delaware is located.
> 
> 
> The reports also stress the need for atlases or derived products that characterize where fish are caught, which should be updated at least annually rather than biannually. This is particularly relevant around the time of federal actions, such as offshore wind leasing milestones and fisheries management actions.
> 
> 
> Both reports express a demand for recreational fishing data, including the locations and types of fish caught, which are currently not deducted from VMS data. In addition, access to economic data is needed to help rank the economic importance of different fishing areas.
> 
> 
> Lastly, the reports reveal that these data require significant additional processing time, consultation with fishery management professionals, and that important attributes are often removed due to privacy concerns. This often requires the use of significant regional grant funds and can limit the accurate use of these data for decision making.
> 
> 
> Overall, gaps in VMS data, its availability, timeliness, quality, and processing make it difficult for stakeholders and decision-makers to fully understand the extent, density, and type of fishing activities in the regions of interest. Recommended improvements include enhanced data processing and publication, consistency in declaring gear types and codes, improved recreational fishing data, and enhanced access to economic data.
> ===
> And here is a summary describing the challenges with VTRs:
> ===
> Reflecting on Dewberry Engineers (2018), VTRs serve a crucial role in documenting catches landed by licensed fishermen. The data collected, which respect the confidentiality of fishermen by being released in summary or aggregate form, include diverse aspects ranging from vessel names, trip types, gear used, areas fished, species caught, dates and ports of landing, among others. However, several key issues could be better addressed with improved data.
> 
> 
> For instance, data improvements could better facilitate:
> Offshore aquaculture siting
> Fisheries management (managing fishing quotas, assessing fishery stock, managing protected species, economic analysis, developing fisheries management strategies, managing impacts to the fishing industry, conflict reduction between different uses, determining fishing activity and value, and identifying landing locations)
> Community resilience and climate adaptation
> Offshore renewable energy siting and leasing (minimizing impacts to fishing activities and species & habitat management)
> Maritime and navigation safety
> Permitting and siting for other offshore infrastructure (such as energy and telecommunications cables)
> 
> 
> The Mid-Atlantic region has undertaken analyses of VTR data to evaluate which ports fishermen hail from, rather than merely the locations of fishing areas. Although invaluable, these analyses require considerable stakeholder vetting and may not be applicable to other regions without further stakeholder engagement. Unfortunately, the VTR data currently available in the South Atlantic are out of date, and the data for the Pacific Islands only include commercial fishing. Recreational fishing data, particularly locations and types of fish, along with shore-based access locations for recreational fishing at a national scale, are notably lacking.
> 
> 
> Echoing Trice et al. (2021), processing and publishing data derived from VTRs is carried out by regional partners at significant cost and effort. To address this, annual agency-sponsored products are needed in more regions. To define appropriate planning products, consultations with the Fisheries Management Council (FMC), regional experts, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are necessary. Improvements are also needed in the consistency and completeness of original codes, documentation, and products interpolated at a spatial resolution that would support energy and aquaculture leasing. Furthermore, data on recreational fishing, including the location, type of fish caught, and shore-based access location, are needed.

> 
> The above illustrates the identified data gaps - in both the collection, processing, and utilization of the VTR data - and how they can impact maritime spatial planning decisions, including Delaware’s ocean and bay areas. Closing these data gaps could support improved decision making in these crucial areas (Dewberry Engineers, 2018; Trice et al., 2021).
> ===
> Can you combine these summaries, citing the underlying sources, and provide a general overview of the data gaps related to commercial fishing effort with a view toward data gaps relevant to Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, here is a synthesized account that covers the discussed data gaps in commercial fishing effort, particularly as it relates to Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data and Vessel Trip Report (VTR) data. 
> 
> The Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, including Delaware's ocean and bay areas, currently faces data gaps in both the collection and utilization of VMS and VTR data, which results in challenges for maritime spatial planning decisions (Dewberry Engineers, 2018; Trice et al., 2021). This information can be crucial for offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience and climate adaptation, offshore renewable energy siting and leasing, species and habitat management, permitting of offshore infrastructure, and state ocean planning efforts.

> VMS data, gathered from commercial fishing vessels, is fundamental to understanding the scope, density, and catch of fishing activities. However, issues arise with regional variability in data availability, the need for derived products that correctly portray where fish are caught, and demands for recreational fishing and economic data not currently derived from VMS data (Dewberry Engineers, 2018; Trice et al., 2021). For Delaware, specific challenges pertain to the less-detailed nature of data when compared to other areas, like the northeastern United States, curtailing the available foundation for integral planning and decision-making processes. Furthermore, there is often a need for significant additional processing time, consultation with fishery management professionals, while important attributes are often removed for privacy, which can limit the accurate use of these data.
> 
> VTR data, used for documenting catches landed by licensed fishermen, is also key to numerous maritime and fisheries management activities. Among the challenges related to VTR data are out-of-date data in certain areas, the exclusion of recreational fishing data, and the need for consultation with regional professionals to define appropriate planning products (Dewberry Engineers, 2018; Trice et al., 2021). Current analysis of the VTR data focuses on the ports fishermen hail from rather than the locations of fishing activities, but the application of such insights may be region-specific and need adjustments for utilization in Delaware's context. Also, the data available from the South Atlantic region and Pacific Islands are either dated or inadequate as they only include commercial fishing data.
> 
> Addressing these gaps in both VMS and VTR data, and bolstering data processing, availability, and consistency will aid stakeholders and decision-makers to gain a more complete understanding of the extent, density, and type of fishing activities in regions of interest, including Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process. These improvements necessitate ongoing regional consultations, enhanced consistency in declaring gear types and codes, and the ideally annual updating of atlases or derived products that showcase where fish are caught. Additionally, data encompassing recreational fishing and economic factors would significantly enhance the value and applicability of this information.
