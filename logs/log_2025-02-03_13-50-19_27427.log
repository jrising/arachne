**assistant**:
> The most common metric used to determine whether a real estate market favors buyers or sellers is the "Months of Inventory" or "Months Supply of Inventory" (MSI). This metric indicates how long it would take for all the current homes on the market to be sold, assuming no new homes are listed and the current pace of sales continues.
> 
> - **Buyers' Market:** If the MSI is greater than 6 months, it typically indicates a buyers' market. This means there is a larger supply of homes than demand, often leading to lower prices and more negotiation power for buyers.
> 
> - **Sellers' Market:** Conversely, if the MSI is less than 6 months, it suggests a sellers' market. This scenario implies that demand exceeds supply, which can drive up prices and give sellers more leverage.
> 
> Other supporting metrics and factors include:
> 
> - **Days on Market (DOM):** A lower average DOM can indicate a sellers' market, while a higher DOM suggests a buyers' market.
> 
> - **Median Home Prices:** Rising prices can indicate a sellers' market, whereas falling prices often suggest a buyers' market.
> 
> - **List-to-Sale Price Ratios:** A higher ratio (often above 100%) indicates that homes are selling for more than the list price, typical in a sellers' market.
> 
> - **Buyer Demand Indicators:** Mortgage applications and pending sales can also offer insights into buyer demand, helping determine market conditions.
> 
> - **Economic Indicators:** Local employment rates, wage growth, and demographic trends affect demand and supply dynamics.
> 
> Monitoring these metrics can provide comprehensive insights into the current state of a real estate market.
