> I have a call to mutate with across in dplyr, but the data remains unchanged. What could be wrong?
**assistant**:
> It's difficult to know what's going wrong without seeing your code and the data, but here are some common reasons why dplyr mutate() calls might not work:
> 
> 1. Missing `%>%` operator: If you are not chaining your `mutate()` call to a previous call, you might need to use the `%>%` operator to pipe the data into the mutate function.
> 
> 2. Incorrect data frame name: Make sure that you are using the correct data frame name in your call to `mutate()`.
> 
> 3. Typo in variable name: Check if there are any typos in the variable names used in your call to `mutate()`.
> 
> 4. Incorrect function syntax: Make sure that the function you're using inside `mutate()` has the correct syntax.
> 
> 5. Non-existent variable: If you are creating a new variable, make sure that the variable name does not already exist in your data frame.
> 
> 6. Incorrect `across` argument: If you are using `across` argument in `mutate()`, make sure that you have specified the correct variables to modify and that these variables actually exist in your data frame.
> 
> It may also be helpful to check the structure of the data frame before and after the `mutate()` call to see if the data has actually changed.
