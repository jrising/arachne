**assistant**:
> To execute a function after the `window.speechSynthesis.speak(...)` call is complete, you can utilize the `onend` event provided by the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object. Here is an example:
> 
> ```javascript
> // Create a new instance of SpeechSynthesisUtterance
> const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello, this is a test of speech synthesis.');
> 
> // Define a function to be called when the speech finishes
> utterance.onend = function(event) {
>   console.log('Speech synthesis finished speaking.');
>   myFunction(); // Call your function here
> };
> 
> // Function to be called after speech synthesis is complete
> function myFunction() {
>   console.log('This function executes after the speech has finished.');
>   // Add any additional functionality you need here
> }
> 
> // Speak the utterance
> window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
> ```
> 
> In the example above, `myFunction()` will be called when the speech synthesis is finished. The `onend` event is triggered once the utterance has been spoken completely. You can replace `myFunction()` with whatever logic you need to execute after the speech.
