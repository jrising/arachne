> Moving from the US to the UK is an exciting prospect! When it comes to maintaining your grant projects and student commitments, here are a few key considerations and steps you can take to manage the transition smoothly:
> 
> 1. **Review Grant Agreements**: Start by carefully reviewing the terms and conditions of your current funding agreements. Some grants may have stipulations about the principal investigator's location or organizational affiliation, which could affect your ability to continue leading the project from abroad.
> 
> 2. **Communicate with Funding Agencies**: Reach out to the funding agencies that support your projects. Explain your situation and discuss options, such as retaining your role as PI and managing the projects remotely, or transitioning to a co-PI model where a collaborator in the US takes on additional oversight responsibilities.
> 
> 3. **Institutional Affiliation**: If you're considering a position at a UK institution, explore whether they can host your grants. Some funding bodies allow for grants to be transferred to another institution, provided it meets specific criteria. You might need to coordinate between your current and prospective institutions to facilitate such a transfer.
> 
> 4. **Student Mentorship**: For students funded by your projects, maintain clear lines of communication about your move. If possible, ensure your students have access to local mentorship or support through collaborators, while continuing to supervise and support them remotely. Consider scheduling regular virtual meetings to keep your mentorship active and effective.
> 
> 5. **Legal and Tax Considerations**: Consult with legal and tax professionals to understand any implications of your move on your grant administration and personal finances. Tax regulations and obligations can vary, especially when it comes to income from different countries.
> 
> 6. **Network and Collaborate**: Leverage your move as an opportunity to expand your network. Collaborating with UK-based researchers can not only help bridge geographic gaps but also open doors to new funding opportunities and research collaborations in Europe and beyond.
> 
> If you have any specific grants or students more directly impacted, let me know, and I can try to offer more tailored advice.
