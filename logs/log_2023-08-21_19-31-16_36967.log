**assistant**:
> When you intend to sell your house while under a solar panel lease or loan agreement, a few options are available:
> 
> **1. Transferring the Lease/Loan to the New Homeowner:** With this option, the new buyer of your house takes over the remainder of your solar panel agreement. The lease/loan will continue under their name and they will make the rest of the payments. The company that issued the lease or loan must approve the transfer, and the new homeowner must have a certain credit score and meet other qualifications. 
> 
> **2. Prepaying the Lease/Loan:** If it's an option, you could consider prepaying the rest of your lease or loan. This can be attractive to buyers as it eliminates the responsibility of monthly payments. However, it may or may not financially make sense for you, depending on the amount left and the terms of your agreement. 
> 
> **3. Moving the Solar Panels to Your New House:** In some cases, it may be possible to physically move your solar panels to your new house. This can be a complex process, requiring an assessment of both your old and new property to ensure suitability for installation. There will also be costs associated with the removal and reinstallation of the panels.
> 
> Some buyers may see a functioning solar system as a plus, reducing their electricity bills and being environmentally friendly. Others may be deterred by the ongoing commitment or the aesthetics of solar panels. So, it's important to communicate the benefits and responsibilities to potential buyers early on and handle this issue transparently during the sale process. Ultimately, the option chosen would depend on the agreement with the solar panel company, personal preference, the potential buyerâ€™s preferences, and the housing market dynamics at the time of the sale.
