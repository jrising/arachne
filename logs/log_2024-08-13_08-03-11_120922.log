> I am trying to get an old TurboGears site running, which uses mongodb. I can nearly get it running, but I get an error-- I think from ming, and ODM for mongodb-- "TypeError: 'Collection' object is not callable. If you meant to call the 'end_request' method on a 'Collection' object it is failing because no such method exists."
> Then, when I try to downgrade the ming and pymongo libraries, I get an error "pymongo.errors.OperationFailure: Unsupported OP_QUERY command: createIndexes. The client driver may require an upgrade. For more details see https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/legacy-opcode-removal", which I think means that pymongo can't use the version of mongodb I have running.
> 
> First, does that sound right? Is the solution to now downgrade my mongodb?
> If so, any thoughts on how far I need to downgrade it?

**assistant**:
> Your interpretation of the situation seems to be accurate. TurboGears is a Python web application framework, and Ming is its Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB. If TurboGears is showing a TypeError related to a MongoDB collection, it suggests a compatibility issue between the versions of MongoDB, Ming, and Pymongo you are using.
> 
> This issue is not uncommon when working with legacy systems; newer versions of libraries or databases often deprecate or remove features that were available in older versions. 
> 
> 1. *"TypeError: 'Collection' object is not callable. If you meant to call the 'end_request' method on a 'Collection' object it is failing because no such method exists."*
> This error suggests that your current version of MongoDB has deprecated the 'end_request' method. This was a feature in older versions of MongoDB (pre-3.0) often used with Ming and older versions of Pymongo.
>  
> 2. *"pymongo.errors.OperationFailure: Unsupported OP_QUERY command: createIndexes. The client driver may require an upgrade. For more details see https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/legacy-opcode-removal".*
> This error indicates that the 'createIndexes' operation is no longer supported by your current MongoDB version, which is an operation MongoDB 3.0 and later use to create indexes.
> 
> The potential solution here is indeed to downgrade MongoDB. Downgrading to the version compatible with the MongoDB driver (i.e., PyMongo) your TurboGears site uses can resolve the issue.
> 
> **How far to downgrade?**
> Difficult to say without knowledge of the exact versions of Pymongo, Ming, and TurboGears you are using. However, the first error message points towards a feature deprecated in MongoDB 3.0, so a sensible starting place could be MongoDB 2.6.x. Test with this version, and if you still receive errors, you may need to go further.
> 
> **Important considerations for downgrading MongoDB:**
> Downgrading is a tricky process and can potentially result in data loss if not done correctly. Make sure you backup your data before attempting a downgrade and consider the potential impacts on any other services or applications using the same MongoDB instance. If possible, consider setting up an isolated environment for your old TurboGears site.
>  
> Also, downgrading is a temporary fix. In the long term, consider upgrading your TurboGears site to be compatible with newer versions of MongoDB, which will bring performance improvements and enhanced security.
