> "The paper currently foregrounds the modeling innovations as the focus of the paper, seemingly as ends in themselves. And yes, perhaps these innovations are methodologically valuable to agricultural economists working on modeling crop supply. But to me (and I expect to most JAERE readers) the more important contribution of the paper is to empirically investigate (a) how much selective harvesting of perennials understates the true effects of weather shocks, and (b) the mechanisms of adaptation, through unobserved crop management decisions. The modeling innovations are secondary – the main reason they are useful is that they allow for better answers to the empirical research questions."

For both annuals and perennials, farmers can respond to these environmental shocks with both short-term, intensive, and long-term, extensive management decisions. The effects of actions taken after observing a shock but before production outcomes are generally hidden to {\it ex post} statistical methods."

**assistant**:
> Certainly, I can assist with that. Here's a revised introduction which places greater emphasis on the empirical investigation of the effects of selective harvesting and the mechanisms of adaptation, while still highlighting the importance of the new modeling approach:

> "Perennial crops like coffee possess unique characteristics that demand a nuanced understanding of their responses to environmental shocks. As semi-durable capital, perennials necessitate long-term investment horizons and the management of environmental variability, a dimension that bears more resemblance to housing and manufacturing than to annual row crop production \citep{brady2013changes}. Yet, empirical data on critical factors such as plantings, removals, and age-distributions—central to perennials—are typically unavailable, causing many studies to rely on recorded harvest areas as proxies for investment and yields \citep{elnagheeb1993modeling, lobell2006impacts, askari1977estimating}. 
> 
> As this paper shows, reliance on recorded harvest areas can conflate planting decisions with harvesting decisions, obscuring the true impact of weather shocks on crop production and understating the potential for future adaptation. Poor weather can reduce yields and kill plants. Moreover, farmers' responses to these environmental shocks, which can involve both short-term intensive and long-term extensive management decisions, are often unseen by traditional {\it ex post} statistical methods. By presenting a unified statistical approach, we are able to shine a light on these hidden dynamics, offering new insights into how selective harvesting and unobserved crop management decisions can significantly influence our understanding of perennial crop adaptation in the face of climatic variability."

> Explanation of changes:
> 1. In the first paragraph, I retained your original text but removed the emphasis on the "difficulties" or "challenges", thereby decreasing the focus on the modeling-first perspective. Instead, I highlighted the fact that perennial crops require a different economic perspective due to their unique characteristics. 
> 
> 2. I further reinforced the empirical approach by stating that the lack of certain data has led previous studies to use proxies, implying that your paper seeks to address this issue.
> 
> 3. The second paragraph is reshaped to emphasize the empirical investigation. It starts with the statement of the problem as understood through traditional approaches, and then reveals how your paper addresses these issues. 
> 
> 4. I removed the term "confounding factors", which could suggest a focus on the modeling problem. Instead, I presented the problem as an underrepresentation of the true impact of weather shocks and the potential for future adaptation.
> 
> 5. The final sentence brings the model into the picture again but frames it as a tool for improving empirical understanding, aligning with the reviewer's comments.
