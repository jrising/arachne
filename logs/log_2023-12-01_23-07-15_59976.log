**user**:
> I see a dataset that offers, "The near-surface zonal and meridional total velocities, and near-surface radial velocities, measured by High Frequency radars that are part of the European High Frequency radar Network. These data are delivered together with standard deviation of near-surface zonal and meridional raw velocities, Geometrical Dilution of Precision (GDOP), quality flags and metadata."

**assistant**:
> "Near-surface zonal and meridional total velocities" in this dataset refers to the components of motion in specific geographical directions. Here's a breakdown:
> 
> - "Zonal" velocity typically refers to the east-west component of motion.
> - "Meridional" velocity typically refers to the north-south component of motion.
> 
> The "total velocity" is a combination of these two components, representing the complete velocity vector. To compute it, one typically applies the Pythagorean theorem, as these two components are usually perpendicular. The total velocity accounts for the motion in both directions (east-west and north-south) simultaneously.
> 
> "Radial" velocity, on the other hand, is a bit different. In the context of radar measurements, it's the velocity of an object directly towards (or directly away from) the radar station. In this case, the radial velocity is a component of the total velocity that is directly towards or away from the radar station.
> 
> Remember that "near-surface" indicates that these velocities are measured within a certain height range close to the Earth's surfaceâ€”as opposed to say, at high atmospheric levels or deep in the ocean.
