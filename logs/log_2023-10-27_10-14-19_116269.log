> I have been given the following request: --- As part of your duties at Elemental Excelerator you will need to help develop investment theses and then source, review, and assess startups that fit those theses, along with potential partners who might help them scale. Please research the following startups and recommend one startup for our Project Track in our next cohort. Alternatively, select a startup not on this list who you feel would be a great fit for Elemental and the energy portfolio. Make a case for why that startup should be added to our portfolio. Please consider not only the market opportunity and company, but also why they are a great fit for the Elemental community. In addition, Elemental is expanding our network of government and first -of-a-kind capital providers that are helping to provide catalytic financing solutions and earlier-stage project development capital (examples of whom include Lendistry, NYCEEC, Florida SELF, Spring Lane, Urban Us, Breakthrough Catalyst, etc). Please identify one public or private sector capital provider that would be well aligned with the startup you chose and why. Provide us with a one-page summary of how you arrived at these decisions. We will ask you to talk through your thought process and decisions during the interview as well. This is just an exercise, so there is no right answer! --- Can you offer a comprehensive development thesis that I can use for evaluating startups in the energy sector? In particular, what criteria should I evaluate startups on? How should I operationalize probability of financial success, impact, uniqueness, DEI considerations, founders history of sucess?

> When evaluating startups in the energy sector, it's important to have a comprehensive development thesis that considers multiple criteria. Here's a suggested framework for evaluating startups:
> 
> 1. Market Opportunity: Assess the size and growth potential of the target market. Consider factors such as demand, competition, regulatory landscape, and potential barriers to entry.
> 
> 2. Technology Innovation: Evaluate the uniqueness and potential impact of the startup's technology or solution. Look for patented or proprietary technologies, breakthrough advancements, and competitive advantages in the market.
> 
> 3. Financial Viability: Analyze the startup's business model, revenue streams, and projected financials. Assess the scalability and profitability potential, considering factors such as cost structure, revenue growth, and potential risks.
> 
> 4. Impact Potential: Examine the startup's potential environmental, social, and economic impact. Consider how their solution contributes to sustainability, greenhouse gas reduction, resource efficiency, or social equity. Look for measurable impact metrics and alignment with global sustainability goals.
> 
> 5. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): Evaluate the startup's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Consider the diversity of the founding team, board of directors, and employees. Look for evidence of inclusive practices, equal opportunities, and partnerships that promote diversity.
> 
> 6. Founders' Track Record: Assess the founders' experience, expertise, and past successes. Look for relevant industry knowledge, technical skills, leadership capabilities, and a track record of building successful ventures.
> 
> 7. Operational Excellence: Evaluate the startup's operational capabilities, including project management, supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution. Consider their ability to scale operations efficiently and effectively.
> 
> To operationalize the evaluation process, you can assign weights or scores to each criterion based on their relative importance. This will help create a standardized framework for comparing and ranking startups.
> 
> When assessing the probability of financial success, consider factors such as market demand, competitive landscape, revenue projections, and the startup's ability to secure funding and generate sustainable profits.
> 
> For impact, consider the potential positive environmental or social outcomes that the startup's solution can achieve. Look for quantifiable metrics, such as carbon emissions reductions or energy savings.
> 
> Uniqueness can be evaluated by assessing the startup's intellectual property, technical advantages, and differentiation from competitors. Look for solutions that offer novel approaches, disruptive technologies, or unique value propositions.
> 
> In evaluating DEI considerations, consider the startup's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in their team, culture, and policies. Look for evidence of diverse perspectives,
