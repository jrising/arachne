> Our family comes from Lutheran (dad) and Jewish (mom) roots. I would like to devise a blessing to say before meals that combines elements of (1) the dad's traditional German blessing or other Lutheran elements, (2) the mom's Jewish blessing, (3) a secular blessing (from the book Before We Eat), and (4) the Native American Thanksgiving Address (highlights below).

> I would like it to be fairly short-- maybe four couplets? With hints of multilingualness.
> 
> Can you give me a few options?
> 
> Here are the source materials:
> 
> 1. Gesunde Mahlzeit.
> 
> 2. Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, hamotzi lehem min ha'aretz.
> 
> 3. As we sit around this table let's give thanks as we are able
> To all the folks we'll never meet who helped provide the food we eat.
> They plowed the ground and planted seeds, tended fields, removed weeds.
> They picked the food at harvest time, working in the heat and grime.
> They grazed the cattle, fed the sows, gathered eggs, and milked the cows.
> They fished from boats out on the seas; raised wheat and nuts and honeybees,
> Thank the ones who packed the crates, sorted boxes, checked the weights.
> Thank the drivers on the roads in their trucks with heavy loads.
> And all the clerks at all the stores who did the grocery-selling chores.
> Thank the ones who bought this food, the ones who teach me gratitude.
> Sitting at this meal we share, we are grateful and aware,
> Sending thanks upon the air to those workers everyhwere.

> 4. Today we have gathered and when we look upon the faces around us we see that the cycles of life continue. We have been given the duty to live in balance and harmony with each other and all living things. So now let us bring our minds together as one as we give greetings and thanks to each other as People. Now our minds are one.
> We are thankful to our Mother the Earth, for she gives us everything that we need for life....
> We give thanks to all of the waters of the world for quenching our thirst, for providing strength and nurturing life for all beings....
> We turn our thoughts to all of the Fish life in the water....
> Now we turn toward the vast fields of Plant life....
> When we look about us, we see that the berries are still here, providing us with delicious foods....
> With one mind, we honor and thank all the Food Plants we harvest from the garden, especially the Three Sisters who feed the people with such abundance....
> Now we turn to the Medicine Herbs of the world....
> Standing around us we see all the Trees....
> We gather our minds together to send our greetings and thanks to all the beautiful animal life of the world, who walk about with us....
> We put our minds together as one and thank all the birds who move and fly about over our heads....
> We are all thankful for the powers we know as the Four Winds. We hear their voices in the moving air as they refresh us and purify the air we breathe....
> Now we turn to the west where our grandfathers the Thunder Beings live....
> We now send greetings and thanks to our eldest brother the Sun....
> We put our minds together and give thanks to our oldest Grandmother, the Moon, who lights the nighttime sky....
> We give thanks to the Stars who are spread across the sky like jewelry....
> We gather our minds to greet and thank the enlightened Teachers who have come to help throughout the ages....
> We now turn our thoughts to the Creator, or Great Spirit, and send greetings and thanks for all the gifts of Creation. Everything we need to live a good life is here on Mother Earth. For all the love that is still around us, we gather our minds together as one and send our choicest words of greetings and thanks to the Creator. Now our minds are one.

**user**:
> I find these all a bit corny. Perhaps it's phrases like "farm to table" or "harmony we sow". Can you try versions that are fairly musical but with just 4 lines?
> 
> Also, drop explicit references to multilingualism ("Multilingual, we all pray") while keeping the words from other languages.

> "Barukh ata Adonai," gratitude woven in.
> Hands unseen, yet felt in every bite,
> In unity with Earth, we share this rite.
> 
> Can you provide variations on this theme? But change the "hands unseen" idea-- better to just refer to the people whose hands those are (farmers, fishers, etc.).
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, I'm glad you found an option you liked. Here are a few variations on that theme:
> 
> Option 1:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," our voices unite,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," in this soft light.
> To the farmer, the fisher, their toil we cite,
> In unity with Earth, we share this rite.

> In unity with Earth, we are kindly led.
**user**:
> Are there any particularly powerful sayings or blessings that I might want to incorporate into this?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, I can suggest a few powerful sayings or blessings from different traditions that you might find relevant. However, please note that I'm being respectful of their original contexts and purposes. These phrases can be adapted to fit your family's unique blessing:
> 
> 1. From Buddhism: "May we and all beings be happy and free."
> 2. From Hinduism: "Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu" - "May all beings everywhere be happy and free."
> 3. Native American: "Mitakuye Oyasin" - "We are all related," or "All my relations."
> 4. From Christianity: "Give us this day our daily bread."
> 5. Jewish: "Shehecheyanu" - "Blessed are You, Lord, our God, ruler of the Universe who has kept us alive, sustained us, and enabled us to reach this season."
> 6. Secular: "To peace and plenty."
> 
> Here's how they could be woven into your mealtime blessing:
> 
> Option 1:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," we begin,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," gratitude woven in.
> "To peace and plenty," for each worker's might,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," with Earth, we share this rite.

**user**:
> I like:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," we begin,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," gratitude woven in.
> "To peace and plenty," for each worker's might,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," with Earth, we share this rite.
> 
> But the lines have such different numbers of syllables (e.g., 7 for the first, 13 for the second). Can this be made more consistent? To be clear, as I read it, "Gesunde Mahlzeit" has 5 syllables, and "Barukh ata Adonai" has 7. Perhaps a version with 9 syllables per line, so that the line with "Barukh ata Adonai" has space for 2 more syllables after it.
> 
> Can you provide a few options?
**assistant**:
> Of course, maintaining a consistent syllable count can help to establish a rhythm in your blessing. Here are a few variations that follow a 9-syllable pattern:
> 
> Option 1:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," we proclaim,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," in God's name.
> To those whose labor brings us food,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," our gratitude.
> 
> Option 2:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," meal's begun,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," setting sun.
> "To peace and plenty," we recite,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," in Earth's delight.
> 
> Option 3:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," we express,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," we confess.
> For each hand that nurtures life,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," ends all strife.
> 
> Option 4:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," we hold dear,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," clear.
> For the workers, our hearts ignite,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," in Earth's pure light.
**user**:
> I really like this version:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," we proclaim,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," in God's name.
> To those whose labor brings us food,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," our gratitude.
> 
> However, the syllables are still not quite right. Can you fill in these slightly differently in a few variations?
> 
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," [3 syllables] proclaim,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," in God's name.
> To [8 syllables] food,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," our gratitude.
**assistant**:
> Of course, let's fine-tune this to get the syllable count just right.

> Option 4:
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," all hearts proclaim,
> "Barukh ata Adonai," in God's name.
> To those who from earth's bounty our meals conclude,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," our gratitude.
**user**:
> It's almost there, but I don't love the word "proclaim". Can you edit this, to say that we join our voices to say, while still rhyming the first two lines?
> 
> "Gesunde Mahlzeit," [5 syllables, mentioning a gathering],
> "Barukh ata Adonai," [3 syllables, mentioning God],
> To those who harvest, fish, and plow our food,
> "Mitakuye Oyasin," our gratitude.
**assistant**:
