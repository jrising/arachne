**assistant**:
> The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) both use macroeconomic models to project key economic variables such as GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, and government debt. 
> 
> Some of the key macroeconomic variables that are typically projected in these models include:
> - Gross Domestic Product (GDP): the total value of goods and services produced within a country's economy
> - Inflation: the rate at which the overall price level of goods and services is increasing
> - Unemployment: the percentage of the labor force that is not currently employed but actively seeking employment
> - Interest rates: the rate at which borrowing costs change
> - Government debt: the total amount of money that a government has borrowed
> - Balance of trade: the difference between a country's exports and imports
> - Consumer Price Index (CPI) : a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.
> - Producer Price Index (PPI) : a measure of the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output.
> 
> These models also take into account factors such as demographic changes, technological progress, and global economic conditions.
> 
> Both the IMF and CBO use these variables and models to project the economic performance of a country and to evaluate the impact of policy changes on the economy.
