> I want to install an old version of R under my conda environment, but when I try conda install r-base=3.2.2, I get the error that it doesn't exist. How can I do this, or otherwise find out what versions exist?
**assistant**:
> Firstly, let's clarify some details about package management. Conda should be able to provide quite a few versions of the R package, but it might not have every single version. 
> 
> You can search for available versions using:
> 
> ```
> conda search -f r-base
> ```
> 
> If `3.2.2` is not an available option, identify the closest one which meets your needs.
> 
> When installing an older version of R, you should also consider creating a new conda environment as to not conflict with potentially newer R packages you have in your current environment. You can create a new environment using the following command:
> 
> ```
> conda create -n my_old_R_env r-base=3.X.X
> ```
> 
> Replace `3.X.X` with your intended version from the available options.
> 
> Subsequently, you can activate the new environment using:
> 
> ```
> conda activate my_old_R_env
> ```
> 
> If version `3.2.2` specifically is not available through conda, consider using an older MRAN snapshot. MRAN is the Microsoft R Application Network, and it provides daily snapshots of the CRAN R package repository. 
> 
> You can use the `install.packages()` function in R with the `repos` parameter set to the URL of the date snapshot you're interested in; e.g. for version `3.2.2`, you would use a date on which this version was current.
> 
> Remember, this might involve more package compatibility issues, since the packages available on that date might be quite old. This can possibly break your code if it relies on functions not available or changed in those versions. So, caution is advised when proceeding this way.
> 
> Essentially, you'll do:
> 
> ```R
> install.packages('desired-package', repos='https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/YYYY-MM-DD')
> ```
> 
> Replace 'desired-package' with the package you want to install and 'YYYY-MM-DD' with the appropriate date of the MRAN snapshot.
> 
> Remember, all this should be done in the R console or an equivalent R environment.
