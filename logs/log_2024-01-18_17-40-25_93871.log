**assistant**:
> Based on your R output, it seems that upon exporting your DataFrame from Python to R, the DataFrame format was not preserved correctly. The `py2rpy` function has converted your DataFrame into a Named Vector in R. The "column names" you're seeing here are actually indexes and the rest of the data are the values corresponding to those indexes. 
> 
> One reason for this might be because your pandas DataFrame has a non-default (multi-level, hierarchical) index. R's data.frames objects don't support multi-index structures with named indexes, similarly to Pandas, so `py2rpy` ends up collapsing your DataFrame into a Named Vector.
> 
> To preserve your DataFrame structure, one recommended workflow is to reset your DataFrame's index in Pandas, before exporting the DataFrame to R. This will treat your DataFrame's index as just another column. Here's a modified version of your code:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> from rpy2.robjects import pandas2ri
> import rpy2.robjects as ro
> 
> pandas2ri.activate()
> 
> # Reset the index and save the result back to df
> df = df.reset_index()
> 
> r_df = pandas2ri.py2rpy(df)
> ro.globalenv['df'] = r_df
> ro.r.save('df', file="totalcosts.RData")
> ```
> 
> Then, when you load `df` in R, each field of your original index should now be its own column in the R dataframe.
