> I have been told that developing countries face the lowest abatement costs "which in large measure goes hand-in-hand with their high carbon intensity, since they still have at their disposal the cheapest abatement options. Regions that have decarbonised their economies to a greater extent are likely to find further savings more expensive." Is there a citation that makes this point?

**assistant**:
> Absolutely, the statement you mentioned aligns with common observations in environmental economics. Developing countries typically have higher carbon intensities and lower abatement costs because they can adopt more cost-effective, lower-hanging fruit options for reducing emissions.
> 
> A key reference that elaborates on this point is the **IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)**, specifically **Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change**. It discusses the marginal abatement costs and how they differ across regions based on their current carbon intensity and stages of economic development.

> You might find the relevant discussion in **Chapter 6: Assessing Transformation Pathways** and **Chapter 15: National and Sub-national Policies and Institutions** of the report, where the distribution of abatement costs across different regions is analyzed.
