**user**:
> Is there a name for a meeting that happens every 3 weeks?
**assistant**:
> No specific term exists in common English language usage for a meeting that occurs every three weeks. We typically refer to such meetings simply as "tri-weekly meetings," "meetings that occur every three weeks," or "three-week cycle meetings." Remember to ensure that all participants are aware of the unusual frequency, as "tri-weekly" could be misunderstood to mean three times per week.
