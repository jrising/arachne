> Summary for Policy Makers
> The physical impacts of climate change have become a macro-relevant and for some countries a macro-critical issue, significantly affecting the responsibilities of Ministries of Finance (MoFs) worldwide. These impacts can directly damage physical assets and infrastructure, with significant damage to public sector, household and firm balance sheets while having wider systemic effects which disrupt livelihoods and economic activities with consequences for fiscal policy, growth, employment, trade, inflation, and access to health and education. These impacts can also further threaten the stability of the public finances, as well as the broader stability of financial systems, as cascading effects propagate through the system when loan or insurance mechanisms lack sufficient coverage.
> 
> It is therefore increasingly important for MoFs to take strong action to address and respond to these risks. However, to effectively build resilience and promote adaptation, MoFs need to be able to answer the pressing policy questions facing them. This report categorizes the potential role of Ministries of Finance in building resilience and adaptation, and the necessary policy questions to address it, in three key areas: 
> 
> First, MoFs face questions regarding the direct and indirect economic and fiscal consequences of physical risks. To effectively manage climate risks, MoFs can benefit from a comprehensive understanding of current and future climate hazards, risk drivers, and impacts on the economy, public finances, and financial sector. This can allow MoF to be better prepared to protect their economies from the negative consequences of climate change, for which they have a wide array of economic and fiscal policy tools and financial instruments available.
> 
> Second, moving beyond assessing physical risks, MoFs can play an important role in government efforts on adaptation, defined as adjusting to the actual or expected effects of climate change to enhance resilience and reduce harm from long-term climatic change and more frequent extreme weather events. Assessing the costs and benefits of investment in adaptation in order to enhance resilience is critical across all climate scenarios and can be integrated with mitigation efforts to ensure a successful green transition. Whilst effective adaptation requires a multisectoral approach with climate risks deeply interconnected with sectors such as agriculture, health, and finance, MoFs play a central role in driving adaptation both within their core functions and across government. MoF can develop targeted fiscal policies and invest in resilience to safeguard fiscal stability. Given fiscal constraints and the multiple priorities facing MoFs, MoFs can benefit from a robust understanding of the effects of adaptation on fiscal policy, the financial sector, and its broader macroeconomic implications.
> 
> Lastly, adaptation requires substantial investment from both public and private sectors, with Ministries of Finance playing a key role in assessing funding needs and determining how to mobilize public and private resources. By leveraging economic policy options and financial instruments, MoFs can also incentivize private investment to finance adaptation. Understanding the magnitude and financial implications of financing adaptation is key to assessing and mobilizing investment.
> 
> To effectively assess the impacts of physical climate risks and adaptation measures, build resilience, and develop robust adaptation strategies, Ministries of Finance can leverage a diverse array of economic analysis and modeling tools that offer valuable insights to inform decision-making. There is a wide array of tools available that this report covers, including:
> 
> ·         Multiple tools that draw on models focused on climate hazards and link them with models that assess the economy to understand the overall economic implications of climate physical risks. Such models include Integrated Assessment Models (IAMS), catastrophe models, and loss and damage assessments (See table 4).
> 
> ·         To identify and quantify potential adaptation solutions, tools which cover both bottom-up approaches, where adaptation options, costs, and benefits are explicitly modeled at the local level, and top-down approaches, where adaptation is empirically assessed by observing differences in climate vulnerability across regions. This includes utilizing cost-benefit analysis and real options analysis to evaluate economic trade-offs of different adaptation strategies or managing the uncertainties behind future climate change physical risks.
> 
> ·         To help MoFs understand how to finance adaptation, multiple tools and frameworks that can help assess financing requirements. This included assessing gaps in adaptation plans and accounting climate change adaptation expenditure in the budget through methodologies such as Climate Budget Tagging (CBT), Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) and the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability – Climate (PEFA-C). To develop disaster risks finance approaches methodologies such as risk layering can help MoFs determine whether it is more appropriate for them to reduce risk, insure against risk, or compensate stakeholders in the event of a disaster.
> 
> While climate risk modeling and analysis are still evolving, open-source tools and global institutions and initiatives increasingly provide access to valuable resources, alongside a growing set of examples from countries and institutions. The report draws on case study examples of analysis in practice provided by 24 contributions to the overall program’s compendium of practice. The report highlights how these examples can guide and inform effective decision-making and adaptation strategies. Moreover, the report:
> 
> ·         illustrates 14 example case studies, tools, and approaches for identifying and quantifying current and future physical climate impacts on the macroeconomy and public finances;
> 
> ·         provides detailed instruction on eight tools and models for estimation of physical climate risk on macroeconomic outcomes relevant for MoFs: 1) IAMs; 2) Social Accounting Matrices; 3) Scenario based approaches; 4) catastrophe models; 5) Loss and damage assessments; 6) extreme event attribution; 7) asset level analysis; and 8) impact chain frameworks;
> 
> ·         outlines 18 example case studies, tools, and approaches to identify and quantify potential adaptation solutions to manage physical risks; and
> 
> ·         details 32 example case studies, tools, and approaches designed to help MoFs decide how to finance adaptation.
> 
> Furthermore, while analytical and modelling challenges remain, it is critical for MoFs to take early action to invest in analytical capability, collaborate with researchers, and expand their understanding of options for investing in adaptation.
> 
> Lastly, while using macroeconomic tools and models can provide valuable insights for policy makers, the scale, urgency and complexity of physical climate risks require engagement and cooperation across government. This report therefore emphasizes the need for closer engagement between modelers and policy makers within MoFs and across government to better integrate climate risks into fiscal policies in a manner that can meet demands of practical decision-making. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of cross-government coordination and capacity-building efforts to improve climate risk management, with opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange helping to bridge gaps between expertise and resources. Advice on which tools, data, and models are most useful for MoFs to draw on, as well as guidance on what approaches to avoid, is not currently widely available and accessible to many MoFs. The Coalition’s Community of Practice is designed to help address this gap, and we hope that this report can serve as a starting point for these discussions. The main take-aways from the report are outlined below.
> 
> Key takeaways
> 1)      Prompt policy decisions regarding the management of physical climate risks through adaptation are crucial. However, without clearly defined adaptation objectives, the question of ‘how much adaptation’ often remains subjective and normative. Ministries of Finance have an important role to play by:
> 
> a.       Identifying and assessing current and future physical climate risks and their impacts on the macroeconomy and public finances;
> 
> b.       Identifying and evaluating potential adaptation solutions and their costs and benefits; and
> 
> c.       Determining financing mechanisms for adaptation
> 
>  
> 
> 2)      Ministries of Finance need to act now to improve their understanding of physical climate risks and the economic and fiscal consequences. A good first step to incorporate analytical tools to inform on physical risk would be to invest in improved analytical tools and data collection that accurately reflect climate change's economic impacts, including updated damage functions and models that account for non-linear relationships and tipping points.
> 
>  
> 
> 3)      Users in Ministries of Finance should acknowledge the limitations of their analytical tools and assess their effectiveness, but uncertainty should not prevent action. It is crucial to balance detailed analytics with practical, policy-focused analysis, as the costs of inaction are high. This involves implementing low- and no-regret actions that provide economic and social benefits despite climate uncertainty.

> 4)      The integration of adaptation into macroeconomic assessments remains a developing area, with a variety of both bottom-up and top-down modeling strategies providing initial frameworks for commencement. This report outlines nine tools and models for assessing physical climate risk and its macroeconomic implications and discusses recent developments: 1) Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs); 2) Input-Output Models; 3) Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models; 4) Scenario-based approaches; 5) Catastrophe models; 6) Loss and damage assessments; 7) Extreme event attribution; 8) Asset-level analysis; and 9) Impact chain frameworks.
> 
>  
> 
> 5)      Damage functions are a core element of the climate risk analysis that Ministries of Finance undertake, for example when using IAMs like the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy (DICE) model. It is essential for Ministries of Finance to acknowledge that current damage functions tend to undervalue the economic repercussions of physical climate risks due to the constraints of existing methodologies.
> 
>  
> 
> 6)      Ministries of Finance need tools and strategies to address common policy questions, particularly:
> 
> a.       integrating adaptation into macroeconomic evaluations
> 
> b.       managing uncertainty in climate projections and economic responses;
> 
> c.       overcoming the focus on addressing or reducing risks rather than retrospective response to impacts;
> 
> d.       incorporating non-linear effects and tipping points;
> 
> e.       capturing complexity of compound and cascading impacts across systems; and
> 
> f.        broadening analysis to include compounding shocks, adaptation limits, and ecological system interactions.
> 
>  
> 
> 7)      Analyzing the economics of adaptation requires a collaborative approach, combining engineering studies to assess adaptation types and their effectiveness with economic evaluations of costs and benefits. Open-source resources like the CLIMADA tool support climate adaptation strategies by simulating the economic impacts of extreme weather events.
> 
>  
> 
> 8)      Investing in adaptation offers co-benefits, often referred to as ‘triple dividends,’ and highlights the important connections between adaptation, mitigation, and development investments. However, these aspects are frequently ignored in analyses conducted by Ministries of Finance or lack clear definitions. Only climate resilient development investments that incorporate current and future physical risk trends contribute to adaptation efforts.
> 
>  
> 
> 9)      Data and tools alone do not improve decision-making in Ministries of Finance. Clear communication between analysts and policymakers is essential. Additionally, managing physical risks overlaps with other policy areas, often resulting in unclear risk ownership. Ministries of Finance can promote coordination among departments for climate adaptation and encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing with those assessing physical risks and adaptation
