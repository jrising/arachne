**user**:
> In an academic paper, I get a result that a total risk estimate is 10%, but then I want to immediately clarify that 5% of that total is estimated using bottom-up calculations, 4% from catastrophic risks, and 1% from missing risks. Is there a way I can say this briefly? Would the terms comprising or composed of help?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use the terms "comprising" or "composed of" to convey the breakdown of the total risk estimate in a concise manner. Here's an example sentence that reflects the breakdown you mentioned:
> 
> "The total risk estimate is 10%, comprising 5% estimated using bottom-up calculations, 4% from catastrophic risks, and 1% from missing risks."
> 
> Alternatively, you could use the phrase "broken down into" to convey the same idea:
> 
> "The total risk estimate of 10% is broken down into 5% estimated using bottom-up calculations, 4% from catastrophic risks, and 1% from missing risks."
> 
> These phrases effectively indicate that the specified percentages are components or subsets of the total risk estimate, allowing you to convey the breakdown clearly and succinctly.
