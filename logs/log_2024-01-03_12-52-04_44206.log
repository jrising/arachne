**user**:
> In my family, there's a day (I think in January) where we put out our shoes as kids and the next morning they had chocolate coins in them. What day is that associated with?
**assistant**:
> The tradition of putting out shoes to get gifts is associated with St. Nicholas' Day, which is celebrated on December 6th in many parts of the world. However, you mentioned a traditional family celebration in January. This may align with the Feast of the Epiphany, also known as Three Kings' Day, celebrated on January 6th. 
> 
> During this occasion, it's a common practice in some cultures for children to put their shoes out the night before, and to find them filled with gifts and sweets in the morning, to honor the Three Wise Menâ€™s gifts to the baby Jesus. The chocolate coins could symbolize the gold offered by one of the Wise Men. 
> 
> Please confirm with your family if it's the Epiphany celebration you're referring to, as traditions can vary considerably and might also be unique to your family.
