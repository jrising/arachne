> I need to write a short section in a grant proposal on the institution where it will take place. The question is:
> "Who or what is the legal organization receiving the funding? What is the organization’s background, what do they do, why do they exist, and what’s their scale of operations (staffing, budget, geographic footprint)?"

> My current text is:
> The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) will coordinate the project and provide a framework for other groups to contribute.

> GRI is a world-recognised leader in climate policy. GRI is a multidisciplinary centre, bringing together expertise on economics, finance, geography, the environment, science, law, international relations, development and political science.

> I got a longer text from someone at LSE, as follows:
> The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment was established by the London School of Economics and Political Science in 2008 to create a world-leading multidisciplinary centre for policy-relevant research and training on climate change and the environment, bringing together international expertise from across LSE and beyond, including on economics, finance, geography, the environment, science, law, international relations, development and political science. The Institute’s purpose is to accelerate the transition, and remove obstacles, to a sustainable, inclusive and resilient world, by: 
> 
> increasing knowledge and understanding by performing world-class multidisciplinary research on climate change and the environment; 
> promoting better informed decision-making about climate change and the environment by engaging with a wide range of key stakeholders and audiences around the world; and 
> educating and training new generations of researchers and professionals. 
>  
> 
> The Institute is chaired by Professor Lord Nicholas Stern, with a senior management team led by Acting Director Professor Giles Atkinson. The Institute has established itself as a leading source of research, analysis and engagement on climate change economics and policy, and its staff have received national and international recognition for their work. In 2021, the Institute was awarded a Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education for its leading international role in the economics, investment policy and legislation essential for the implementation of practical measures addressing climate change.

**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a revised version that integrates key elements from both versions while remaining concise:
> 
> The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) will coordinate the project, harnessing its multidisciplinary expertise in economics, finance, geography, and environmental policy. Established in 2008, GRI exists to accelerate the transition to a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world by conducting world-class research, engaging with stakeholders worldwide, and educating future professionals. Chaired by Professor Lord Nicholas Stern, GRI is recognized internationally for its leadership in climate policy and was awarded the 2021 Queen's Anniversary Prize for its significant contributions to climate economics and policy.
