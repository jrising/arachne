> The following is from a draft update to Circular A-4, used in US cost-benefit analysis. Can you provide brief bullet points for a response comment, from the perspective of progressive welfare economics?
> 
> Introduction
> 
> This Circular is designed to assist analysts in the regulatory
> agencies by providing guidance on conducting high-quality and
> evidence-based regulatory analysis—referred to as either “regulatory
> analysis” or “analysis” in this Circular for brevity—and standardizing
> the way benefits and costs of Federal regulatory actions are measured
> and reported. Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory
> Planning and Review)1 —as amended by the Executive Order of April 6,
> 2023 (Modernizing Regulatory Review)—and Executive Order 13563 of
> January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)2 require
> agencies to conduct a regulatory analysis for regulatory actions that
> are significant as defined by Section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order
> 12866, and more generally to assess the benefits and costs of other
> significant actions. These requirements apply to regulatory actions
> that rescind or modify existing regulations as well as to new
> regulatory actions. This Circular is intended to aid agencies in their
> analysis of the benefits and costs of regulations, both when such
> analysis is required under Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 and when
> agencies undertake analysis as a matter of discretion.
> 
> Scope of Analysis
> 
> In many circumstances, your primary analysis should focus on the effects of a regulation
> that are experienced by citizens and residents12 of the United States (which will often be the
> primary effects of the regulation). When feasible and appropriate, all such important effects
> should be included, regardless of whether they result directly from a regulation’s domestic
> applicability, or indirectly from a regulation’s impact on foreign entities. Indirect effects may
> arise through markets (e.g., changes in the costs imposed on foreign producers that affect U.S.
> consumers or investors) or outside of markets (e.g., changes in foreign ecosystem services13 that
> affect U.S. citizens and residents but are not reflected in market transactions). Relevant effects
> also include the effects of a regulation on U.S. strategic interests, including the potential for
> inducing strategic reciprocity or other policy changes from actors abroad or effects on U.S.
> government assets located abroad. Such effects are particularly likely to occur when your
> regulation bears on a global commons or a public good.14 In addition, relevant effects include
> those that occur entirely outside the United States when they affect U.S. citizens and residents,
> such as effects experienced by citizens residing abroad. These examples of relevant effects
> experienced by U.S. citizens and residents are not exhaustive, and appropriate care should be
> taken to identify all such important effects in your regulatory analysis. To better inform
> policymakers and the public of the effects of your regulation, it may be appropriate to also
> analyze effects on noncitizens residing abroad15 in a supplementary analysis when your primary
> analysis focuses on the effects on U.S. citizens and residents.
> 
> In certain contexts, it may be particularly appropriate to include effects experienced by
> noncitizens residing abroad in your primary analysis. Such contexts
> include, for example, when:
> * assessing effects on noncitizens residing abroad provides a useful proxy for effects on
> U.S. citizens and residents that are difficult to otherwise estimate;
> * assessing effects on noncitizens residing abroad provides a useful proxy for effects on
> U.S. national interests that are not otherwise fully captured by effects experienced by
> particular U.S. citizens and residents (e.g., national security interests, diplomatic
> interests, etc.);
> * regulating an externality on the basis of its global effects supports a cooperative
> international approach to the regulation of the externality by potentially inducing other
> countries to follow suit or maintain existing efforts; or
> * international or domestic legal obligations require or support a global calculation of
> regulatory effects.
> 
> When your primary analysis focuses on the global effects of the regulation, it is generally
> appropriate to produce a separate supplementary analysis of the effects experienced by U.S.
> citizens and residents, unless you determine that such effects cannot be separated in a practical
> and reasonably accurate manner, or that the separate presentation of such effects would likely be
> misleading or confusing in light of the factors detailed above.
> 
> Temporal Scope of Analysis
> 
> The time frame for your analysis should include a period before and after the date of
> compliance that is long enough to encompass all the important benefits and costs likely to result
> from the regulation.19 See the section “Discount Rates” for more details on the appropriate time
> frame for an analysis. If benefits or costs become more uncertain or harder to quantify over
> time, that does not imply that you should exclude such effects by artificially shortening your
> analytic time frame; instead, consult—as appropriate—the discussion in the section “Treatment
> of Uncertainty."
> 
> Developing Benefit and Cost Estimates
> 
> The regulatory analysis should discuss the expected benefits, costs, and transfers of the
> selected regulatory option and reasonable alternatives. How is the proposed action expected to
> cause the anticipated effects? What is the monetized value of the expected benefits and costs to
> society, or transfers within society? To present your results, you should:
> * include separate schedules of the monetized benefits, costs, and transfers that show the
> type and timing of effects, and express the estimates in this table in constant (all
> indexed to inflation as of the same year), undiscounted dollars (for more on
> discounting see the section “Discount Rates” below);
> * include schedule(s) of monetized net benefits for each analyzed subgroup (when
> subgroups are analyzed), and express the estimates in these table(s) in discounted
> dollars (for more on distributional analysis see the section “Distributional Effects”
> below);
> * list the benefits, costs, and transfers that you can quantify, but cannot monetize,
> including their timing;
> * describe benefits, costs, and transfers that you cannot quantify; and
> * identify or cross-reference the data or studies on which you base the benefit, cost, or
> transfer estimates.

> Response Comment from a Progressive Welfare Economics Perspective:
> 
> 1. Focus on inequality: 
>    - Emphasize the need to consider distributional effects, as progressive welfare economics focuses on addressing inequality.
>    - Encourage the analysis of how regulations impact different income groups, marginalized communities, and future generations.
> 
> 2. Broader definition of well-being:
>    - Urge the inclusion of non-monetary factors such as health, education, and overall well-being when measuring the benefits and costs of regulatory actions.
>    - Promote the use of alternative metrics, such as subjective well-being, capabilities, or social welfare functions, alongside traditional cost-benefit analysis.
> 
> 3. Emphasize the importance of the environment and sustainability:
>    - Ensure that the analysis takes into account the long-term environmental impacts of regulations, as environmental sustainability is a key concern for progressive welfare economics.
>    - Highlight the need for regulations that address externalities like climate change and pollution, which disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities.
> 
> 4. Consideration of global effects:
>    - Encourage a broader view of the analysis, considering the global effects of regulation and promoting international cooperation in tackling global challenges.
>    - Advocate for regulations that account for the well-being of noncitizens and the environment abroad, as progressive welfare economics supports the idea of global interdependence.
> 
> 5. Addressing uncertainty:
>    - Stress the importance of precautionary approaches when dealing with uncertainties, as progressive welfare economics favors policy actions that minimize the potential for irreversible harm, especially to disadvantaged populations.
>    - Recommend robust decision-making strategies that consider a range of possible scenarios, and focus on reducing inequalities and enhancing well-being in the face of uncertainty.
> 
> 6. Stakeholder engagement:
>    - Emphasize the need for more inclusive and democratic processes when conducting regulatory analysis, involving affected communities in the decision-making process.
>    - Encourage greater transparency and sharing of data, as well as active collaboration between agencies, academia, and civil society in conducting regulatory analysis.

> Methods for Treating Non-Monetized Benefits, Costs, and Transfers
> 
> Sound quantitative estimates of benefits, costs, and transfers, where feasible, are
> preferable to qualitative descriptions of benefits, costs, and transfers, because quantitative
> estimates succinctly summarize the magnitudes of the effects of alternative actions. As a general

> and assessment of non-monetized and non-quantified benefits, costs,
> and transfers.
> 
> When it is not possible to quantify or monetize all of the important benefits and costs of a

> Accounting for the Benefits and Costs from Environmental Services, Ecosystem

> 
> In order to provide policymakers with relevant information, an
> analysis should account for effects on environmental or ecosystem
> services, or changes in the value of natural assets, if relevant and
> feasible, in your benefit-cost analysis. The phrase “ecosystem

> elements of nature that are enjoyed, consumed, or used in a manner
> that affects human well-being; the phrase “environmental services”
> refers to the abiotic portion of ecosystem services.88 Natural assets,
> or natural capital, are physical biotic or abiotic natural resources
> capable of providing—or contributing to—future welfare, potentially
> through environmental or ecosystem services. Natural capital is
> distinguished from ecosystem services in that natural capital is a
> stock (measure of quantity) whereas ecosystem services are a flow
> (measure of change in quantity over time). The two are connected, and

> Economic Values of Uncertain Outcomes
> 
> You should attempt to determine the risk preferences of the population impacted by your

> and is consistent with common models of rational preferences.130 Nevertheless, there are a
> variety of circumstances in which risk aversion may not be material to your analysis and you

> preferences in your analysis because the consequences of incorporating them would be
> negligible.131 Second, when people are already fully insured against a risk or could choose to be
> so, regulations affecting that risk may not offer any additional insurance benefits to the affected
> population.132 As a result, when a regulation only addresses such risks, consideration of risk
> aversion may not be material to estimating the benefits and costs of the regulation. However—
> due to incomplete markets, the existence of uninsurable risks, and other distortions—full
> insurance may not be obtainable, and it is generally not appropriate to presume the existence of
> full insurance unless there is evidence that it is present. In these circumstances, if your analysis
> takes a risk-neutral approach, you should explain why. Finally, as noted previously, while risk
> aversion is widespread, there may be contexts in which some people are risk-neutral or riskseeking. If there is evidence that this is the case in a context that is relevant to your regulation,

> A Default Approach to the Social Rate of Time Preference
> 
> One approach assumes that the real (inflation-adjusted) rate of return

> government debt provides a fair approximation of the social rate of time preference. It is the
> rate available on riskless personal savings and is therefore a rate at which individuals may
> increase future consumption at the expense of current consumption. It is also the rate at which
> society as a whole can trade current consumption for future
> consumption.141
> 
> Over the last thirty years,142 this rate has averaged around 1.7 percent in real terms on a
> pre-tax basis. OMB arrives at this figure by considering the 30-year average of the yield on 10-
> year Treasury notes minus the average annual rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI)
> over the period within that 30 years that 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are not
> available (currently, 1993 to 2002), and the yield of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
> Securities over the period they are available (currently, 2003 to 2022).143 This produces a real
> 10-year rate of 1.7 percent,144 and corresponds to a social rate of
> time preference of 1.7 percent.
> 
> Alternative Approaches
> 
> There are other appropriate approaches to discounting.146 For example, you may also
> analyze the welfare effects of your regulation in an economic model in which the evolution of

> r_t = rho + eta g_t
> where 𝑟௧ is the social rate of time preference in year t, ρ is the pure rate of time preference, η is
> the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption, and 𝑔௧ is the representative agent’s
> consumption growth rate in year t. There are a variety of established methods of calibrating
> Ramsey parameters. For example, the model can be calibrated so the social rate of time
> preference matches market data on real interest rates148 or to allow the social rate of time
> preference to be a function of empirical estimates of the pure rate of time preference, the

> We recognize the updated guidelines' emphasis on accounting for effects on capital, long-term discounting, and intergenerational equity. The ethical considerations regarding the comparison of benefits and costs across generations and the responsibility of the current society to act in the interest of future citizens are important points that should be considered in regulatory analysis.
