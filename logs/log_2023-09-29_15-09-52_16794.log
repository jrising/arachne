> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters and information about spatial planning for activities. Prior to this report, perhaps the most comprehensive collection of materials to inform marine spatial planning is a report, “Delaware Marine Spatial Planning: Offshore Wind Context” by Bates et al., 2012. We have used this report as a partial template. Since this information is now a decade old, we have also worked to collect updated forms of the data. I would like to include a section in the report on our attempts to build upon the work of Bates et al., and I want you to develop a draft of this material. Below are two status reports on the material to inform this section. Status report 1: This makes an initial check on what datasets we wanted to ask the author (Alison Bates) about vs. which ones we could collect ourselves. We did contact Alison about their data, but decided not to ask for any datasets because of the challenges they would have in sharing the data, which would be quite old anyway. List of datasets to ask Alison about AIS Data Analysis ( Confidentially agreement with BOEM & NOAA) Traffic Separation Schemes ( TSS shape-file form AIS ? ) Anchorage Area ( ???) Commercial Fishing ( VTR from NOAA- NMFS, Confidentially agreement) Recreational Fishing ( VTR from NOAA- NMFS, Confidentially agreement) Sand Barrow Location ( USGS, methodology of extracting data is not clear) On-shore Transmission ( on demand data from Delmarva and Delaware Electric Cooperation ) Under-Sea Electricity Transmission Hub ( AWC) [ They did mention about a data request and pdf version, but I can not find anything ] Paleovalley ( McKema & Ramsey, 2002) List of datasets to collect Cold-Water Corals (NOAA/ NCEI) Essential Fish Habitat Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission ( ASMFC) [ Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program ( MAFMC) [ MRIP data from NOAA] Avian ( USGS’s Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset) Bats ( No map or dataset was mentioned in Bates et al.) I have found a dataset NABat Shipping (AIS) Artificial Reefs ( DNREC) Firing Range USACE 2005 report ( I cant find the report online) USACE 2000 report Potential Buffer Zones ( No map or dataset) Historic Places ( No map or dataset) Dump Sites ( NOAA navigational Charts) Submarine Cable ( Marine Cadastre Survey) Wind Resource ( WRF-ARW Model) Bathymetry ( NOAA/ NGDC Coastal Relief Model) Sediments ( USGS/ usSEABED) Status report 2: This is a table of what we have been able to collect. | Data | Status | Comment/Issues | | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Marine Mammals | Yes (Partial) | Shows the following error on https://seamap.env.duke.edu/species/179913: Error: Download file for the dataset is not available or stale; Data last modified: 2023-09-15 02:06:13, File timestamp: 2023-08-15 10:36:01

> # Building on the Work of Bates et al.
> 
> We embarked upon this project conscious of the pivotal effort put forth a decade prior by Bates and colleagues (Bates et al., 2012) in their comprehensive report, "Delaware Marine Spatial Planning: Offshore Wind Context". Acknowledging their informative groundwork, we commenced with a clear determination to augment their substantial dataset while preserving its fundamental structure. As part of this process, we evaluated the original datasets used by Bates et al. One part of the analysis focused on datasets we initially thought to request from Alison Bates, while the other explored data that could be independently sourced.
> 
> **Physical Geography** 
> 
> Bathymetry serves as the bedrock for maritime spatial planning. We were not able to obtain the specific bathymetry data included in the Bates report from NOAA/NGDC Coastal Relief Model. Similarly, we were unsuccessful in our attempts to obtain specific data on undersea paleovalleys and potential buffer zones. However, we managed to source sediment data, providing critical insight on substrate types and distributions, from the U.S. Geological Survey.
>   
> **Biological Resources**
> 
> Focusing on biological resources, we hit some speed bumps. The quest for data on marine mammals and sea turtles was partially successful, though errors on the cited URLs and gaps in the dataset impeded full retrieval. Notwithstanding, cold-water corals data were successfully accumulated from NOAA/NCEI while avian data was gathered from three reputable sources.
> 
> **Human Activities**
> 
> Turning to human activities, we broadened our view. For shipping, Bates et al. had utilized AIS data, which we had readily available in our repository. Data on Traffic Separation Schemes and anchorage areas were also extracted successfully. The commercial and recreational fishing data we collated mirrors that in the Bates report, albeit with several species missing due to lack of observations.
>   
> Infringement upon the marine environment has been an issue of importance in the recent years and was reflected upon in the Bates report. We were able to secure subsequent data on artificial reefs and historic places. This has broadened the outlook on changes DNArec and the National Register of Historic Places, respectively. However, data for on-shore transmission could not be updated whereas submarine cables data were successfully extracted from NOAA.
> 
> **Unresolved Areas**
> 
> Certain aspects remained unresolved. For some components like bats and dump sites, we could not locate relevant datasets. Specific on-shore transmission data and wind resource information were not procured, and the searching for paleovalleys turned up empty.
> 
> In summary, our approach has allowed for not just the preservation of the Bates et al. structure but also the enrichment of their report with our efforts. Our focus on marine spatial planning benefitted from the aforementioned updates, and even the categories with missing data can be addressed with future collections. Despite not receiving any data directly from Alison Bates, our independent data collection and analysis played a key role in the furtherance of this dataset. The task ahead involves overcoming the roadblocks to gain a comprehensive understanding of Delaware's marine spatial planning.

> 
> - Cold-Water Corals: Gathered cold-water coral data from NOAA/NCEI, specifically the Deep Sea Coral Data of the North Atlantic and South Atlantic regions. The obtained layers encompass coral-sponge locations, exclusive economic zones, GEBCO contours, national marine sanctuaries, and marine national monuments.
