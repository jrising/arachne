>     import http.cookies
> ImportError: No module named http.cookies
**assistant**:
> The error message indicates that the code is attempting to import the `http.cookies` module, which is a Python 3 module. Since you are using Python 2.7, you should be using the `Cookie` module instead.
> 
> To resolve this issue, you can modify your code to handle the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. Specifically, you can use a try-except block to import the appropriate module based on the Python version being used. Here’s an example of how to do this:
> 
> ```python
> import sys
> 
> if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
>     import http.cookies as Cookie
> else:
>     import Cookie
> ```
> 
> However, given that Python 2.7 is no longer supported and the end of life for Python 2.7 was January 1, 2020, it is highly recommended to migrate your code to Python 3 if possible. Here’s what you can do:
> 
> 1. **Upgrade to Python 3**: Update your environment to use Python 3. You can create a new virtual environment with Python 3 and install the necessary packages.
> 
>     ```bash
>     # Install virtualenv if not already installed
>     pip install virtualenv
> 
>     # Create a new virtual environment with Python 3
>     virtualenv -p python3 env
> 
>     # Activate the virtual environment
>     source env/bin/activate
> 
>     # Install the required packages
>     pip install -r requirements.txt
>     ```
> 
> 2. **Adjust Imports for Python 3**: Replace instances of `import Cookie` with `import http.cookies as Cookie` in your code.
> 
> If upgrading to Python 3 is not feasible and you need to stick with Python 2.7, ensure that you replace the import as shown in the first code block to handle the imports correctly.

> I think I just need to set the version of repoze right. But there's no repose package. When I look at my old list of versions from a working install of my software, I see these lines:
> repoze.lru==0.6
> repoze.who==2.3
> repoze.who-friendlyform==1.0.8
> 
> How do I get these?
**assistant**:
> To install the specific versions of the `repoze` packages that you listed, you can use `pip`. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. **Activate Your Virtual Environment** (if you're using one):
> 
>    If you have a virtual environment set up, make sure to activate it:
> 
>    ```bash
>    source /path/to/your/env/bin/activate
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Install the Specific Versions**:
> 
>    Use the following commands to install the required versions of the `repoze` packages:
> 
>    ```bash
>    pip install repoze.lru==0.6
>    pip install repoze.who==2.3
>    pip install repoze.who-friendlyform==1.0.8
>    ```
> 
> Alternatively, you can list all three packages in a single command using a `requirements.txt` file or directly in the pip command:
> 
> ```bash
> pip install repoze.lru==0.6 repoze.who==2.3 repoze.who-friendlyform==1.0.8
> ```
> 
> 3. **Verify Installation**:
> 
>    After installation, you can verify that the packages are correctly installed with the following command:
> 
>    ```bash
>    pip freeze
>    ```
> 
> This command will display a list of all installed packages along with their versions, allowing you to confirm that the `repoze` packages are installed at the specified versions.
