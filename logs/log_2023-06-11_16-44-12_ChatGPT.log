> Greetings! We are Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and Baby Bear, and we'd like to share our favorite porridge recipe with you. Our porridge is not too hot, not too cold, but just right! So, gather up your berries and oats, it's time to cook.
> 
> **Ingredients:**
> 
> - 1 cup of oats (you can use any variety, but we like old-fashioned rolled oats best)
> - 2 cups of water
> - A pinch of salt
> - 2 tablespoons of honey (collected responsibly from a local bee hive, of course)
> - 1/2 cup of mixed forest berries (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries - the fresher, the better)
> - 1/2 cup of almond milk (or any milk you prefer, dairy or non-dairy)
> - A sprinkle of cinnamon (optional)
> 
> **Instructions:**
> 
> 1. **Papa Bear's task:** In a large pot, combine the oats and the water. Add a pinch of salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Be careful not to burn your paws!
> 
> 2. **Mama Bear's task:** Once the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Stir it occasionally to prevent the oats from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Let it cook for about 10-15 minutes until the oats are your desired softness.
> 
> 3. **Baby Bear's task:** While the oats are simmering, wash the berries carefully. (We like to do this in a nearby stream, but a sink will do just fine). Set the berries aside to dry.
> 
> 4. **Teamwork Time:** When the oats are ready, remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the honey and almond milk, until the porridge is sweet and creamy. If it's too thick, you can add a little more milk.
> 
> 5. **Papa Bear's task:** Now it's time to add the berries. Sprinkle them on top of the porridge and give it a gentle stir.
> 
> 6. **Final Touches:** You can add a sprinkle of cinnamon on top if you like. Now let the porridge cool a bit - you wouldn't want it to be too hot!
> 
> There you have it, our favorite forest berry porridge. Just like in our story, we hope it's not too hot, not too cold, but just right for you!
