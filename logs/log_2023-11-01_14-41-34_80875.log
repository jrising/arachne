**user**:
> What is a typical rate of flow into a bathtub?
**assistant**:
> A typical bathtub faucet pours water at a rate of approximately 15-18 liters (or approximately 4-5 gallons) per minute. This flow rate can vary depending on the water pressure in your home and the type of faucet, but the aforementioned figures are common standard rates. 
> 
> Remember, this is an approximation, and if you require a more precise measurement for a specific situation, it may be worth measuring the flow rate of your specific bathtub faucet.
