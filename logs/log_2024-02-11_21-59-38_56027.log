> Can you provide summary "task" titles for each of the following paragraphs:
> Oceanographic data from EAF Nansen surveys, national surveys, satellite data and regional oceanographic models (ROMS - ref) will be combined into spatial representations of climate conditions from (2000 - 2023). These will be used as input into regional oceanographic and climate models (ref) to project oceanic and coastal climatic conditions to 2050 under the scenarios identified in WP1.
> 
> The historical status of the fish stocks will be analyzed based on scientific survey data from EAF Nansen survey, combined with national scientific surveys, national fisheries landing statistics, FAO catch statistics, CECAF assessment reports and reconstructed catch data (Sea Around Us). Projections of fish stock abundance for the next 1-2 years will be based on CECAF assessment reports, while projections of stock development until 2050 will be based on modelling (statistical, computational, assessment - TBD). 
> 
> Updated nutritional data from the commercially and nutritionally important fish and shellfish species in Senegal will be collated from the EAF Nansen programme , the FAO/INFOODS uFISH database complemented by data from the Aquatic Food Composition Database (AFCD) (Golden et al. 2021).  
> 
> Using input from WP1 future management scenarios for fisheries will be qualitatively evaluated using climate impact risk analyses as well as explored quantitatively through coupled climate-fishery-nutrition models to analyze the effects on fish stocks and nutrition under varied management actions (see Robinson et al 2022).

**assistant**:
> 1. **Combining Oceanographic Data to Project Future Climate Conditions**: The paragraph discusses how various sources of oceanographic data will be integrated into a spatial representation. This information will be used as input for oceanographic and climate models to project future coastal and oceanic climatic conditions.
> 
> 2. **Analysis and Projection of Fish Stock Status**: The paragraph illustrates how scientific survey data from numerous sources will be utilized to analyze the historical trends of fish stocks. Additionally, it discusses the use of sources for making predictions about fish stock abundance and development over the next few decades.
> 
> 3. **Collation of Updated Nutritional Data for Important Fish Species**: This paragraph relates to gathering updated nutritional data on commercially and nutritionally important fish and shellfish species in Senegal from various sources.
> 
> 4. **Evaluating Future Fisheries Management Scenarios**: The paragraph explains the qualitative and quantitative examination of future fisheries management scenarios. It discusses using coupled climate-fishery-nutrition models to analyze potential impacts under different management actions.
