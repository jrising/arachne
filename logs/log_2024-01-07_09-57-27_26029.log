**user**:
> I currently have a private TikiWiki and a public MediaWiki. I would like to merge these, while still keeping some pages public and some private. What considerations should I have about how to do that?
**assistant**:
> Merging two different Wiki platforms, specifically a private TikiWiki and a public MediaWiki, requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some crucial points to think about:
> 
> **1. Understanding the Functional Differences of Both Platforms:** 
> TikiWiki and MediaWiki are two distinct platforms, having their unique features and functionalities. While MediaWiki is great for creating open-content projects, TikiWiki offers a wide array of features beyond a conventional Wiki, including file and image galleries, forums, blogs, etc. Understand the features you want to retain or are okay to lose in the merged one.
> 
> **2. Data Migration:**
> Transferring data from one platform to another can be challenging. Both platforms use different formats for storing and representing data. It could be necessary to use a scripting approach to transform TikiWiki data into a format that can be imported into MediaWiki, or vice versa.
> 
> **3.Topics Classification:**
> Before merging, classify your current Wiki pages into public and private. It will make it easier to set the access level once the migration is done.
> 
> **4. User Rights and Privacy Management:**
> MediaWiki's default settings are not as intricate as TikiWiki when it comes to managing user rights and privacy. For keeping some pages private and others public, you'll have to set up extensions, like "Lockdown" for MediaWiki, to manage user rights and provide access based on those rights.
> 
> **5. Updating Links and Navigation:**
> When both Wikis are merged, you may need to update interlinks, navigation, and possibly refactor some pages to make the structure and flow coherent.
> 
> **6. Backup:**
> Before making any changes, it's crucial to back up your current databases for both TikiWiki and MediaWiki. If any issues occur during the transfer, you'll have a way to restore your data.
> 
> **7. Post-Migration Testing:**
> After the migration, systematic testing is required to ensure all data has been transferred correctly, and access regulations are working as expected.
> 
> In light of these considerations, you'll likely need professional help, or at least some substantial support from the online communities for both platforms. So allow time to reach out where necessary and allow for that process.
