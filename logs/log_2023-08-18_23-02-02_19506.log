> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. Several species have key habitats overlapping the planning region, according to different designations:
> 
> Biologically important area for North Atlantic Right Whale (See [1])
> Critical habitat for Atlantic Sturgeon (See [2])
> Habitat Area of Particular Concern for Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark, and Summer Flounder, as well as overlaps with two Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2 areas (Toms, Middle Toms & Hendrickson Canyons and Wilmington Canyon). (See [3])
> Essential habitat for the following highly migratory fish species (See [4]):
> Albacore Tuna
> Bigeye Tuna
> Bluefin Tuna
> Blue Marlin
> Roundscale Spearfish
> Skipjack Tuna
> Longbill spearfish
> Swordfish
> White Marlin
> Yellowfin Tuna
> 
> Essential habitat for the following highly migratory shark species (See [4]):
> 
> Atlantic Angel Shark
> Blue Shark
> Basking Shark
> Bigeye Thresher Shark
> Night Shark
> Common Thresher Shark
> Dusky Shark
> Silky Shark
> Longfin Mako Shark
> Sandbar Shark
> Shortfin Mako Shark
> Tiger Shark
> Smoothhound Shark Complex
> Atlantic Sharpnose Shark
> Sand Tiger Shark

> Here are additional details from the data sources:
> [1]: Migratory corridor biologically important areas (BIAs) for Cetaceans include areas and months within which a substantial portion of a species or population is known to migrate. BIAs were defined by compiling the best available information from scientific literature (including books, peer-reviewed articles, and government or contract reports), unpublished data (sighting, acoustic, tagging, genetic, photo identification), and expert knowledge. This information was then used to create written summaries and maps highlighting areas shoreward of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that are biologically important to Cetacean species (or populations), either seasonally or year-round. Other BIA types include feeding, reproduction, and small and resident population.
> 
> [2]: Critical habitat is defined as:
> Specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species at the time of listing that contain physical or biological features essential to conservation of the species and that  may require special management considerations or protection; and
> Specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species if the agency determines that the area itself is essential for conservation.
> [3]: A Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) is a designation that encompasses discrete subsets of Essential Fish Habitat (EFH), which provide extremely important ecological functions or are especially vulnerable to degradation. The purpose of HAPCs is to highlight priority areas within EFH to focus conservation, management, and research efforts. These areas typically possess detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability. 
> [4]: Essential Fish Habitat means those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Waters include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties that are used by fish and may include aquatic areas historically used by fish where appropriate. Substrate includes sediment, hard bottom, structures underlying the waters, and associated biological communities. Necessary means the habitat required to support a sustainable fishery and the managed species' contribution to a healthy ecosystem. Highly migratory species managed by NOAA Fisheries include tunas, some sharks, swordfish, billfish, and other highly sought-after fish such as Pacific mahi mahi.

> Sure, here's a comprehensive summary of the information you've gathered:
> 
> Delaware's marine waters serve as an expansive, multifaceted habitat platform for a diverse range of species with unique descriptions and categorizations. Distinctively, they form a "Biologically Important Area" for the North Atlantic Right Whale, a delineation based on the species' migratory behaviors and the best available scientific data. These areas are significant for the whale's seasonal or year-round feeding, reproduction, and residence routines. This region is also recognized as a "Critical Habitat" for the Atlantic Sturgeon--a designation emphasizing physical or biological features critical for the species' preservation that might demand unique management or protection measures. 
> 
> Further, these waters have been defined as a "Habitat Area of Particular Concern" for the Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark, and Summer Flounder. This suggests that these areas perform essential ecological functions or are particularly susceptible to degradation, therefore drawing attention for targeted conservation and research efforts. In addition, this region intersects with two sectors identified under the Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2: Toms, Middle Toms & Hendrickson Canyons and Wilmington Canyon.
> 
> The Delaware marine region forms an "Essential Habitat" for various highly migratory fish and shark species under NOAA's oversight, including but not limited to Albacore Tuna, Blue Marlin, Swordfish, and the Basking Shark. These habitats contribute significantly to these species' life cycles including spawning, breeding, feeding, and maturing, and even incorporate historical aquatic areas and the associated physical, chemical, and biological elements. The region's vitality underpins sustainable fisheries and fosters a healthy ecosystem, reiterating the importance of comprehensive management efforts to ensure these species' enduring contributions to the biodiversity of Delaware's marine waters.
