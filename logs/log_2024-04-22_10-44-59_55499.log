> Can you construct a mapping from each of the CV disciplines to one of the disciplines on the survey of earned doctorates? Please include the number associated with each CV discipline.
**assistant**:
> Certainly, generating such a mapping is a complex task, as it will require careful interpretation of both the specific discipline titles as well as their underlying implications. Here is an abbreviated example of how these mappings might look:
> 
> 1. [162] "Government and Social Policy" -> "Political science and government"
> 2. [163] "Graduate School of Business" -> "Business administration and management"
> 3. [164] "Health Education" -> "Public health"
> 4. [165] "History" -> "History"
> 5. [166] "Hominid Paleobiology" -> "Anthropology"
> 6. [167] "Hospitality Management" -> "Non-science and engineering, other"
> 7. [168] "Human Development and Social Policy with a Certificate in Education Sciences" -> "Education research"
> 8. [169] "Human Evolutionary Ecology and Anthropology" -> "Anthropology"
> 9. [170] "Hydrogeology" -> "Geological and earth sciences"
> 10. [199] "Marine Bioscience" -> "Ocean, marine, and atmospheric sciences"
> 11. [200] "Marine Geology & Geophysics" -> "Ocean, marine, and atmospheric sciences"
> 12. [205] "Materials Science and Engineering" -> "Materials sciences"
> 13. [207] "Mathematics" -> "Mathematics"
> 14. [208] "Mechanical Engineering" -> "Mechanical engineering"
> 15. [221] "Oceanography" -> "Ocean, marine, and atmospheric sciences"
> 16. [235] "Philosophy" -> "Philosophy and religious studies"
> 17. [284] "Social Sciences" -> "Sociology, demography, and population studies"
> 18. [286] "Social/Organizational Psychology" -> "Research and experimental psychology"
> 19. [287] "Sociology" -> "Sociology, demography, and population studies"
> 20. [295] "Sustainability" -> "Natural resources and conservation"
> 21. [302] "United States history" -> "History"
> 
> Please note, the CV disciplines often denote more specific domains within the more general categories of the survey of earned doctorates. I used my best judgment to match them to the most relevant discipline listed in the survey, so some interpretations could be open to debate. The entire mapping from the CV disciplines to the survey disciplines would be quite extensive, and could involve obtaining additional clarifications regarding some of the less apparent CV disciplines.
