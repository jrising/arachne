> I am setting up a website and I will be getting an https certificate. Can the same certificate apply to all subdomains?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can apply the same SSL certificate to all subdomains, but you need to use a specific type of certificate called a Wildcard SSL certificate. 
> 
> A Wildcard SSL certificate allows you to secure your main domain along with all its subdomains. When issued, it will be in the format of `*.yourdomain.com`, where the asterisk (*) represents any valid subdomain. With a Wildcard certificate, you can add or change subdomains without needing to acquire a new certificate. 
> 
> Remember to ensure your hosting provider supports wildcard certificates, and consider your needs carefully as Wildcard certificates can be more expensive than single domain certificates.
