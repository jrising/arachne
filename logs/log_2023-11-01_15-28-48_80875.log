**user**:
> Is there a term for all of the buildings in an urban setting? Infrastructure seems too broad.
**assistant**:
> Yes, the term for all of the buildings in an urban setting is often referred to as the "built environment." This term encompasses all human-made resources and infrastructure designed to support human activity, including buildings, parks, and transportation systems. However, if you are specifically referring only to residential, commercial, and institutional buildings, without other aspects of urban infrastructure, you might simply use the term "urban buildings" or "urban architecture."
