**assistant**:
> Yes, with Flowbite, a utility first CSS framework based on Tailwind CSS, you can easily set up a side panel next to a larger content window using the CSS Grid or Flexbox utilities. Here's a way to do it:
> 
> ```html
> <div class="grid grid-cols-[1fr,3fr] gap-4">
>   <!-- Sidebar -->
>   <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
>     <!-- Your sidebar content goes here -->
>   </div>
> 
>   <!-- Main content -->
>   <div class="bg-white p-4">
>     <!-- Your main content goes here -->
>   </div>
> </div>
> ```
> 
> In the above snippet, `grid-cols-[1fr,3fr]` defines a grid with two columns. The first column (your sidebar) will take up 1 fraction of the available space, and the second column (your larger content window) will take up 3 fractions. This way, your sidebar will be narrower than the main content area.
