> As Delaware vigorously progresses towards renewable energy, significant wind planning is underway off its marine waters. Two noteworthy proposals come from companies US Wind and Ørsted. US Wind proposes 76 turbines, measuring between 817 and 938 feet high, to cover roughly 80,000 acres of marine space. These turbines would be located about 24 miles from Dewey Beach and about 26.2 miles from Rehoboth. On a parallel note, Ørsted's Skipjack Wind proposes around 70 turbines to be positioned about 20 miles off the Delaware coast. The forthcoming 966-megawatt wind farm from Ørsted is projected to generate sufficient electricity to power approximately 300,000 homes, with operational power delivery targeted for 2026. Cable landings for these wind farms are projected to be near Rehoboth Beach and along the Delaware Seashore State Park. The fruition of these activities would underscore an enormous stride towards a sustainable, renewable future in Delaware.
