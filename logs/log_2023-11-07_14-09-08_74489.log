> Estimating Current Climate Losses - Project Proposal
> PI: James Rising, University of Delaware
> 
> Context: The planet has already warmed by 1.34 Â°C [1.2 - 1.5 Â°C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. Under one expert review of global damages, this suggests that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion. In poor, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be significantly greater.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> Deliverable: This project will develop best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome will be percent reductions in GDP per capita and percent reductions in capital wealth, in 2023, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP per capita is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels. A recent estimate of GDP losses, combining three of these results and produced by the PI for a previous ECF-funded project on the cost of climate change in the UK, is shown below.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses will provide new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change. The losses would also be reported as a global average and for various regional and country groups (e.g., LLMICs, G77, Sub-Saharan Africa).
> 
> Annually varying loss estimates will underlie these results, which will reflect greater losses in years with heat waves and in later years as climate change accelerates. We will develop short case studies from the EU and LLMICs will compare these GDP losses to other reported impacts of recent heat waves.
> 
> The estimates will be produced as part of a short report made initially available to the sponsors Nov. 1, 2023, and for release during COP 28. The work will then be prepared for academic publication.
> 
> Unique contribution: To produce these results, we bring together existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate (see Table under Points of Methodology). Over the past decade, this literature has proposed many different approaches to understanding the effect of climate on GDP, including investigations of the differential vulnerability of poor countries, the role of persistent losses to growth, and the potential of adaptation. Current attempts to synthesise this literature are limited to simply averaging the results. Using a machine learning model, calibrated to the results from this literature, we will produce an estimate that reflects the most advanced features of all of these papers.

> The sophistication and complexity of our machine learning model, is its ability to assimilate and integrate nuances from a broad swath of different models. For each combination of country, year, and Monte Carlo draw, a random forest model is fit using the available DirectImpact data. This DirectImpact value quantifies the effect of climate change on economic indicators. 
> 
> Each attribute of this dataset, representative of varying methodologies employed in the background research, is translated into a quality value on a scale of 0 to 1. This translation includes assigning a weight to a model attribute based on the category it falls under. The attributes encapsulate diverse aspects of the models spanning weather weighting, temperature effects, precipitation effects, control factors, lagged growth and so forth.
> 
> For instance, models that use a population-weighted measure for weather get a higher quality score, while those that do not are assigned a lower score. Similarly, models interacting with rich and poor economies are deemed higher quality. A diverse database of models that use different approaches to calculate the temperature effect is included. The quality score calculation mechanism varies across different attributes. In some cases, we assign the highest quality score to advanced methodologies (such as quadratic, interaction with average temperature etc.), and in others, we merely verify whether a particular attribute is present or not.
> 
> Once this quality scoring is completed for each model, the dataset is prepared to move into the crucial phase of random forest modeling. We request the DirectImpact value from the random forest model, which represents a model in the database for which each of those quality values is 1. This provides us with the optimal prediction for the direct impact of climate change.
