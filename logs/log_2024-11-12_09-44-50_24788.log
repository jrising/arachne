> Can you incorporate into these some of our "main insights":
>  - Delawareâ€™s coastal economy has grown 5x faster than the entire stateâ€™s economy since 2011.
>  - Coastal economy supports 104,540 jobs across Delaware. That amounts to 30,510 jobs outside of DE coastal areas.
>  - The State of Delaware receives an estimated $820 million in tax revenue from coastal activities when accounting for broader economic effects.
>  - For every $100 of annual revenue in the coastal region, an additional $59 in revenue is earned throughout the state. This amounts to $8.3 billion  in revenue annually.
> 
> You can also highlight that this means that the whole state benefits when coastal risks (like flooding) are better managed, and that many coastal risks are best managed at a state or regional level.
