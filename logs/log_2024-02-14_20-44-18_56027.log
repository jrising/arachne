**user**:
> Does "overheads" include both fringe and F&A?
**assistant**:
> Yes, usually "overheads" in a budget plan includes both fringe benefits and Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs. 
> 
> - Fringe benefits include employee-related expenses like health insurance, retirement benefits, social security, etc.
> - F&A costs, also known as indirect costs or overhead, include costs incurred for common or joint objectives that cannot be easily identified with a specific project. This typically includes expenses for operations like utilities, administrative services, maintenance, etc.
> 
> These costs are often calculated as a percentage of the total direct costs (salaries, equipment, materials, etc.) of a project. The specific percentages can vary by organization and by the type of project.
