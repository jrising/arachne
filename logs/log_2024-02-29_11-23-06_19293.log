**user**:
> When I was a kid, I remember my parents or teachers making a lot of the fact that the US has "open borders". Does that mean that we used to not patrol them, or treated undocumented migrants differently?
**assistant**:
> When people refer to the U.S. as having "open borders," they typically do not mean that the U.S. had completely unpatrolled borders and unrestricted immigration; that there was no immigration enforcement or that anyone could come and go freely without any checks or restrictions. Instead, the term "open borders" has been used in different contexts and can mean different things to different people.
> 
> Historically, before the late 19th century, it could indeed be said the U.S. had "open borders" in the sense that there were few if any federal laws or regulations that concerned immigration, largely because immigration was seen as beneficial for a fast-growing country. The first significant immigration restriction in the U.S. came with the Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which were targeted against specific groups.
> 
> However, it is important to remember that even without many formal restrictions, the journey to the U.S. was difficult and dangerous, limiting the number of people who could make the trip. Most of the settlers were drawn from fairly narrow demographic and geographic pools.
> 
> After this point, and particularly throughout the 20th century, various changes to U.S. law and policy gradually built up a system of immigration restriction and enforcement, including patrolling the border, that would be recognizable to us today. However, this system has always been controversial and is often a significant point of debate in U.S. politics.
> 
> In the context of your childhood memories, it may be that your parents or teachers were emphasizing values such as international cooperation, the exchange of ideas, the welcoming of refugees and the importance of the U.S. as a nation of immigrants. The concept of "open borders" could also have been used metaphorically or symbolically to highlight these concepts.
> 
> In any case, it's certainly true that attitudes and policies toward undocumented migrants have shifted over time, sometimes welcoming and at other times hostile, depending on a number of factors including political climate, demographic trends, economic conditions, and national security concerns.
> 
> As of now, the U.S. does not have fully "open borders." It has a comprehensive system of immigration enforcement, which includes both border patrols and various forms of interior enforcement. However, debates over this system continue, with some advocating for more open policies and others for more restriction. As with many issues in U.S. history, the question of "open borders" is complex and multifaceted.
