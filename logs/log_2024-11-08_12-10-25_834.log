**assistant**:
> Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a basic plan for growing membership for your business engagement programs and keeping current members engaged and appreciated.
> 
> 1. **Current Member Appreciation and Cohesion:**
>    * Create an ongoing member recognition program that highlights their successes or contributions in a monthly newsletter, on your website or during events.
>    * Use a tiered loyalty program to reward member engagement. Encourage more participation or commitment with special privileges, such as sneak peaks at upcoming events or strategic materials.
>    * Organize virtual or in-person networking events for CEOs and other high-level members, where they can share experiences and insights.
>    * Provide current members with high-quality educational content. This can be through members-only webinars, write-ups of cutting-edge research, or guest speakers at meetings.
> 
> 2. **New Member Acquisition:**
>    * Tailor your marketing messages to address the pain points or goals of your target members. Showcase the tangible benefits of joining your program.
>    * Leverage the power of social proof by highlighting testimonials and case studies from successful and happy current members.
>    * Use a referral program to encourage current members to bring in their peers. This could be incentivized by giving them a membership discount on their next subscription or an exclusive opportunity to an invite-only event.
>    * Engage with potential new members at industry conferences or gatherings, both in person or virtually.
> 
> 3. **Green Lease Leaders Program:**
>    * Promote the value of the Green Lease by showcasing success stories and case studies. Encourage members to adopt Green Leases and recognize their efforts.
>    * Organize educational events or workshops tailored towards understanding and navigating Green Leases.
> 
> 4. **Expanding the DC Hub:**
>    * Create a targeted outreach list of businesses that have operations in the DC area and would benefit from DC Hubâ€™s offering.
>    * Collaborate with other businesses and community leaders in DC to host events, panel discussions, or workshops, boosting your network and visibility.
> 
> 5. **CEO Engagement:**
>    * Encourage more CEOs to join the program by showcasing the strategic benefits that other CEO members have reaped.
>    * As CEOs often act on peer-recommendations, facilitate peer-to-peer outreach, or invite them to an exclusive CEO roundtable event to see the value firsthand.
> 
> 6. **Metrics for Success:**
>    * Determine your success metrics, like a number of new sign-ups, event registrations, active member percentage, renewal rates, etc. This way you will be able to see which tactics work best and where improvements can be made.
>    
> Remember, the key to membership growth is to offer value and ensure your members receive tangible benefits, be that networking opportunities, educational content, or business help. Also, ensure you celebrate your members, not just focus on recruitment. An appreciated member is a loyal member.
