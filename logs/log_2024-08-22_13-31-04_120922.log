> The Institute for Market Transformation Supports Midwestern Governments, Community-based Organizations, and other Stakeholders through Federal Funding, Utility, and Engagement Technical and Strategic Assistance 
> Introduction: 
> The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) is dedicated to supporting Midwestern governments, community-based organizations, and stakeholders in accessing federal funding, utility, and engagement resources for building decarbonization initiatives. This proposal outlines IMT’s plan to establish a comprehensive federal funding technical assistance program specifically tailored to accelerate decarbonization efforts in the Midwest region.
> 
> Program Overview: 
> IMT’s proposed technical assistance program aims to address the critical need highlighted by the McKnight Foundation for streamlined support in facilitating access to federal funding opportunities for building decarbonization projects. The program will cater to community-based organizations (CBOs), local and state governments, and other stakeholders, providing them with essential resources and guidance to navigate the complex landscape of federal funding mechanisms.
> 
> Key Components of the Program:
> Compilation of Funding Opportunity Databases:
> Develop and maintain a user-friendly dashboard of federal funding opportunities pertinent to building decarbonization in the Midwest.
> Include crucial details such as eligibility criteria, deadlines, award amounts, and application requirements.
> Regularly update the database to reflect new funding opportunities as they arise.
> 
> Relevant Application Support:
> Provide hands-on assistance in navigating the application processes for federal funding opportunities.
> Conduct grant writing workshops tailored to building-related funding opportunities.
> Offer comprehensive review and feedback on draft applications to enhance competitiveness.
> 
> Stakeholder Engagement:
> Reach out to community groups and organizations actively involved in building-related issues.
> Conduct surveys and interviews annually to assess the technical assistance needs of stakeholders.
> Develop targeted resources and support based on identified gaps in knowledge and skills.
> 
> Resource Development:
> Create templates, checklists, and guides to streamline the application process.
> Develop case studies showcasing Midwest projects that have secured federal funding.
> Produce a monthly newsletter highlighting relevant funding opportunities and providing valuable tips and insights.
> 
> In Coordination with Minneapolis Hub: (Julia’s part)
> Integrate federal funding technical assistance seamlessly into the existing services offered by the Minneapolis Hub.
> Utilize Hub partnerships to disseminate information, resources, and promote collaboration among stakeholders.
> Identify and leverage synergies between Hub activities and federal funding pursuits to maximize impact.
> Host Quarterly Roundtables:
> Host regular convenings to share program updates, encourage collaboration, and gather feedback from stakeholders.
> Invite representatives from federal agencies to present on priority funding areas and address any queries from participants.
> 
> Staffing and Budget: Estimated Annual Budget: $200,000 (where do you typically put this? above) 
> 
> Collaboration Opportunities: 
> While IMT acknowledges the importance of consistent technical assistance for environmental justice interventions at the PUC, we currently lack the capacity to take on this role. However, our local partner, Community Power, has expressed interest in collaborating with IMT to provide the needed support in this area.IMT is committed to furthering its work in the Midwest region, including ongoing projects such as community climate shift initiatives, franchise fee programs, and collaborative efforts in Chicago.
> 
> Conclusion: 
> IMT’s proposed technical assistance program for building decarbonization in the Midwest is poised to significantly enhance the region’s capacity to access federal funding opportunities, drive sustainable development, and accelerate progress towards a decarbonized future. By strengthening partnerships, sharing knowledge, and fostering collaboration, IMT aims to create a more resilient and sustainable built environment in the Midwest region.

> 
> Prep Questions
> 1) What do we know about the funder’s interests/priorities and how do we align? Are there any specific connections we can draw?
> McKnight’s goal is to “advance a more just, creative, and abundant future where people and planet thrive.” They focus on the midwest with focus areas including arts and culture, climate and energy, and vibrant and equitable communities.
> McKnight gave us 50k to “deploy the Building Performance Partnership model for federal funding technical assistance to Minneapolis and St. Paul for applications that will support their equitable decarbonization goals.” 
> Two main connection points we want to draw are: 
> Current status of Minneapolis/St.Paul Hub needs assessment: 
> Conducting interviews with community-serving organizations and traditional building/ energy industry to gain understanding of level community needs incorporated into support for high-performance buildings and where there needs to be additional support for high performance buildings in general
> Conducted benchmarking analysis for 2023 based on data
> Working with new sustainability program coordinator at the City of Minneapolis - helping them build relationships with local organizations 
> Currently also mapping city, utility support programs and incentives - where people currently getting support
> Will conduct survey as next phase after interviews and further research on available financial incentives, support programs, equity considerations 
> Federal Funding with the Hub:
> RECI Hubs application
> Total ask: $9,752,730
> Funding for Minneapolis Hub: around $200k, plus the IMT supports
> Lead on this application, coordinated with Minneapolis government officials to build them into the proposal 
> Can send them the technical volume as follow up
> Summary: 
> Launch and support Building Energy Resource Hubs to provide tailored resources to jurisdictions, building owners, and other stakeholders navigating implementation and compliance with building decarbonization policies.
> Building on the success of the existing Building Performance Partnership network of hubs and work conducted in accordance with Supporting Equitable Building Performance (funded under the first round of RECI), the project team will: 1. Create high-performance building hubs in new locations; 2. Develop and deploy new training resources and education via hubs in existing locations; 3. Provide workforce development support focused on small, minority-owned businesses interested in supporting high-performance buildings; and 4. Launch Vendor Matchmaking portals to connect local businesses to jobs.
> 
> Minnesota IRA codes (internal only intake form summary)
> Total ask: 10M
> Focuses on improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions in existing large commercial and multifamily buildings through BPS. The goal is to get the Minnesota Legislature to adopt a BPS in the 2025 session.
> Supported this application by having meetings with Center for Energy and Environment and state govt leaders, reviewed materials and provided feedback, did the impact calculators, reviewed and helped write comments for the response
> Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund:
> Part of Climate Justice Fund, which won almost one billion dollars in Clean Communities Investment Accelerator funding
> Minnesota is part of states we’re hoping to support through Invest in Our Future grant funding (help support further federal funding come to Minneapolis hopefully but at least Minnesota)
> Still negotiating bid so we can’t promise anything but BPP is the key mechanism for our work   
> 2) What is a realistic outcome for the meeting? 
> Dolkar sent the following text to Julia about her agenda for the meeting: 
> “1) general update on last mcknight grant since it was a one time thing.
> 2) imt building work
> 3) chat about your capacity and your work in mn/ interest.” 
> Our goal is to understand what she means by a one time thing and present other options for funding. Then we want to learn next steps for cultivation. This was incubation funding for one year that includes how we ware going to get funding in the future. 
> Secondary ask: Connect our work with Groundbreak Coalition’s priorities and figure out a way to fund our support
> only way to get Groundbreak Coalition funding is through McKnight
> 3) Based on what we know of the funder’s priorities, what should be our top three message points?
> IMT supports Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state of Minnesota with federal funding opportunities. Outside of Minnesota, we are also supporting Kansas City, Chicago, St. Louis on funding opps and building those relationships. 
> The Hub is a critical support for moving federal funding forward. Hubs are connectors and TA experts. Can support both the city and real estate stakeholders to move climate and energy projects forward
> Our investment in Minneapolis is growing outside of the Hubs as well. Talk about SEBP which just brought on ISAIAH with Alexa Howart, co-executive director signing the RFP (current McKnight grantee), partnership with Community Power and Just Transition Fund coalition, advising City of Minneapolis staff and elected officials on franchise negotiations, participation in BPS legislation stakeholder meetings?  Julia is interested in working on gas transition work too.
> 4) What questions do we think the funder might pose to us and how will we respond?
> What is our plan for the election? We are scenario planning and prioritizing federal funding efforts. Here is an INTERNAL document with our election scenario plan we can summarize but not share a link for. 
> biggest point here is, we are helping cities and states make the most of federal funding opportunities now by providing ta, summarizing opportunities, etc
> What are our plans for the Hub next year?
> Pending RECI 2 announcement - would have funding to do business plan, finalize host of Hub and launch with starter kit of resources, website and training for the region shared across Hubs - join BPP network
> Seek funding for business plan or discuss with City right partner for hub and work with partner on finding funding for hub launch / work with City on funding mechanisms
> How will we financially support the Hub outside of McKnight?
> RECI 2 goal
> Hub needs assessment and business plan map out funding streams
> 
> 5)  What questions can we ask that will engage the funder as a thought partner and help us get to know them better? Write at least 3.
> What are they hearing about the election and how are their grantees preparing? (if it comes up)
> What are Dolkar’s biggest priorities in the next year? Do you envision us having a role in your priorities? ex utility work? 
> How is the relationship with Groundbreak going? What successes are they having and what challenges are they facing? 
> 6) What are specific next steps you can offer at the end of the meeting? Write a couple of ideas.
> Follow up with any collateral we mentioned/make any connections we mentioned
> Offer to check in in September with more updates, and to let her know when RECI 2 will be announced
> Offer to send the technical volume
> Notes from meeting: 
> Dolkar feels that  McKnight building portfolio underdeveloped and disorganized
> NBI was funded for really technical and now shift for general grant
> CCS first pitch was at the same time of EBF but now that CCS has grown more Dolkar wants to learn more about it
> McKnight putting in money into TCTAC but still hearing groups still need grant writers - Reimbursement rate is a challenge; giving administrative support….this isn’t inclusive of buildings
> Dolkar would like to know a group/org that’s already doing this on the building side.  she doesn’t even have a clear list of building grant opportunities for community groups
> PUC - Dolkar is hearing from grantees that there isn’t enough interveners and commenters at the PUC. Julia shared that compared to other PUC’s, MN has a fair amount. 
> SEED went from 4 to 14 staff; we can’t have EJ groups screaming EJ - they need the technical modeling - Could SEED be a leader? Do people see this? Would Roxanne agree to this?
> EJ is missing  in the groups that intervene regularly; Stacy at the City would play this role, but unsure if the next person at the city will take this on. Community Power, SEE, and (name that I forget) - 
> Send follow up with CCS summary, CCS partner list, GGRF support, Community Power paper, and midwest hub link examples
