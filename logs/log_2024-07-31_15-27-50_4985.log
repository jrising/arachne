> In Shiny, how can I programmatically add new names to `output$`? I have four plots I want to make, and they're identical except for subsets of the data, so I want to just do a loop that creates all four and adds them all under different names.

> In Shiny, the `output` object is reactive and can manage dynamic UI elements, including plots. You can't directly add to `output` with a loop because `output` is an environment that expects named elements. However, you can dynamically create these elements using `outputOptions` and reactive expressions with `renderPlot`. Here's an example of how you can do this for four plots:
> 
> ```r
> library(shiny)
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Sample data
> data <- data.frame(
>   category = rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), each = 25),
>   value = rnorm(100)
> )
> 
> # Define UI
> ui <- fluidPage(
>   lapply(1:4, function(i) {
>     plotOutput(outputId = paste0("plot", i))
>   })
> )
> 
> # Define server logic
> server <- function(input, output) {
>   for (i in 1:4) {
>     local({
>       j <- i # localize the variable to avoid loop scoping issues
>       output[[paste0("plot", j)]] <- renderPlot({
>         ggplot(data[data$category == LETTERS[j],], aes(x = value)) +
>           geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
>           ggtitle(paste("Category", LETTERS[j]))
>       })
>     })
>   }
> }
> 
> # Run the application
> shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
> ```

> 1. **UI Definition**:
>    - `lapply` is used to create multiple `plotOutput` elements with IDs `"plot1"`, `"plot2"`, `"plot3"`, and `"plot4"`.
>    
> 2. **Server Logic**:

>    - The `local` function ensures that `j` retains its value within the reactive expression, avoiding issues with R's loop scoping.
