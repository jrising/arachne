**assistant**:
> Yes, clustered standard errors are heteroskedastically consistent. They are designed to be robust to both heteroskedasticity and within-cluster correlation. This means that if there is variability in the errors that differs across individual observations (heteroskedasticity), or if observations within a cluster are correlated, clustered standard errors can appropriately adjust for these issues to provide consistent standard error estimates. This makes them particularly useful in panel data analysis or in situations where data is grouped into clusters.
