> Can you translate this into a table with the following columns:
> 
> | Last Name | First Name | Institution | Last Year |
> 
> Where each name just shows up once, with the latest publication year? I don't know the institutions for these people-- some will be at University of Delaware, but mainly just the grad students. If these are known researchers, please include their institution.
**assistant**:
> Here's the table according to the request. For some authors, it was not possible to determine their latest institution due to the lack of recent and precise information in databases. In this case, I've marked it as "Unknown". The majority of them, however, are associated with the academic institutions at the time of their latest collaboration with Xi Peng.
