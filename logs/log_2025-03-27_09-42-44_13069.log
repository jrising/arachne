> Hello Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope you are doing well! My name is Sarah Stafford and I am an applicant for the Master of Marine Policy program beginning this fall. My application reference number is 893189475. I contacted the admissions office to check on my application status and they recommended that I reach out to professors whose work best aligns with my research interests because of the structure of funding and admissions in the department.
> 
> I found your research to be incredibly interesting, especially your work related to estimating damages caused by climate change. I would be delighted to learn from and apply your expertise to my interest in noise pollution produced by shipping vessels. I am interested in valuing the loss of wildlife as a consequence of noise pollution, potentially in terms of carbon sequestration. Additionally, I hope to expand on existing literature on the mitigation of costs related to reduced vessel speed and improved vessel design with the use of incentive-based measures.
> 
> If it would be helpful, I would be happy to set up a time to chat more about your research and expand on my academic interests. Additionally, if you have any updates on the admissions process, I would be happy to hear.
> 
> Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you!

> Best,

> Dear Sarah,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in my research. I'm glad to hear about your passion for exploring the intersection of climate change impacts and noise pollution from shipping vessels.
> 
> Unfortunately, there are no funded positions available within the Marine Policy program this year. However, we are discussing the possibility of admitting students who are able to self-fund their studies, which would mean being responsible for all tuition costs.
> 
> If self-funding is an option you are open to, please let me know, and we can proceed from there. Additionally, if you wish to discuss your research interests further, feel free to schedule a time for a Zoom conversation at [this link](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).
