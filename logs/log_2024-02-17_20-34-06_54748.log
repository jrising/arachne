**user**:
> Delaware has this practice of permitting individuals to gain permits to drive on state beaches, park and "surf" fishing. But looking at pictures, I didn't see where people were fishing from. Are they fishing from their trucks? If not, why are they driving their trucks up on the beach?
**assistant**:
> In the state of Delaware, surf fishing, or beach casting, involves shore-based fishing where anglers cast their bait or lure into the surf. The practice of driving and parking vehicles on the beach is directed more toward convenience than necessity.
> 
> Vehicles are generally used for transport of fishing gear, which can be quite heavy when you consider the rods, reels, bait, tackle, and perhaps a cooler for refreshments or preserving caught fish. Having a vehicle nearby can make it easier to move between different fishing spots along the coast, depending on where the fish are biting.
> 
> Upon arriving at a spot, anglers typically exit their vehicles and set up their equipment on the shore, fishing from the beach itself- not from their trucks. The vehicles also often serve as a base of operations -- a place to store gear, shelter from weather, and a spot to relax when not actively fishing.
> 
> However, this practice is regulated to protect the beach environment. In Delaware, to drive on the beach for surf fishing, you do need a permit, and there are rules that must be followed to minimize the environmental impact. These may include restrictions on tire type, maintaining a low speed, and avoiding driving on the dunes. Also, every vehicle on the beach for this purpose is required to be actively engaged in fishing.
> 
> While this makes for a more comfortable fishing experience, there continues to be a dialogue about how to ensure these activities are conducted in a way that minimally impacts the beach and marine environment.
