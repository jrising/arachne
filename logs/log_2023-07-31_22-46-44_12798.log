> I want to research the effect that a transition to a hydrogen economy would have on households within different income groups. I'm concerned about two main pieces of this. First, the way I'm thinking about this, I would need an I/O model, but data for these cost a lot of money. Can I model the propagation of sectoral changes in economy using free data? Second, do such I/O models have distinct income groups that I can study?

> **1. Free Input-Output (I/O) Model Data:**
> 
> While it's true that some proprietary I/O models, databases and analytics software can be quite expensive, several free or public sources of comprehensive economic data are available that you can leverage to construct your own I/O model. 
> 
> - The first is from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/industry/index.htm#tables), which provides detailed industry-by-industry and commodity-by-commodity data on the U.S. economy. You'll find transaction tables (Use, Make, Direct Requirements, and Total Requirements) for a detailed list of sectors. 
> 
> - Similarly, [EUROSTAT](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/esa-supply-use-input-tables/data/database) and [OECD's STAN input-output](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/stan.htm) databases cover the European and other OECD economies, respectively, and are freely available. 
> 
> - You might also want to look into the [World Input-Output Database (WIOD)](http://www.wiod.org/home), which provides open access to time series of world input-output tables, environmental data, and socio-economic data.
> 
> **2. Income Groups in I/O Models:**
> 
> Standard I/O models, unfortunately, do not generally differentiate between income groups; they tend to model the economy as a whole, and their primary focus is the interaction between industry sectors. 
> 
> However, you could integrate I/O modelling with microsimulation or CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) models that incorporate household-level data, let you model distinct income groups, and analyse distributional outcomes. 
> 
> This hybrid approach might involve using the I/O model findings - industry and sector level impacts of transitioning to a hydrogen economy - as inputs into the microsimulation or CGE model. This could reveal how these macroeconomic changes propagate at the household level, across different income groups, and capture policies' distributional effects.
> 
> A potential source of household income and expenditure data is the [Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/) from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Microsimulation models often use this type of survey data.
> 
> As for software, the GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) is frequently used for building CGE models, and there are numerous public models available, which can provide starting points for your own model. Additional household-level data sources, enabling you to differentiate households by income or other characteristics, could come from national or regional socio-economic surveys (making sure the data is suitable for your geographical area of research).
> 
> Having said that, creation and analysis of such hybrid models are intricate and require considerable expertise. Do you need guidance on training materials or additional expert advice for these types of models, James?
