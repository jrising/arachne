**assistant**:
> This concept is often referred to as "economic development policy" or "fiscal impact analysis." In particular, when a government attempts to design policy to capture the fiscal benefits of its investments, it can also be referred to as "investment-driven economic policy" or "return on investment (ROI) policy design." These approaches aim to ensure that the government's expenditure leads to tangible economic benefits, such as increased tax revenues, job creation, or overall economic growth. The focus is on creating a positive cycle where government spending results in economic growth, which in turn generates more fiscal revenue.
