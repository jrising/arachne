> Was 9/11 an inside job?
**assistant**:
> There is no credible evidence to suggest that the events of September 11, 2001, were an "inside job." The 9/11 attacks were extensively investigated by various entities, including the 9/11 Commission, which was set up by the United States Congress.
> 
> The Commission's final report, published in 2004, concluded that the attacks were the result of a failure by the U.S. government to recognize and respond to a series of warnings about the threat posed by Al-Qaeda, and not a conspiracy within the U.S. government.
> 
> This conclusion is supported by multiple independent investigations conducted by news organizations, academics, and other experts. Therefore, claims that 9/11 was an "inside job" are not supported by the preponderance of evidence and are considered conspiracy theories.
