> Can I translate a log-likelihood coming out of a least-squares analysis into an R2?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can approximate the coefficient of determination (\( R^2 \)) from the log-likelihood in a least-squares analysis. Here's a general method you can use:
> 
> 1. **Calculate the Total Variance (\( SS_{\text{tot}} \)):**
>    The total sum of squares (variation in the dependent variable):
>    \[
>    SS_{\text{tot}} = \sum_{i} (y_i - \bar{y})^2
>    \]
>    where \( y_i \) is the observed value, and \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the observed values.
> 
> 2. **Calculate the Residual Variance (\( SS_{\text{res}} \)):**
>    The residual sum of squares (variation unexplained by the model):
>    \[
>    SS_{\text{res}} = \sum_{i} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
>    \]
>    where \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value from the model.
> 
> 3. **Compute the \( R^2 \) Value:**
>    \[
>    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}
>    \]
> 
> If you have the log-likelihood of the model, you can use it to estimate \( SS_{\text{res}} \):
> 
> ### Approximation Method:
> - For a normally distributed error term, the log-likelihood can be written as:
>   \[
>   \log \mathcal{L} = -\frac{n}{2} (\log(2\pi) + \log(\sigma^2) + 1)
>   \]
>   where \( n \) is the number of observations, and \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance of the errors.
> 
> - The residual sum of squares \( SS_{\text{res}} \) relates to the variance:
>   \[
>   SS_{\text{res}} = n \sigma^2
>   \]
> 
> Given the log-likelihood:
> \[
> \log \mathcal{L} = -\frac{n}{2} (\log(2\pi) + \log(SS_{\text{res}}/n) + 1)
> \]
> 
> You can solve for \( SS_{\text{res}} \):
> \[
> SS_{\text{res}} = n \exp \left( -\frac{2}{n} \log \mathcal{L} - \log(2\pi) - 1 \right)
> \]
> 
> With \( SS_{\text{res}} \) determined, you can then compute \( R^2 \) using the earlier steps. 
> 
> ### Summarized Steps:
> 1. Determine \( SS_{\text{tot}} \) directly from your data.
> 2. Use the log-likelihood to solve for \( SS_{\text{res}} \) using:
>    \[
>    SS_{\text{res}} = n \exp \left( -\frac{2}{n} \log \mathcal{L} - \log(2\pi) - 1 \right)
>    \]
> 3. Calculate \( R^2 \) as:
>    \[
>    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}
>    \]
