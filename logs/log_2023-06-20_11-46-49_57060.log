> 
> •	Purpose: The purpose of the study is to understand how individuals, community organizations, and companies use the Delaware ocean and bay, or may use it in the future. We are particularly interested the information that individuals and groups rely on to engage in ocean and bay-related activities.
> 
> •	Procedures: If you choose to participate, you will be asked to respond to a structured series of questions. If we engage with you in-person or in a phone or video conference, we will also include an unstructured segment to the discussion.

**assistant**:
> Based on your project description, I suggest making slight adjustments to the purpose and procedures sections and providing content for the risks and benefits sections as follows:
> 
> • Purpose: The purpose of the study is to explore the ways individuals, community organizations, and companies use or plan to use the waters of the Delaware ocean and bay, especially focusing on the types of information they rely on to participate in ocean and bay-related activities.
> 
> • Procedures: If you agree to participate, you will be asked to respond to a set of structured questions designed to understand your use of the waters and your experiences with relevant information. If we engage with you in-person or through a phone or video conference, we will also include a less formal segment of the discussion to gather additional insights.
> 
> • Risks: The primary risk or discomfort from this research is the potential for sharing personal or sensitive information about your experiences. To minimize this risk, participation is entirely voluntary, and you may choose not to answer any question or withdraw from the study at any time. Your responses will be kept confidential, and any personal identifiers will be removed from the data before analysis.
> 
> • Benefits: The main benefit to you from participating in this research is the opportunity to share your unique perspective on the use of ocean and bay waters, which will contribute to a better understanding of current and future needs of stakeholders within the Delaware watershed. Your participation may potentially influence decisions and resource management to improve the overall wellbeing of the region's communities and natural environment.
