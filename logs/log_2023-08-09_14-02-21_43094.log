> I'm using the siunitx package in LaTeX. How can I say that something is 1.3e-3 km^2?
**assistant**:
> You can use the `\SI` command from the `siunitx` package to present numbers with units. Here is how you can represent 1.3e-3 km^2:
> 
> ```latex
> \SI{1.3e-3}{\kilo\meter\squared}
> ```
> 
> In this code:
> 
> - The `\SI` command is used to format the number and the unit.
> - `1.3e-3` is the number you want to print.
> - `\kilo\meter\squared` is the unit in which the number is expressed, here it's kilometer squared. The `\kilo` is a prefix symbol.
> 
> Please make sure the `siunitx` package is included in your preamble:
> 
> ```latex
> \usepackage{siunitx}
> ```
> 
> Also, always compile the document with LaTeX command to see the changes after modifying the code.
