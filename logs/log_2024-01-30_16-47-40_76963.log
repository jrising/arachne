> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Synthesized Oceanographic Parameters” as a data gap. Here is the discussion in Dewberry Engineers 2018:

> Needed synthesized oceanographic parameters include currents (speed and direction), sea surface height, wave and wind information, attenuation, water levels, tides, sea surface and ocean temperature, pH, salinity, chlorophyll A, zooplankton, and ocean color. The data may be collected via multiple types of sensors including tide gages, buoys that collect information on waves and ocean chemistry, high frequency radar systems, and satellites, among others. The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) regional associations collect and disseminate observational data.

> The available observational data are very challenging to use. The data arrive in pieces, but would be more usable if they were better synthesized. Some of the synthesized data that are available in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic are not available in the South Atlantic. Ultimately, the data need to be more accessible and usable without further processing.
> 					
> Ocean acidification monitoring data are also needed. The Mid-Atlantic Ocean Acidification Network (MACAN) has two reports coming out soon that will highlight gaps in the monitoring data and additional research needs.
> 					
> In the South Atlantic region, water level and wave height data are available, but observations are far apart and value needs to be added to them. More tide gages would be desirable, although it is recognized that it may be cost prohibitive to densify that network.
> 					
> The Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) coordinates two funded portals related to oceanographic data: the Alaska Ocean Acidification Network and the Alaska Harmful Algal Bloom Network. There is a need for forecast data in order to mitigate for ocean acidification. The greatest concerns regarding impacts of acidification on fisheries and other resources are local, yet the nearshore data are the hardest to tease out of the available data.
> 					
> Data on harmful algal blooms may be collected on individual research cruises, but they are not always coordinated and getting agreement from researchers to make their data available to a larger community of users, and synthesizing the data, can be challenging.
> 					
> Great Lakes buoy coverage is inadequate and not year round. Many buoys are pulled in the fall and replaced in the spring, but the timing is often such that there are gaps in data availability during times when shipping is still ongoing. Year-round all-weather buoys would address this concern. Additionally, local data needs are not adequately addressed by the resolution of the available monitoring data.

> ### Synthesized Oceanographic Parameters: Data Gaps Relevant to Delaware's Ocean and Bay Planning
> 
> Synthesized oceanographic parameters represent a significant data gap for optimizing ocean and bay planning efforts, including those in Delaware. These parameters include, but are not limited to, currents (speed and direction), sea surface height, wave and wind information, attenuation, water levels, tides, sea surface and ocean temperature, pH, salinity, chlorophyll A, zooplankton, and ocean color [(Dewberry Engineers, 2018)](https://www.example.com/source1).
> 
> Addressing these data gaps could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of offshore aquaculture siting and impacts, fisheries management, community resilience and climate adaptation, species and habitat management, water quality, offshore renewable energy siting, and sediment management. The data collected could also aid in making decisions on permitting and siting for nearshore and offshore structures, and inform on considerations for Great Lake water levels and subsistence uses [(Dewberry Engineers, 2018)](https://www.example.com/source1).
> 
> However, the current challenge is not only about the lack of data but also about the format in which it is provided. The current state of the data, which arrives in piecemeal instead of a synthesized format, presents difficulty in use [(Dewberry Engineers, 2018)](https://www.example.com/source1). In addition to this, the need for ocean acidification monitoring data has been emphasized, as upcoming reports by the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Acidification Network (MACAN) are expected to outline gaps within this area [(Dewberry Engineers, 2018)](https://www.example.com/source1).
> 
> According to Trice et al. (2021), synthesis of monitoring and observation data collected by various regional entities is required. The authors suggest that derived products from the raw data, such as forecasts and depictions of change over time, are required. They further emphasize the need for densification or winterizing of monitoring devices, which would greatly improve the usability of the collected data. Finally, standardized seasonal, annual, or decadal products are needed on an ocean-basin scale for parameters like temperature, salinity, oxygen, biomass, and productivity [(Trice et al., 2021)](https://www.example.com/source2).
> 
> In terms of relevance to Delaware's ocean and bay planning process, these data gaps in synthesized oceanographic parameters are critical as they may impact multiple aspects of offshore development, environmental management, and climate resilience strategies. By addressing these data gaps, a more sustainable and efficient planning process can be developed in Delaware's marine regions.
