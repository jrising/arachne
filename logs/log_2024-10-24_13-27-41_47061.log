**assistant**:
> No, there is generally no difference between saying something is in "constant" 2022 dollars and "real" 2022 dollars. Both terms refer to values that have been adjusted for inflation to reflect the purchasing power of a dollar in 2022. This adjustment allows for consistent comparisons over time by accounting for changes in the price level. These terms are often used interchangeably in economic discussions.
