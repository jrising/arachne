**assistant**:
> Yes, you can export a design layout from one QGIS project file (QGZ) to another. However, it's important to note that there isn't a direct "export/import" function for this within QGIS. You can accomplish it by following these steps:
> 
> 1. Open the QGIS project that has the layout you want to export.
> 2. Open the 'Print Layout' view.
> 3. Save the layout as a layout template via 'Layout' -> 'Save As Template...'. This will create a "QPT" file.
> 4. Now open your target QGZ project where you want to import the layout.
> 5. Go to the ‘Print Layout’.
> 6. From the 'Layout' menu, select 'Add from Template...' and choose the QPT file you saved earlier.
> 
> Please note an important caveat: the layout references layers by name. So if your second project doesn't have layers with the same names, your layout might not work as expected. In that case, you will have to manually adjust the layer properties in your layout.
