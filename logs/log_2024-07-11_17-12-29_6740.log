> Title: Bridging the Disconnect: A Joint Perspective on Economic and Physical Sciences of Climate Risks
> 
> Abstract: Current understanding of the social and economic risks of climate change remains inadequate to inform the decision-making for governments, communities, and businesses. Achieving the next generation of risk projections requires deeply transdisciplinary efforts. This necessitates a common understanding of the nature and full scale of climate change impacts, building upon the unique insights of multiple fields. A deep disconnect exists between physical scientists and economists around the characterisation of climate risks, undermining communication between fields and to decision-makers, including governments, businesses and the public, and delaying progress. This perspective identifies the factors that create this gap, as well as the insights available from a wider range of disciplines. It then discusses prospects for bridging the gap and a future multidisciplinary research agenda to inform solutions.

> Introduction
> 
> The record-breaking global air and sea temperatures of 2023 are likely an indication of the main driver of the string of climate impacts observed across the globe: catastrophic wildfires, floods, droughts, land and marine heat waves, to name a few. These disasters are expected to reduce social well-being across the globe, undermining agriculture and food security (Jägermeyr et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2017), pushing more families into poverty (Baarsch et al., 2020; Hallegatte et al., 2016), and resulting in higher heat-related mortality (Carleton et al., 2022; Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021). The consequences of some of the impacts in 2023 may last decades (Bastien-Olvera et al., 2022) and accelerate the world towards irreversible climate thresholds (Ditlevsen & Ditlevsen, 2023).
> 
> It is certain that large-scale climate changes will result in pervasive disruption to lives and livelihoods, with potentially catastrophic repercussions, especially for the world’s most vulnerable communities. However, our understanding of the capacity for and consequences of adaptation and resilience is very poor. A full assessment of climate risks depends upon the dynamic vulnerabilities and exposures of communities, their resilience on multiple temporal and spatial scales, and opportunities for changing how we interact with and manage natural systems. Institutions shape how the multiple sources of risk, and concurrent and cascading events, impact humanity. There are relatively low levels of knowledge and understanding about how climate change impacts may contribute to political instability and conflict. Moreover, the environmental basis for the global economy is likely to change dramatically over the century, with climate change as one factor driving those changes. Climate impacts and human and natural system transitions are integrated, coevolving, and subject to deep uncertainties (IPCC, 2022).
> 
> Due to this complexity, existing economic assessments of climate risk are not fit-for-purpose to inform individual, community, or government planning for climate change. Assessments are incomplete: across 11 multi-sector bottom-up studies reviewed by Piontek et al. (2021), the median number of channels of impact included was 7, of which a median 2 captured some adaptation. In contrast, 66 impact channels were identified for the United Kingdom (Watkiss et al., 2021). Interactions between risk channels are almost non-existent, except through Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models which impose strong assumptions about the marginal nature of economic changes.
> 
> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has highlighted clearly the problems with current assessments of the potential economic impacts of climate change. Chapter 16 of the contribution of IPCC Working Group II to the Sixth Assessment Report (O’Neill et al 2022) states:
> 
> “Recent global estimates of the economic cost of climate impacts exhibit significant spread and generally increase with global average temperature, as well as vary by other drivers, such as income, population and composition of the economy (high confidence). The wide variation across disparate methodologies does not allow a robust range of damage estimates to be identified with confidence, though the spread of estimates increases with warming in all methodologies, indicating higher risk (in terms of economic costs) at higher temperatures (high confidence).”
> 
> It also noted: “Comprehensive economic estimates are challenging to produce for many reasons, including complex interactions among physical, natural and social systems; pervasive climate, socioeconomic and system response uncertainties; and the heterogeneous nature of climate impacts that vary across space and time.” The report included a discussion of the many areas which require further study.
> 
> Achieving a better understanding of the economic impacts of climate change requires intensive collaboration between the natural and social sciences. Unfortunately, significant gaps exist between these disciplines, particularly between physical science and economics, with different fundamental assumptions, understandings of the risks, and histories of intellectual development. To effectively propose a combined path forward for natural scientists and social scientists, it is first necessary to understand the differences between these disciplines.
> 
> Many natural scientists believe that there is an imminent risk of pervasive, long-term disruption of environmental systems due to continued GHG emissions. This is motivated by the potential for drastic, systemic, and unforeseen disruptions in natural processes that people depend on beyond 1.5 °C. Many of these changes would be irreversible, and could prove catastrophic locally and globally. Given these high-stakes uncertainties, much of the scientific community endorses a preventative approach of rapid and extensive decarbonization.
> 
> Almost all environmental economists agree that climate change requires substantial policy intervention, and that the long-term benefits of decarbonization outweigh its immediate costs. However, many economists believe that climate action should be weighed against other urgent global priorities such as poverty reduction, which has large, immediate effects including building resilience to climate impacts. They point to an observed capacity of humans to adapt, suggesting that no likely climate impacts will undermine sustained economic growth. If so, any transition to a green economy should similarly avoid large-scale economic disruption.
> 
> The natural science and economic perspectives above should not be understood as two extremes on an alarmism spectrum. Instead, we believe that compelling points in each perspective should be better engaged with and studied. Truly interdisciplinary progress on understanding the economic impacts of climate change will need to successfully integrate insights from both disciplines.
> 
> This article is aimed at bridging the gap between these disciplines, and highlighting urgent multidisciplinary research needs and promising approaches to move forward.
> 
> The scale of the challenge
> 
> The need for multidisciplinary engagement around climate risks emerges from several features particular to the climate challenge.
> 
> Climate change will result in changes in the structure and functioning of both the environment and the economy. Importantly, these changes will be “non-marginal” (as economists say), resulting in a new state (as natural scientists say) for the coupled economic-environmental system. People will respond to these changes as part of a complex dynamic, with decisions occurring at multiple scales. The impacts that are experienced, adaptive responses to them, and mitigation actions will all change the structure of the coupled system. As a result, past experience is a poor proxy for future projections.
> 
> In this context, the assessment of economic risks is an enormous challenge. To be fit-for-purpose, assessments should include (1) a more comprehensive collection of market, non-market, and catastrophic risks; (2) persistence, interactions, and cascading effects; (3) autonomous and policy-driven adaptation and its costs; (4) redistribution of economic activity and economic feedbacks; and (5) multiple forms of uncertainty including deep uncertainty.
> 
> A number of potential crucial, understudied risk channels have been identified. While a range of channels for mortality have been studied, the consequences of climate-related morbidity and psychological health are poorly understood. Another area of concern is the interaction between climate and economic tipping points for the food system, where large food producing regions could fail (e.g., northern Europe under AMOC collapse, India under monsoon weakening), which could cascade into protectionist policies that increase the risk of famine.
> 
> Figure 1 offers a perspective on the current state of knowledge on market and non-market damages. While the direct impacts under several market-based channels have been extensively studied, significant gaps remain for interacting (e.g., concurrent and sequential) impacts and the structural changes associated with impacts, and very few non-market losses are well-understood.

> Figure 1: An assessment of currently available risk information. Inspired by Stern (2007), ch. 6.
> 
> 
> Under this situation, policy-makers and decision-makers are missing key information. They need both financial and non-financial information on risks and adaptation options, along with their associated uncertainties. They need to know which populations and industries bear the brunt of losses and what can be done to redistribute those losses. They need policy scenarios that account for the complex local and global dynamics and structural changes discussed above.
> 
> Developing fit-for-purpose estimates will require engaging with the frontier of understanding in many fields. Within the field of economics, labor, development, behavioral, and industrial economists will need to join environmental economists, and the economic understanding of innovation, gender and race, finance, and urban dynamics will need to be incorporated into results more widely. Across social science in general, the gap between in-lab experiments, real-world interventions, ex-post analysis, and institutional complexities need to be narrowed significantly. Just as biophysical and engineering analyses without the insights of social science will produce vastly different answers (Kotchen et al., 2023), social science that is not deeply informed by concrete physical complexities will be inoperable.

> Despite this need, basic communication remains a challenge between fields. Here, we highlight some of the underlying assumptions that help explain differing perspectives on the climate change problem.

> Corollaries
> 
> A1: The economy is circumscribed by the natural environment, sometimes in ways that are not obvious.
> C1: Disruption of the natural environment represents an existential threat.
> A2: Human and natural systems are not robust to tail events, which are becoming more frequent.
> C2: Even small changes represent significant risks.
> A3: Beyond an unknown threshold, the state of the Earth system will change qualitatively and irreversibly.
> 
> A4: Innovation has driven income growth, and this background trend will be largely unaffected by climate change.

> A6: Vulnerability decreases with income.
> 
> 
> While there have been long-standing debates within economics about the relationship between the human and natural world, under the headings of the embedded economy and strong sustainability, it is much more common within the natural sciences to assume that economic activity is existentially dependent upon the natural world (assumption A1). If economic activity is dependent in this way, it follows that disruption of the climate system presents a dire, and potentially existential, threat to human wellbeing (corollary C1).
> 
> Both economists and natural scientists highlight the importance of uncertainty for climate policy. However, uncertainty can increase the incentives for either proactive action or delays, depending upon how it enters into the decision-making process. In particular, if uncertain, catastrophic outcomes are made more likely by climate change (A2-A3), this demands strong proactive and precautionary climate policy (C2). If, on the other hand, climate risks do not threaten the core of the economic system, as many economists believe (A4, C3), then other priorities may dominate decision-making.
> 
> This kind of trade-off between policy options is a hallmark of the economic contribution to climate policy: since mitigation has both costs and benefits, extreme climate action may have undesirable consequences for society. One key dynamic relates to economic development: as poor countries grow, they benefit both from higher incomes (A5) and from reduced climate vulnerability (A6). As a result, policies that impose costs on poor countries and thereby undermine their growth, are to be avoided (C4).
> 
> Misunderstandings also emerge from the common modeling approaches used by the two fields to better understand the risks of climate change. Natural science and engineering disciplines rely upon process-based, biophysical, and engineering models. While these three terms are often used to designate distinct classes of models, they all have general strengths and weaknesses relative to the statistical, econometric models used by much of the economics discipline.
> 
> Process-based models represent the detailed physics of a system, and explicitly represent specific technologies and the effects of adaptation options. Parameter values for process-based models are often derived from lab experiments or field studies. Human decisions and management practices are considered inputs to these models.
> 
> Econometric approaches use larger datasets, and rely upon either natural experiments (e.g., unexpected weather variation) or randomized treatment-control trials to evaluate the causal component of the effects under real-world conditions. The resulting models are “black-boxes”, but include the result of endogenous human decision-making and adaptation. In contrast, process-based models make the role of technologies and adaptation explicit. Where econometric models reflect the role of technologies and adaptations currently used, process-based models have technology and adaptation choices imposed or identified through optimization.
> 
> Econometric methods are more effective at capturing both within-sample variation and out-of-sample variation under present-day conditions. However, they embed hidden stationarity assumptions, and the physics-based assumptions of process-based models are expected to be more reliable in the further future.
> 
> Importantly, the assumptions and methods of both fields are supported by extensive evidence, academic literature, and long histories of intellectual development. Rather than trying to develop a common cross-disciplinary approach to challenging climate problems, we should seek an understanding that is informed by both disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge.
> 
> Recommendations to bridge the gap
> 
> While the assumptions, modeling approaches, and criteria for academic contributions are different between natural sciences and economics, there are clear pathways for improving collaboration, and through better collaboration to develop an improved understandings of climate risks.
> 
> While econometrics and process-based models are generally considered antagonistic, their differences suggest a method for integrating them to make better projections. Econometric models use historical data to capture the outcomes of complex behaviors in real-world scenarios. Process-based model outputs can be used in place of, or in addition to, historically observed data to improve these models, since these can be easily constructed to be exogenous inputs. This would then allow for more credible future projections, by using process-model outputs in the projection process to capture the nonstationarities embedded within these models.
> 
> At the same time, process-models can be improved with a variety of well-understood human processes. In particular, the role of future learning, of frictions and lock-in, and the drivers behind autonomous adaptation are all crucial for understanding the true scale of future impacts. Economic models allow the decision-making process to be quantified and parameterized. Future process-based model development should build upon this economic research.
> 
> One recommendation specifically for physical scientists is to improve the handling of uncertainty. Economists are often very concerned with uncertainty, because of its wide-ranging implications for behavior and for policy recommendations, and have sophisticated ways of handling it. Many process-based models do not include uncertainty, and where it is included, it is often driven only by climate uncertainty, ignoring parameter, socioeconomic, and valuation uncertainties. As consumers of natural science information, economists rely upon physical scientists to quantify uncertainties across a much larger collection of outputs.
> 
> A recommendation specifically for economists is to incorporate advanced robust decision-making in more work. In the near-term, core differences in assumptions can be treated as a kind of epistemological uncertainty. Approaches in robust decision-making can be used to make appropriate policies in this case, and the inclusion of this kind of uncertainty typically supports a preventative approach (van der Ploeg & Rezai, 2019).
> 
> Finally, interdisciplinary collaboration requires (1) transdisciplinary literacy and (2) frequent open-ended engagement. While more grant projects are requiring PIs of multiple disciplines, the work streams of those grants often remain siloed. To further the goal of interdisciplinary progress, discipline-specific work-streams within interdisciplinary collaborations should include participants across the fields. The box below also provides a glossary of some key concepts, central to the thinking of these different fields. Economists are also directed to Hsiang & Kopp (2018).
> 
> Box: Cross-disciplinary Glossary
> Physical and Biological Science Terms
> Hazard: In the context of the IPCC risk framework, a hazard refers to a potentially damaging physical event or phenomenon, such as heatwaves, floods, storms, or droughts, which can pose risks to human and natural systems.
> Exposure: The nature and degree to which a system, element, or population is exposed to climate hazards. It encompasses the presence of people, ecosystems, or assets in places that could be adversely affected.
> Biophysical/Process-based model: A modeling approach that simulates the physical processes and interactions in the natural world to understand the impacts of climate change.
> Reasons For Concern (RFC): Five risk categories identified by the IPCC with particularly expansive consequences.
> Tipping Elements: Components of the Earth system that could be tipped into qualitatively different states by small external perturbations, which in turn might lead to severe consequences for large proportions of the planetary ecosystem.
> Social Science and Economics Terms
> Economic damages: Refers to the quantifiable economic costs associated with impacts or losses resulting from climate change. It goes beyond financial losses or declines in GDP by considering the broader welfare consequences across populations, including non-market goods like health, ecosystem services, and environmental appreciation.
> Social welfare function: A concept in economics that captures the overall well-being or utility derived from the consumption of goods and services by a society. It provides a framework for evaluating policies and decision-making processes.
> Marginal effect: The local derivative of an outcome or response with respect to a specific variable. Distinct from “marginal”, which refers to a small change.
> Social Cost of Carbon: Estimate of the economic damages that would result from emitting one additional ton of greenhouse gas.
> Non-Marginal Changes: Large-scale changes that significantly shift markets or systems, away from the standard economic assumption of small, gradual, or incremental changes. Large shocks to economic systems, such as those that could occur with extreme climate events, are examples of non-marginal changes.
> Econometric model: A statistical model used in economics that seeks to analyze and quantify the causal relationships between exogenous predictors and endogenous outcomes.
> Path Dependency/Lock-In/Frictions: The tendency of institutions, cultures, technologies, or methodologies to be shaped by their past—relevant in understanding why certain harmful climate behaviors continue despite evidence of their negative impacts.
> 
> 
> Research priorities for interdisciplinary progress
> 
> Below are some crucial research initiatives that interdisciplinary collaboration can focus on in the next decade.
> Prioritize Disaggregated Data and Integration of Local Information: Emphasizing the need for context-specific, localized data in economic assessments ensures accurate representation of regional climate change impacts.
> Integrate Extreme Events and Climate-induced Hazards: Improve economic analysis of climate change by incorporating previously excluded hazard categories such as wildfires and flooding, enhancing damage functions in integrated assessment models, and exploring novel approaches to understand the economic impacts of extreme events and climate-induced hazards.
> Focus on Impacts of Earth System Tipping Points: Conduct research that advances understanding of potential physical impacts of global Earth system tipping points and regional/local tipping points. Examining the links between ecological regime change and tipping points, and integrating these findings into economic assessments through international cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential.
> Account for Adaptation in Assessments: Empirical analysis and model-based research are needed to understand economic implications of existing and future planned adaptation responses to climate change. Incorporating adaptation into economic assessments at various scales and communicating these findings to decision-makers will inform practical adaptation and development efforts.
> Integrate Adaptation and Development: Highlighting the essential role of adaptation in economic analysis and policy-making can help mitigate the risks of climate change and support development goals.
> Integrate Nature, Health, and Social Aspects: Advocate for a multi-faceted approach that includes natural, health, and social aspects of climate change within economic assessments.
> Study Economic Implications of Population Displacement: Investigate how changing climate conditions will influence future population displacement and migration flows. Integrate data on these trends into economic assessments of climate change and develop novel assessment approaches that include population displacement and migration.
> Incorporate Ethics, Inequality, and Justice: Economic analysis should consider ethical dimensions, obligations due to future generations, and issues of global justice.
> Communicate Uncertainty through Storylines: Novel ways to communicate the potential range of climate impacts are needed which can address uncertainty in a manner relevant to policy-making.
> Address Methodological Challenges: Addressing methodological challenges is crucial, especially those associated with analyzing unprecedented events or system instabilities. Consideration should also be given to potential biases towards data-driven analysis, with a need to explore alternative methods for anticipating and analyzing future uncertainties in climate change assessments.

> 
> The disconnect between physical scientists and economists in characterizing climate risks poses a significant barrier to effective policy-making. This paper has highlighted the important contributions of both disciplines and called for a more integrated, transdisciplinary approach to understand and address the economic impacts of climate change. Bridging this gap is essential if we are to develop more comprehensive, fit-for-purpose risk assessments that can inform better decision-making by governments, communities, and businesses.
> 
> Progress in this area mandates greater collaboration and communication between disciplines, the adoption of integrated modeling approaches, and the acknowledgment of deep uncertainties inherent in our projections. A shift in both mindset and methodology is vital: natural scientists must improve the representation of human decision-making and the dynamic, adaptive nature of human systems in their models, while economists need to enhance their treatment of uncertainties and non-marginal changes.
> 
> Transdisciplinary literacy and open-ended engagement are critical for fostering the understanding necessary to tackle the multifaceted challenges of climate change. Developing a common language and set of assumptions will facilitate more productive interactions and elevate the quality of interdisciplinary research. Equally important is the need to simplify and effectively communicate complex scientific findings to policymakers and the public to drive informed and timely action.
> 
> Urgent research priorities identified in this paper include the need for disaggregated data, integration of extreme events and Earth system tipping points into economic models, focused studies on adaptation strategies, and the consideration of ethical, justice, and inequality dimensions. By addressing these gaps and challenges, we can better prepare for and mitigate the pervasive disruptions climate change will bring, safeguarding our environment and economies.
> 
> In conclusion, if we can bridge the disciplinary divide and work collaboratively, we stand a better chance of developing robust, scientifically-grounded strategies to manage and mitigate climate risks. The stakes are high and the need for interdisciplinary research and action is immediate. This joint perspective seeks to chart a path forward, harnessing the strengths of both physical and economic sciences, to build a sustainable, resilient future.
