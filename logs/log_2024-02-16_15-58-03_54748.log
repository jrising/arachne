**user**:
> In IMPLAN's "Region Summary", I do not see what year the data is in. Is it in the year that the data is from or in the current year?
**assistant**:
> The data in IMPLAN's "Region Summary" is typically reported in the year in which the data was collected. However, IMPLAN does perform adjustments to situate the data in a reference year. This procedure is called "data aging" or "temporal interpolation", so the data represents the region's economy during the reference year, which can differ from the collection year.
> 
> Unfortunately, IMPLAN doesn't always make it clear which year is the reference year in every part of their software. This information is usually found in the metadata or the study information related to your specific dataset. Remember also that there can be a lag of a few years between the present year and the latest data available in economic databases due to the time it takes to collect, process, and validate data.
> 
> If you're unsure what year your data is in, I recommend referring back to your data purchase or contacting IMPLAN support for clarification. IMPLAN is typically very responsive and they should be able to clear up any confusion.
