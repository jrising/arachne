> I am planning a family trip to the UK, and we want to take a trip for a few days up to Scotland. My wife and I have been to Edinburgh, so we were thinking of going further north. But we also want to make sure that the activities are fun for our older son, who will have just turned 4. Any suggestions?

> That sounds like an exciting family adventure! Scotland has beautiful destinations that mix natural beauty, culture, and fun activities suitable for your 4-year-old. Here are some suggestions:
> 
> **1. Inverness and Loch Ness**
> Inverness is a city in the Scottish Highlands. It's a beautiful place with plenty of family-friendly attractions. Visit the Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, or take a stroll around the Ness Islands. A highlight would be a trip to see Loch Ness, home of the famous Loch Ness Monster. A cruise on Loch Ness could be both exciting and educational, and it's an activity that many children enjoy. 
> 
> **2. Cairngorms National Park**
> Located in the heart of the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorms National Park offers plenty of activities for families. There are outdoor playgrounds, walking trails suitable for younger kids, and plenty of animals to see. The Highland Wildlife Park, home to polar bears and other unique wildlife, is located here. The Landmark Forest Adventure Park also offers a great day out with play areas, nature trails, and a butterfly house.
> 
> **3. Aviemore**
> This town is located within the Cairngorms National Park and offers several family-friendly attractions. Visit the Strathspey Steam Railway, a heritage railroad that's certain to captivate your son. The Macdonald Aviemore Resort also has a large indoor play area if you need an activity for a rainy day.
> 
> **4. Skye**
> This large island has a lot to offer, with stunning landscapes, castles, and friendly Highland coos (cows). Visit the Fairy Pools, a series of crystal-clear pools on the River Brittle. Note that the path to the pools may be rough in places, so plan accordingly.
> 
> While these are some of the standout attractions, Scotland is filled with beautiful places and activities that families can enjoy. Remember to plan some downtime as well, as young children can get overwhelmed with too much travel. Also, Scotland's weather can change quite rapidly, so make sure to pack layers of clothing that can be added or removed as necessary. Enjoy your trip!
