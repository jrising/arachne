> I am adapting a previous proposal for a 4+1 program joint between the department of economics and the Biden School to a new proposal for a 4+1 program between ecomics and the Masters in Environmental Economics program, within the School of Marine Science and Policy. Here is the original of a "Statement of purpose" section:
> 
> The Joseph R. Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy and Administration (SPPA) proposes a new  accelerated dual-degree program with the Master of Public Policy (MPP) and the existing  Bachelor of Science in Economics (BS-ECON). This new 4+1 program seeks to provide  professional training in policy analysis to students with an academic background in economic  theory and empirical analysis. This accelerated program would parallel the successful 4+1  program of the Master of Public Policy (MPP) with the Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy (BA MPP). With the common orientation towards methodological rigor and analysis, the BABS ECON-MPP would provide Economics majors interested in policy research a 4+1 program since  the Economics M.A. and its associated 4+1 program are no longer offered. 
> 
> And here is another example of a 4+1 program in the marine school:
> 
> The School of Marine Science & Policy offers an interdisciplinary 4+1 MS program with a Concentration in Marine BioSciences. The degree focuses on marine organisms, from cell to whole organism. Core competencies include marine adaptations of organisms, organismal physiology, ecosystem study and understanding of the marine environment. Students can choose additional classes which focus on microorganisms, invertebrates, fish, coral, ecosystem dynamics, and marine pollution. Interdisciplinary study is a focus of the program, with students graduating proficient in both biology and another core discipline of marine policy or chemistry, geology, or physical oceanography.

> Can you write a "Statement of purpose" based on these for the new 4+1 EE program?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a draft "Statement of purpose" for the new 4+1 program between the Economics Department and the Masters in Environmental Economics program within the School of Marine Science and Policy:

> ---
> 
> The School of Marine Science and Policy, in collaboration with the Department of Economics, proposes a new accelerated dual-degree program that integrates the Bachelor of Science in Economics (BS-ECON) with the Master’s in Environmental Economics (MEECON). This innovative 4+1 program aims to equip students with a profound understanding of economic theory and empirical skills applied to environmental challenges. Through this program, students will develop expertise in environmental economics, policy analysis, and sustainable resource management.
> 
> Building on the successful interdisciplinary approach of the School's existing programs, this 4+1 initiative provides economics majors a unique opportunity to delve into the environmental aspects of economics, complementing their academic rigor with practical methodologies focused on sustainability. Core competencies will include environmental policy evaluation, resource economics, and ecological economic systems.
> 
> Students will engage in a curriculum that fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing them to explore complementary subjects such as marine policy, ecological modeling, and environmental chemistry. This cross-disciplinary emphasis prepares graduates to tackle complex environmental issues, providing them with a robust foundation for careers in policy, academia, and industry.
> 
> Overall, the program is designed to nurture the next generation of economists with the knowledge and skills to contribute effectively to the field of environmental sustainability.
**user**:
> This is almost twice as long as the original examples. Can you shorten it?
**assistant**:
> Of course! Here’s a more concise version of the "Statement of Purpose" for the new 4+1 program:
