**assistant**:
> It looks like the `rabbitmq-server` is failing to start, and thus preventing your R upgrade. Before debugging this issue further, let's first ascertain if `rabbitmq-server` is a necessary component for your R upgrade or your work environment.
> 
> If `rabbitmq-server` is not necessary, you could simply remove it or not including it in your upgrade process. 
> 
> Here is how you can remove the `rabbitmq-server`:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get remove rabbitmq-server
> ```
> 
> However, if `rabbitmq-server` is necessary, you will need to troubleshoot its installation problem. It could be caused by various issues such as lack of memory, wrong Erlang version, or already opened ports by other applications.
> 
> To get more insights on the error:
> 
> 1. Reattempt to start the `rabbitmq-server` service and watch the logs:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
> journalctl -u rabbitmq-server
> ```
> 
> 2. Also, check the RabbitMQ log which defaults to `/var/log/rabbitmq/` or it can be found by running `sudo rabbitmqctl report`.
> 
> Once you have specific logs, you can further diagnose the problem. If it relates to R upgrades, I can help you better if you could provide me some details on the R version you're trying to upgrade and how you're performing the upgrade.
