> What is "Global Sensitivity Analysis" and how does it compare to ANOVA?
**assistant**:
> "Global Sensitivity Analysis" is a statistical method used in the context of mathematical modeling to identify key inputs affecting the output of a computational model. It assesses the sensitivity of the results to changes in all input factors across the entire parameter space, hence the term "global.” The most traditional approaches are known as "variance-based methods" or Sobol indices, which measures the proportional contribution of each input to the output variance, accounting for interactions with other inputs.
> 
> Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique that is used to assess the factors that affect a dependent variable in an experiment. It works by decomposing the variability observed in the output and attributing it to the different input factors and their interactions.
> 
> Global Sensitivity Analysis and ANOVA share similar objectives because both are used to understand the effect of input factors on an output variable. Yet, there are also crucial differences:
> 
> 1. **Scope**: While ANOVA is mostly used in controlled experiments, Global Sensitivity Analysis is used in mathematical and simulation modeling, where experiments might not be feasible or ethical, and there are potentially many uncontrollable factors.
> 
> 2. **Interactions & Nonlinearity**: GSA assumes the outputs to be a function of the inputs in potential very complex and nonlinear ways, and deeply accounts for interactions between inputs. ANOVA on the other hand typically assumes a linear relationship (or simple non-linear ones, such as polynomial terms, in expanded models) between inputs and output, and interactions often must be explicitly specified.
> 
> 3. **Parameter Space**: GSA considers change across the entire parameter space of each input factor, while ANOVA generally considers categorical group differences (though extensions of the model can consider continuous input variation).
> 
> Given the above, when your task involves examining complex, potentially nonlinear models and multiple uncertain parameters that span an entire parameter space, Global Sensitivity Analysis can be a more appropriate choice. For controlled experiments with categorical group differences, ANOVA is a traditional and effective method.

> How do I do GSA in R?
**assistant**:
> To perform Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) in R, you can use various packages that provide functions to compute sensitivity indices. One popular package for GSA in R is the "sensitivity" package. Here's a general overview of how you can conduct GSA using the "sensitivity" package:
> 
> 1. **Install and Load the Package**:
>    If you haven't already installed the "sensitivity" package, you can do so by running:
>    ```R
>    install.packages("sensitivity")
>    ```
>    Then load the package into your R session:
>    ```R
>    library(sensitivity)
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Define your Model**:
>    You need to have a function that represents your model. This function takes input parameters and returns the output of the model.
> 
> 3. **Create the Input Space**:
>    Define the input parameters and their ranges using the `sobol` function from the "sensitivity" package. For example:
>    ```R
>    parameters <- list(M = c(1, 10), beta = c(0.5, 2))
>    input <- parameterSet(parameters)
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Run the Sensitivity Analysis**:
>    Use the `soboljansen` function to perform the sensitivity analysis. This function estimates the Sobol' indices using the Jansen approach.
>    ```R
>    results <- soboljansen(model = your_model_function, X = input, nboot = 100)
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Interpret the Results**:
>    The `results` object will contain the estimated first-order, total-order, and second-order Sobol' indices, as well as the estimates of their variances. You can use these sensitivity indices to understand the impact of input parameters on the model output.
> 
> 6. **Visualize the Results**:
>    You can visualize the sensitivity indices using plots to gain a better understanding of the relationships between input parameters and model output.
> 
> Remember, this is just a basic outline of how to perform GSA using the "sensitivity" package in R. Depending on your specific model and analysis requirements, you may need to customize the approach. Additionally, there are other packages in R, such as "SensitivityCaseControl," that provide different methods for conducting sensitivity analysis.
