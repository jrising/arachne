> The statement refers to two different methodologies for calculating real GDP, each utilizing different kinds of Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs).

> 1. **Output-side Real GDP at Chained PPPs:**
>     - **Chained PPPs:** This approach uses a chain-weighted methodology where the PPPs are updated frequently to reflect current economic conditions and price levels. This means that the base year changes annually, and the relative prices of goods and services are continually updated. The "output-side" component suggests that this measure focuses on the production side of the economy, evaluating the total output.

> 2. **Real GDP at Laspeyres PPPs:**
>     - **Laspeyres PPPs:** This approach uses a fixed base year, maintaining consistent relative prices based on the prices of a specific base year. It tends to undervalue the contribution of new goods and services as it does not update the relative prices regularly. The Laspeyres index is a classic fixed-weight price index that may not reflect changes in consumption patterns and relative prices over time as accurately as chained indices.

> In essence, the difference between these definitions of GDP lies in the way they adjust for price changes and economic conditions over time. Chained PPPs provide a more current and dynamic measure by frequently updating the base year, while Laspeyres PPPs use a fixed base year, providing a constant and historical perspective. This can lead to different growth rates and economic interpretations.
