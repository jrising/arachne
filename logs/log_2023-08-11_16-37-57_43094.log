> Can you write a strong response to the following prompt:
> How have you demonstrated an ability to build systems and implement structure within the grantmaking function in your previous roles? Please describe how your views on solidarity philanthropy (or trust-based philanthropy) are incorporated into your systems-building practices and the impact these systems have had on the grantmaking function. (please keep your response to 250 words or less)*
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, here's a concise and detailed response for Johanna:
> 
> Throughout my career, I've actively implemented systems and structure within various grantmaking functions. During my tenure at The Climate Group, I individually raised $500,000, bringing in new clients, board members, and supporters. This was achieved by refining member engagement methodologies, building KPI measurement systems, and creating streamlined communication and evaluation protocols. 
> 
> In addition to this, I managed diverse teams on ambitious projects at Carbon Credentials and led client workshops, facts that demonstrate my capability to implement structure in a non-profit context. Regularly developing funding proposals further honed my understanding of the grantmaking ecosystem and its intricacies. 
> 
> My belief in solidarity philanthropy is enacted through fostering strong relationships and creating equitable opportunities. An example is the establishment of the first diversity, equity, and inclusion program at the Clean Energy Buyers Association, which offered a discounted rate to assist companies led by women and people of color, thereby leveling the field in the clean energy sector.
> 
> These systems improved both internal coordination and external partnerships, enhancing the efficiency, inclusivity, and impact of our grantmaking functions. These practices accelerated progress towards our sustainability goals–proving essential in mobilizing resources towards climate change mitigation and forging a path for a more equitable distribution of opportunities within the clean energy sector.
