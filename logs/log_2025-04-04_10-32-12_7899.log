> Dear Alison,
> 
> I am a researcher at the University of Delaware, working with the London School of Economics, and I have recently started some funded work with HMT on the risks of climate change and potential for adaptation. Our goal is to capture evidence on UK risks and adaptation into a tool that HMT and others can use to explore different adaptation plans.
> 
> I would like to invite you to be our representative from OBR on an advisory panel for the project. Danielle Monnier at HMT suggested I reach out to you.
> 
> As an example of this group's role, one of the first meetings of the panel would be to provide input on the structure of the projection scenarios. We want to make sure that our scenarios can support work being done by other groups, including OBR, Defra, and the CCC.
> 
> The current project is just for 12 months, and the advisory group would probably meet four times over that period.
> 
> Let me know if you would be available to participate in this group, or if you would like more information.

> Best,

> Climate risks and how adaptation may mitigate these costs is something we are keen to assess/understand and have a lot of interest in from a fiscal risks perspective.
> 
> Would be great to get some more information on the project, but please count me in!
