With a Poisson distribution, we're modelling counts, and so an increase of one unit in a predictor variable can be interpreted as multiplying the response variable by some factor. For this reason, a one-unit change in the predictor is associated with a *proportional* change in the count, not an *absolute* change as in linear regression.

> Consider this simple example: If we have a coefficient of -0.5 for variable X in a Poisson-distributed dependent variable Y, an increase of 1 in X multiplies Y by e^-0.5, which is about 0.61. This means the count of Y roughly decreases by 39% for each increase of 1 in X.
