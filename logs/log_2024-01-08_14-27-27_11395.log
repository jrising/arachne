**user**:
> In R, I have a dataframe with a row for each year, but I only have non-NA values every 5 years. How can I fill in the NAs?
**assistant**:
> You can use a combination of the `tidyverse` package's `fill()` function and interpolation to fill in the NA values in your DataFrame in R.
> 
> Assuming your DataFrame is called `df`, and the column with the NA values is called `value`, you could utilize the `approx()` function for linear interpolation. Here's how it works:
> 
> ```R
> library(tidyverse)
> 
> # Assume 'year' and 'value' are the column names in your dataframe
> df_filled <- df %>% 
>   group_by(year) %>% 
>   mutate(value = ifelse(is.na(value), 
>                         approx(year, value, xout=year)$y, 
>                         value))
> 
> # Check your new dataframe
> print(df_filled)
> ```
> This code first groups the DataFrame by the 'year' column (if there are other grouping variables, add them inside the `group_by()` function), then it uses `mutate()` to create a new 'value' column. Inside `mutate()`, it uses an ifelse statement to replace NA values with interpolated values (`approx(year, value, xout=year)$y`), and leaves the non-NA values as they are.
> 
> Remember to adjust the column names to match your actual DataFrame. Also, keep in mind that this code performs linear interpolation. Choosing the right interpolation method depends on your specific use case. This simple linear interpolation might not be suitable for all datasets or all situations.
