**user**:
> About how many classes would a teaching professor teach over the course of their career?
**assistant**:
> The number of classes a teaching professor might teach over the course of their career largely depends on their specific teaching load, often determined by their institution, and the length of their career.
> 
> Let's consider a typical scenario as an example:
> 
> 1. Universities: On average, a professor at a typical university could teach between 2 to 4 courses per semester. Let's average that to 3 courses per semester.
> 
> 2. Semesters: Most universities have 2 main semesters per year (fall and spring), but some professors might also teach during the summer semester. To simplify, let's consider the professor teaches for both main semesters.
> 
> 3. Career length: Let's say a professor begins their career around the age of 30 and retires around the age of 65. That's a total of 35 years.
> 
> So:
> 
> 1. Number of courses per year = 3 courses/semester * 2 semesters = 6 courses/year.
> 2. Number of courses per career = 6 courses/year * 35 years = 210 courses in a career.
> 
> Please note this is a generalized calculation. The actual number could be fewer or greater depending on factors such as research expectations and responsibilities, service to the community, sabbaticals, leave periods, administrative duties, course size, and more. It's also possible for a professor to teach the same class multiple times, which wouldn't count as different or unique classes in our calculation.
