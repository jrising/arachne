> The "Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors" from the EPA has columns for "Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins" and "Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors". What are these?
**assistant**:
> The "Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins" provided by the EPA essentially represent the carbon footprint or the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with each stage of the life cycle of a product or service, without considering the uncertainties or variations. In other words, these values are the average or expected emission factors.
> 
> On the other hand, the "Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors" measure the uncertainties or variations associated with the estimated emission factors. These can be due to several factors such as variations in the production process, differences in regional practices, changes over time, or limitations in data or modeling. This gives a range of emission factors taking into consideration the possible deviations from the average value.
> 
> Think of it like this: if the emission factor is a target, the "Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins" is the bullseye—the expectation or average—and the "Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors" are the outer circles—the range of potential outcomes around that average. The larger the margin, the greater the uncertainty in the emission factor.
