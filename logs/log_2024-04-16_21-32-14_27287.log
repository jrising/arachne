> Is there an approximation for log(1 - x) for small values of x?
**assistant**:
> Yes, for small values of x, there's a widely used approximation for `log(1 - x)`. Taking a Taylor expansion around `x=0` gives us:

> The approximation is valid for |x| < 1. The first term of the series `-x` is usually enough for very small x. The more terms you include, the closer the approximation will be, but it will also be more computationally intensive. The series above assumes that log is the natural logarithm. Please keep respective error margins in mind while using this approximation.
