**assistant**:
> Certainly! In R, you can use regular expressions to match patterns in strings. For the cases you've mentioned, you can use the following regular expression:
> 
> ```r
> pattern <- "^FUND(\\s?[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)*|\\-IAWG)?$"
> ```
> 
> Here's a breakdown of the pattern:
> 
> - `^FUND`: Matches strings that start with "FUND".
> - `(\\s?[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)*)`: Matches optional whitespace followed by digits possibly separated by periods (e.g., "3.2", "3.10", "3.8.1").
>   - `\\s?`: Optional whitespace.
>   - `[0-9]+`: One or more digits.
>   - `(\\.[0-9]+)*`: Zero or more occurrences of a period followed by digits.
> - `|\\-IAWG`: Matches "-IAWG".
> - `?`: The entire group is optional (zero or one occurrence).
> - `$`: Asserts position at the end of the string.
> 
> You can test this pattern using `grepl` for matching strings in R:
> 
> ```r
> strings <- c("FUND 3.2", "FUND 3.10", "FUND 3.8.1", "FUND-IAWG", "FUND3.7", "OTHER STRING")
> matches <- grepl(pattern, strings)
> print(strings[matches])
> ```
> 
> This code will print out only the strings that match the specified pattern.

> And now one that matches "DICE-2010", "DICE 2013R", "DICE-2007", "DICE-2013-IAWG", "DICE-94"?
**assistant**:
> You can use the following regular expression in R to match any of the specified formats like "DICE-2010", "DICE 2013R", "DICE-2007", "DICE-2013-IAWG", and "DICE-94":
> 
> ```r
> pattern <- "^DICE(\\s?[0-9]+[A-Z]?|\\-[0-9]+(-IAWG)?)$"
> ```
> 
> ### Breakdown of the Pattern:
> 
> - `^DICE`: The string must start with "DICE".
> - `(\\s?[0-9]+[A-Z]?|\\-[0-9]+(-IAWG)?)`: This part matches two possible formats:
>   - `\\s?[0-9]+[A-Z]?`: Matches an optional space followed by one or more digits, possibly followed by a single uppercase letter (e.g., "2013R").
>   - `\\-[0-9]+(-IAWG)?`: Matches a hyphen followed by one or more digits, optionally ending with "-IAWG".
> - `$`: Asserts the position at the end of the string.
> 
> ### Example Usage in R:
> 
> You can test this pattern with the following R code:
> 
> ```r
> strings <- c("DICE-2010", "DICE 2013R", "DICE-2007", "DICE-2013-IAWG", "DICE-94", "OTHER STRING")
> matches <- grepl(pattern, strings)
> print(strings[matches])
> ```
> 
> This code will output only the strings that match your specified pattern.
