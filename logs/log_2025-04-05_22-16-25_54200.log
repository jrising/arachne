> The first page of the document titled "Climate Change, Ecosystem Impacts, and Systemic Risks" by Nigel Arnell, Galina Jönsson, Tom Oliver, Deepa Senapathi, and Ajay Gambhir, dated December 2022, features a vivid satellite image of a river delta. The image, likely captured by Landsat, highlights the intricate branching patterns of the river in greens and blues. Surrounding land areas appear in various shades, suggesting diverse vegetation or land use. Water bodies are depicted in deep blues and purples, contrasting with the land and suggesting water currents and different depths. The striking colors accentuate the river delta's natural beauty and complexity.

> The summary addresses growing concerns among politicians, strategists, and environmental campaigners about climate change leading to systemic risks with potentially extreme consequences. These risks could stem not only from direct climate impacts like heatwaves, floods, fires, and droughts but also from ecosystem changes caused by climate change. There is a lack of robust analyses on systemic risks across different emissions pathways and few studies focusing on ecosystem changes relevant to human systems. This report reviews evidence for assessing how ecosystem changes may trigger global systemic risks, proposing a framework that blends quantitative indicators with expert judgment. It emphasizes incorporating ecosystem changes in systemic risk assessments through global indicators and local insights.

> The introduction discusses the significant impact of climate change on the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires, and storms, and its substantial alteration of climate resources for agriculture and ecosystems. It highlights growing public and policymaker concerns about the large-scale existential threats that climate change and major ecosystem changes pose to society and economies. Despite these concerns, few robust assessments of systemic risks — which affect entire systems — exist, particularly those estimating how these risks might vary with different emissions pathways. The recent IPCC report touches on complex risks but does not specifically examine systemic risks. This report aims to address this gap by developing a methodology to assess systemic risks, focusing on how ecosystem changes driven by climate change might combine with direct climate effects to threaten human systems. It reviews existing literature and recent assessments to inform this approach.

> The section discusses systemic risks in the context of climate change, highlighting the importance of scale. Three aspects of scale are emphasized: geographic reach, interconnected linkages, and global systems. Systemic risks differ from direct risks, as they affect entire systems and have broader consequences. The text contrasts systemic risks with direct risks — specific impacts directly linked to climate events, like droughts impacting crop production. Systemic risks are characterized by cascading effects and interconnected vulnerabilities, potentially causing wide-ranging disruptions, such as global food market impacts due to localized crop failures. Climate change compounds these risks by introducing acute shocks and chronic changes, adding complexity to defining and managing systemic risks.

> The page discusses systemic risks related to climate change, emphasizing that these risks are influenced more by system characteristics than by external shocks. Systemic risks are described as endogenous, meaning they originate within the system. Factors such as land use change and geopolitical instability act as threat multipliers, exacerbating these risks. The text refers to the concept of 'nexus risk,' which occurs when multiple risks interact. The page outlines domains of systemic risk, including food insecurity, human health impacts, economic and financial disruption, displacement, and conflict. These risks are interconnected, and small shocks can lead to large systemic consequences based on the system’s resistance and resilience. An example diagram illustrates how direct climate impacts connect to systemic risks, highlighting exposure and vulnerability's role in risk generation.

> This page outlines the challenges and methodologies in assessing systemic risks associated with climate change. While direct climate risks can be quantitatively estimated under certain assumptions, capturing systemic risks requires a more complex approach. These risks are dependent on the dynamics of entire systems and the interplay of decisions by key actors. Traditional data analytics fall short in predicting future systemic risks due to their non-linear nature. To address this, a combination of expert judgment, historical analysis, and qualitative scenario analysis is recommended. A robust assessment necessitates developing narratives and models to assess relationships between variables, exemplified by the use of Causal Loop Diagrams in previous studies. Additionally, potential systemic impacts, such as changes in key species affecting entire ecosystems, must be considered when evaluating these risks.

> The previous page elaborates on systemic risks in relation to ecosystem changes caused by climate change. It highlights the importance of ecosystems, which offer critical services affecting billions of people worldwide. Changes in ecosystems, especially in key species, can have significant ripple effects due to interconnected ecological networks. The text mentions challenges in assessment, driven by factors like emissions scenarios and climate projections, which complicate the characterization of direct and systemic risks. The importance of understanding these changes and their broader impacts is emphasized, setting the stage for discussions on potential indicators to assess such risks.

> The page discusses the role of ecosystems in addressing climate change-related risks. It highlights how ecosystems provide crucial services that, if disrupted by climate change, can contribute to both direct and systemic risks. The text focuses on ten adverse consequences of ecosystem changes that could translate into significant risks. It notes that climate change impacts like resource depletion, loss of genetic resources, pollinator decline, disease emergence, and alterations in water regimes are compounded by additional human pressures such as land use changes. The document emphasizes taking an anthropocentric view of ecosystem impacts, considering their effects on human systems, while also acknowledging the intrinsic value of ecosystems.

> The previous page discusses the significance of ecosystem services in the context of climate change and the adverse consequences of ecosystem changes. It identifies key adverse effects, such as resource depletion, loss of genetic resources, decline in soil quality, and the emergence of diseases, each impacting different ecosystem services like provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural services. The text emphasizes how changes in ecosystems can translate to direct and systemic impacts on human systems, highlighting the interconnectedness of ecological networks. The document further underscores that ecosystem changes will be influenced by factors like land use change, calling attention to the complex interaction between ecosystem changes and human vulnerabilities.

> The direct effects of changes in weather and climate are well-understood, although they are often quantified with considerable uncertainty. Crop production, for instance, will be directly affected by changes in agro-climatic suitability for crops and pests, reductions in time to maturity, the occurrence of heat extremes, and changes in water availability. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere can potentially increase the growth of some plants, while higher temperatures may also affect the ability of farmworkers. 
> 
> Indirectly, climate change may influence the numbers of pollinators and natural predators (Settele et al. 2016), as well as pests and diseases through changes in phenology and timing, and it can affect soil quality and health by altering organic matter content, soil structure, and biome, while stimulating erosion.

> Livestock production will be directly impacted by changes in water availability and heat stress, and it will be indirectly affected through changes to the availability of food and fodder due to ecosystem productivity, as well as the increased occurrence of pests and diseases. 
> 
> Marine production, such as fish and shellfish, will be directly affected by marine heatwaves and ocean acidification, while indirectly affected through changes to ecosystems that support fisheries, caused by factors such as eutrophication and coral bleaching.
> 
> From a human health perspective, climate change has the potential to generate systemic public health and economic disruption risks through increasing heat-related morbidity, trauma, and economic disruption. 
> 
> In summary, physical drivers—such as temperature and rain—along with ecosystem drivers like resource depletion and the expansion and emergence of diseases, lead to various direct and systemic risks, including economic disruption, livelihoods, and food security.
