**assistant**:
> It looks like there might be an issue with how you're determining the `data-upvoted` state of the element. Specifically, it seems that even when you're trying to add an upvote, the `data-upvoted` attribute may not be correctly set to `'0'`, or the check might be failing for some reason.
> 
> Here are a few things to check and possibly correct:
> 
> 1. **Ensure `data-upvoted` is a string**: jQuery's `.data()` method may cache data differently from what you'd expect if you're setting it via markup. Make sure the `data-upvoted` state is initially set properly in your HTML, and check its type when retrieved. For example, if it's numeric or boolean, your strict equality check might fail.
> 
> 2. **Initialization of `data-upvoted`**: When the document is ready or elements are dynamically created, ensure that elements have their `data-upvoted` attribute explicitly set to `'0'` initially if they haven’t been upvoted yet. For example: `<div class="upvote" data-id="1" data-upvoted="0"></div>`.
> 
> 3. **Debugging the click handler**: Add some console logs to trace through the logic:
> 
>    ```javascript
>    $(document).on('click', '.upvote', function() {
>        const id = $(this).data('id');
>        let votedStatements = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('votedStatements') || '[]');
>        const upvotedState = $(this).data('upvoted');
>        console.log(`Voted State of ID ${id}: ${upvotedState}`); // Debugging line
> 
>        if (upvotedState === '0') { // Not upvoted
>            console.log('Not upvoted, incrementing'); // Debugging line
>            $(this).addClass('upvoted').data('upvoted', '1');
>            votedStatements.push(id);
>            $.post('upvote.php', { id: id, increment: true }, function() {
>                loadStatements($('#page').val());
>            });
>        } else { // Already upvoted
>            console.log('Already upvoted, decrementing'); // Debugging line
>            $(this).removeClass('upvoted').data('upvoted', '0');
>            votedStatements = votedStatements.filter(votedId => votedId !== id);
>            $.post('upvote.php', { id: id, increment: false }, function() {
>                loadStatements($('#page').val());
>            });
>        }
> 
>        localStorage.setItem('votedStatements', JSON.stringify(votedStatements));
>    });
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Inspect the initial state of elements**: Make sure all relevant elements have proper initial `data-*` attributes, especially if the list of items is dynamically generated or refreshed.
> 
> By ensuring that the initial state of your elements is set correctly and debugging the output, you should be able to identify the point at which the logic fails and correct it. Let me know if you find any inconsistencies!

**assistant**:
> Based on the logs you shared, it looks like the `data-upvoted` state is not being set correctly or is not being updated as expected. Here are a few things to troubleshoot and potential solutions:
> 
> ### Issues to Investigate
> 
> 1. **Data Type Consistency**: Ensure you are consistently using strings for the `data-upvoted` attribute. If the attribute is stored as a string in HTML, it should always be compared as a string in JavaScript. Check what happens if you treat it as an integer:
> 
>    ```javascript
>    const upvotedState = $(this).data('upvoted');
>    if (upvotedState === '0') { // Check for string '0'
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Proper Setting of `data-upvoted`**: After you change the state with `.addClass()` and `.removeClass()`, make sure you're setting `data-upvoted` correctly and that it doesn't reset unexpectedly:
> 
>    ```javascript
>    $(this).addClass('upvoted').data('upvoted', '1'); // Set to string '1'
>    // Later...
>    $(this).removeClass('upvoted').data('upvoted', '0'); // Set to string '0'
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Check for Race Conditions**: Ensure that there’s no asynchronous behavior that might be causing `data-upvoted` to reset unexpectedly. For instance, when the statements refresh, if the new DOM elements are re-purposed, they might not carry over the expected `data-upvoted`.
> 
> ### Suggestions for Improvement
> 
> 1. **Use the `attr()` method**: Instead of `data()`, consider using `.attr()` to access `data-upvoted` if you're concerned about the caching issue. This might help clarify what value is stored:
> 
>    ```javascript
>    const upvotedState = $(this).attr('data-upvoted');
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Update `data-upvoted` after successful server communication**: It’s generally a good practice to only update your state after you've confirmed that the server action (increment/decrement) has been successful:
> 
>    ```javascript
>    $.post('upvote.php', { id: id, increment: true }, function() {
>        $(this).data('upvoted', '1'); // Only set this if the post was successful
>        loadStatements($('#page').val());
>    }.bind(this)); // Use .bind(this) to refer to the clicked element
>    ```
> 
> ### Example of the Revised Click Handler
> 
> Here’s a revised version of your click handler for better clarity:
> 
> ```javascript
> $(document).on('click', '.upvote', function() {
>     const id = $(this).data('id');
>     let votedStatements = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('votedStatements') || '[]');
>     const upvotedState = $(this).data('upvoted');
> 
>     console.log(`Voted State of ID ${id}: ${upvotedState}`);
> 
>     if (upvotedState === '0') { // Not upvoted
>         console.log('Not upvoted, incrementing');
>         $.post('upvote.php', { id: id, increment: true }, function() {
>             $(this).data('upvoted', '1').addClass('upvoted');
>             votedStatements.push(id);
>             loadStatements($('#page').val());
>         }.bind(this)); // Binding 'this' context
>     } else { // Already upvoted
>         console.log('Already upvoted, decrementing');
>         $.post('upvote.php', { id: id, increment: false }, function() {
>             $(this).data('upvoted', '0').removeClass('upvoted');
>             votedStatements = votedStatements.filter(votedId => votedId !== id);
>             loadStatements($('#page').val());
>         }.bind(this)); // Binding 'this' context
>     }
> 
>     localStorage.setItem('votedStatements', JSON.stringify(votedStatements));
> });
> ```
> 
> This should help ensure that the state is accurately reflected based on the success of your server interactions. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!
