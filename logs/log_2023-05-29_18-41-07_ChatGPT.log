> Suppose that I have multiple models, each of which gives a discrete probability distribution over states of the world s. How can I make the best decision about an action whose utility depends on s, if I don't know which model is correct?

> There are several ways to approach this problem, and the best method may depend on the specifics of your situation, including how much you trust each model, how the models disagree, and how much uncertainty or risk you can tolerate. Here are several common approaches:
> 
> 1. **Model Averaging:** If you can assign probabilities to each model being correct, you can average the distributions given by each model, weighted by the probabilities you assign to each model. This results in a new distribution over states of the world. This is also referred to as Bayesian model averaging.
> 
> 2. **Maximin Decision Rule:** This is a conservative approach which assumes that the worst possible state of the world will occur under each model, and chooses the action which maximizes utility in the worst-case scenario. This is also known as the principle of insufficient reason.
> 
> 3. **Minimax Regret:** This is a modification of the maximin rule that instead of looking at worst-case scenarios, it looks at worst-case regrets. Regret is defined as the difference between the utility that could have been achieved with the best action and the utility actually achieved with the action taken. This approach chooses the action that minimizes the maximum regret.
> 
> 4. **Bayesian Decision Theory:** If you can assign prior probabilities to each model, then you can use Bayes' rule to update these probabilities based on evidence, resulting in posterior probabilities for each model. You would then choose the action that maximizes expected utility, where the expectation is taken with respect to the posterior probabilities of the models. This is a fully Bayesian approach and can be computationally expensive, but it takes into account both your initial beliefs about the models and how these beliefs should be updated in light of evidence.

> 5. **Ensemble Methods:** In machine learning, ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to make a final prediction. This can often result in better performance than any single model. Methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking.
> 
> 6. **Robust Decision Making (RDM):** RDM is a set of methods to support decision making under deep uncertainty. Instead of relying on a single "best estimate" forecast, RDM runs large numbers of simulations to identify a range of plausible future conditions. 
> 
> Remember that these methods have different assumptions and trade-offs. For instance, model averaging assumes that you know the probabilities of each model being correct, which might not be true. The maximin decision rule is very risk-averse and might lead to overly cautious decisions. Bayesians methods can be very computationally intensive and might require information that you don't have. Ensemble methods assume that combining models will lead to better performance, which is not always the case. Finally, Robust Decision Making can be computationally expensive as it involves running a large number of simulations.
