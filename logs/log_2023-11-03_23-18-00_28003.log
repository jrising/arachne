**user**:
> How can I export a table from R to Word?
**assistant**:
> There are several ways to export a table from R to Microsoft Word. Two popular ones include using the `rmarkdown` or `flextable` packages.
> 
> ## Method 1: Using RMarkdown
> 
> 1. Create a new RMarkdown file in RStudio.
> 2. Input your R code into RMarkdown document.
>     Here is an example with a dataframe:
> 
>     ```
>     ```{r}
>     data(mtcars)
>     mtcars
>     ```
>     ```
> 
> 3. Knit your document to Word by pressing the "Knit" button in RStudio and select "Knit to Word".
> 
> This will create a Word document with all your R outputs, including the table.
> 
> ## Method 2: Using Flextable
> 
> 1. First, you need to install and load the package.
>     ```
>     install.packages("flextable")
>     library(flextable)
>     ```
> 
> 2. Create your dataframe in R and assign it to an object.
>     For example, we will use the mtcars data set:
> 
>     ```
>     data(mtcars)
>     ```
> 
> 3. Apply the `flextable()` function to your dataframe and assign it to a new object.
>     ```
>     my_table <- flextable(mtcars)
>     ```
> 
> 4. Write your table to a Word document using the `print()` function.
>     ```
>     print(my_table, 
>           target = "my_table.docx", 
>           docx.styles = "table_template.docx")
>     ```
> 
> This will create a Word document called "my_table.docx" in your current working directory. 
> 
> The `docx.styles = "table_template.docx"` argument is optional and applies a pre-styled table from another Word document to your table. If you want to apply this option, replace "table_template.docx" with the name of your styled Word document.
**user**:
> When I try to install flextable, I get the error:
> Package cairo was not found in the pkg-config search path.
> This is on a mac.
**assistant**:
> The error message you encountered indicates that the "cairo" library, which is a dependency of the "flextable" package, is missing on your Mac. To resolve this issue and successfully install and use the "flextable" package, you'll need to install the "Cairo" library on your system.
> 
> You can install Cairo on macOS using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Here are the steps to install Cairo and resolve the error:
> 
> 1. Open the Terminal application on your Mac. You can find it in the "Utilities" folder within the "Applications" folder.
> 
> 2. Install Homebrew by running the following command in the Terminal:
>    ```shell
>    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
>    ```
> 
> 3. Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install Cairo by running the command:
>    ```shell
>    brew install cairo
>    ```
> 
> 4. After the installation is complete, you can now try to install the "flextable" package again in R:
>    ```R
>    install.packages("flextable")
>    ```
> 
> This time, the installation should proceed without the previous error since the Cairo library is now available on your system.
> 
> Please note that the installation might require administrative privileges, so you may be prompted to enter your password during the Homebrew installation process.
> 
> Once the "flextable" package is successfully installed, you should be able to use it to export tables to Word without encountering the Cairo-related error.
