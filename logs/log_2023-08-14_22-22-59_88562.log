> 1986) can be adapted to understand various house-

> conservation, and off-farm employment) and their
> responses to feedbacks between human and natural
> systems, as households are the basic units of pro-

> their relationships conceptually, as exemplified in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. Another step is to define re- search goals, objectives, questions, and hypotheses. The approach to these tasks is similar to thosl:!in disciplinary research although the focus often re- lates to both subsystems and their interactions. The third step is to quantify the components and their relationships. This step includes several proced- ures: data collection, data cleaning, management, analysis, integration, and visualization. Weprovide more details on these procedures in the remainder of this section below.
> There are many methods for data collection, de- pending on the types of data. For socioeconomic data, in-person interviews and surveys with house- holds, individuals, and focus groups are common (Chapters 5, 9, 10, and 11;see also Axinn and Ghim- ire, 2011, Neuman, 2005). Government census data and documents are other major sources of data, es- pecially related to the human population such as individuals, households, and communities (Chap- ters 12 and 14). For biophysical data, remote sensing data are increasingly available (Chapters 6 and 7). One of the main types of remote sensing data is sat- ellite data, with various spectral, spatial, and tem- poral resolutions. Field surveys enable researchers to obtain detailed data at fine spatial scales (Chap- ters 4, 6, and 7). To obtain spatial data such as lo- cations of objects (e.g., field sites and activities), a global positioning system (GPS) receiver is widely used (Tomkiewicz et al., 2010). Such data provide a good basis for ground-truthing. Bio-logging, such as telemetry, GPS collars, and animal-borne imag- ing, offers essential information on animals and people, their movements, and life histories (Chap- ter 4; see also Dell et al., 2014).
> After or during data collection and entry, it is ne- cessary to clean the data before use. The cleaning process may help fix data errors and ensure data quality for further analyses. As the data for coupled systems are often big and mixed in terms of data types, it is necessary to manage them effectively and efficiently so they can be easily accessible and w1derstandable.
> The ultimate purpose of collecting, cleaning, and managing the data is to analyze and integrate them to generate useful information and knowledge. There are numerous methods for data analysis,
> including specialized statistical methods (Burn- ham and Anderson, 2002), as well as geographic information systems (GIS). The latter can incorp- orate multiple layers of data for spatial analysis and mapping, and spatial visualization (e.g., Chap- ter 4). Systems modeling is a widely used approach for integrating a variety of data and relationships derived from data analysis to understand complex relationships and dynamics. For example, agent- based models are an increasingly popular bottom- up modeling approach that incorporates detailed information about each object to understand emer- gent properties (Chapters 8 and 14; see also Rails- back and Grimm, 2011). Many visualization tools are available to make information visually access- ible to the reader, including GIS, and computer software programs such as R (R Development Core Team, 2005).
> 2.7 Model coupled systems
> The world is so large and there are so many coupled systems, it is impossible to study every coupled sys- tem in detail for a long time due to constraints of resources (e.g., time, manpower, and money). Thus, innovative approaches are needed to address this challenge. One such approach is the use of model coupled systems, which share important features with many other systems and are studied in depth for a long time. The findings from the model sys- tems can provide insight and enable the design of appropriate research on non-model systems to ad- dress fundamental questions and develop effective policies and management strategies. This approach is ana.Jogous to successful model systems ap- proaches in other fields such as biology, medicine, and ecology.
> In biology and medicine, a large number of model organisms have been used. Model animals include fruit flies (Drosoplzilnmelnnognster,well known as the subject of genetic experiments by Thomas Morgan). Other examples include mice (Mus 11111sc11/11s,classical model vertebrate) and ze- brafish (Daniarerio,ideal for visual observations of internal anatomy). For plants, Arnbidopsisthnlinnn, a member of the mustard (Brnssicncenef)amily (e.g., cabbage and radish) is the most popular model plant. Arnbidopsis thnlinnn is also the first plant to

> been debated for over a century (Ostrom, 2005,
> 
>  26 PANDASAND PEOPLE
> Yang et al., 2013b). Previous literature concluded that the group size effect varies across contexts, which is true but lacks theoretical and empirical guidance for further research and practice (Ostrom 2005). But buttressed by years of work in our model coupled system (i.e., Wolong Nature Reserve), our study depicted the whole picture of a non-linear curve of group size effects on both collective ac- tion and resource management outcomes, and confirmed the general hypothetical mechanisms at play (Yang et al., 2013b). These findings from our model coupled system provide strong evidence that while there are many scale-dependent and context-dependent phenomena in coupled systems, there indeed are also generalizable properties (e.g., causal mechanisms) across scales and contexts. While it should be cautious to extrapolate findings from one coupled system to another, the study of model coupled systems can play a crucial role in pi- oneering new thinking, testing new methods, gen- erating empirical evidence, and guiding research under varied contexts. Ultimately, model systems can help to synthesize empirical data, discover gen-
> eralizable properties and build robust theories to guide decision-making and management practices. Analogous to the well-known model organisms
> and model ecosystems, we have used Wolong Nature Reserve in China (Chapter 3) as a model coupled system since 1996. Our research on this model system seeks to understand the complex- ity of coupled systems and explore the utility of research results in planning, policy making, and governance. The work in Wolong relies on the con- ceptual framework (Figure 2.2 or earlier versions of this framework) presented above. Like almost all other frameworks, the one guiding our research has evolved over time with modifications to some specific components, but its core remains the same. Our work also builds on the theories and utilizes the methods we have highlighted above, which are constantly evolving. The model system approach has taught us a great deal over the years about our system in Wolong, and in turn about coupled hu- man and natural systems in general. The rest of this book details our findings. We begin with an over- view of Wolong (Chapter 3) and then synthesize various research projects we have conducted in Wo- long (Chapters 4-14). We also present highlights of
> the applications of ideas and methods developed in Wolong to some other coupled systems around the world (Chapters 15-18).
> 2.8 Summary
> The ongoing quest to overcome precipitating threats and to strive for global sustainability re- quires a sound foundation for understanding the complex ways in which humans and nature affect one another. In this chapter, we introduced one promising answer to this call-the coupled hu- man and natural systems framework. This frame- work provides a blueprint for analyzing reciprocal interactions and feedbacks between humans and nature. The framework goes beyond previous con- cepts by being more inclusive of diverse human and natural components, by explicitly emphasiz- ing human-nature feedbacks, and by incorporating interactions with other systems. We demonstrated the application of the framework to understanding human-wildlife interactions in a rural setting by characterizing complex interactions between Local Residents, Wildlife, Forests, Policies, and Contex- tual Factors. We also showed how the framework builds on and contributes to theories such as niche
> theory and household production theory. We pro- vided an overview of methods for coupled system research, techniques that bring together individuals from diverse disciplines and backgrounds to ana- lyze and integrate diverse data sets. Examples of cutting-edge approaches include systems modeling such as agent-based modeling. We also put forth the need for intensive, long-term study of model cou- pled systems similar in depth and breadth to classic studies conducted on model organisms (e.g., Dros- ophila) and model ecosystems (e.g., the Galapagos). The rest of this book illustrates our 20-year study of the model coupled system of Wolong Nature Re- serve in China and applications to other coupled systems around the world.

> ## 2.5 Theoretical foundations
> 
> Our understanding of coupled systems (systems formed by the interaction of numerous parts or subsystems) can be expanded by using theories from various fields. The general systems theory provides a foundation, and other theories such as complex adaptive systems, Resilience theory, and Hierarchy theory address specific system attributes. Moreover, insights from disciplines like ecology, economics, and sociology can be beneficial for coupled systems research. Nevertheless, existing theories may need to be further developed to more effectively address coupled systems as they were originally developed in the context of natural or human subsystems.
> 
> Examples of adaptation and evolution to human changes, in contexts such as ecological niches and household activities, can be studied within a coupled systems framework. With more applications and testing of existing theories in coupled systems research, it is possible to revise these theories and even develop new ones.
> 
> ## 2.6 Methods for studying coupled systems
> 
> Studying coupled systems necessitates a multi-method approach and expertise from a variety of natural and social science disciplines. The research process encompasses the human subsystem, the natural subsystem, and their interactions, and it can be divided into three iterative steps: defining system boundaries, setting research goals and questions, and quantifying components and relationships.
> 
> There are various methods for data collection, depending on the types collected. Different procedures are included in data analysis and integration, such as specialized statistical methods and geographic information systems. Systems modeling is broadly used to understand complex relationships and dynamics. Tools like GIS and computer software programs like R make data visually accessible in visualization processes.

> ## 2.7 Model coupled systems
> 
> Given resource constraints, innovative approaches are needed to study coupled systems, such as using model coupled systems studied in depth over time. This approach can inform research on non-model systems and contribute to understanding fundamental questions and developing effective policies related to system dynamics, interactions and scale-dependency. Wolong Nature Reserve in China serves as an example of such a model coupled system.

> ## 2.8 Summary
> 
> The coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach provides a comprehensive way to analyze reciprocal interactions and feedbacks between humans and nature. It is useful in characterizing complex interactions, contributing to various theories, and unifying diverse data sets. The chapter also underscores the importance of intensive, long-term study of model coupled systems.
