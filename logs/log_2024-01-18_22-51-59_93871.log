**user**:
> I am trying to describe a potential future position that I want my university to hire for. They are asking for "Projected Research Returns: Year 1 (F&A net of Cost Share)" (and similar for year 2 and 3).
> 
> I would like to suggest that this person could bring in 1 month of salary in their first year ($10-15k), and 2 months in their second year.
> 
> Do I put down these numbers, or do I put down just the F&A that would be on top of them in a grant? Elsewhere for budgeting I know that F&A is often 60%. 
**assistant**:
> The "Projected Research Returns" section typically asks for the indirect costs, or Facilities and Administration (F&A) costs, that the university would recover from the grants this future hire will bring in. F&A costs cover not only the salary of the researcher, but also infrastructure and administrative overhead involved in conducting the research. Hence, if your university has a standard F&A rate of 60%, this is applied on top of the direct costs (typically salary, equipment, travel, etc.).
> 
> If you're saying this person could bring in 1 month of their salary in their first year ($10-15k), and 2 months in their second year, those sound like direct costs. 
> 
> To calculate the F&A costs (indirect costs), you would typically do the following calculation:
> 
> 1. Enumerate the total direct costs. In your case, it's $10-15k in year 1, and double that in year 2.
> 2. Multiply those direct costs by the F&A rate (60%) to get the indirect costs.
> 
> For instance, if the person's 1 month salary is $10k, and 2 months salary in the subsequent year is $20k:
> 
> - In the first year, the F&A cost would be $10k * 0.60 = $6k
> - In the second year, it would be $20k * 0.60 = $12k
> 
> So, under this calculation, you would put down $6k for Year 1 and $12k for Year 2 in the "Projected Research Returns" section.
> 
> However, please double-check this with your university's guidelines or a local administrator to ensure that you are calculating and presenting these numbers accurately, as there can be variation in this between different institutions.
