> I want to test something using "multi-level logistic regression modeling" in R. Specifically, I have a situation where several respondents are offered prices, and select how much of something they want to sell. I would normally just regress amount sold on price, but a student has done this instead treating every "sell amount" as a different observation, and then regressing the binary indicator of whether a given sell amount was selected against the price and the sell amount. This seems wrong to me, but I want to test it and see if, for example, the inclusion of all of those extra observations makes artificially small standard errors when this is done in a random effects setup. Can you lay this out in R?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! It sounds like the student's approach might lead to issues because it's essentially creating a lot of pseudo-replications by treating each sell amount as a separate binary outcome.
> 
> To properly address this, we should consider a multi-level logistic regression where the binary outcome (i.e., whether a specific sell amount was chosen) is nested within respondents. This will let us quantify the variability both at the respondent level and at the level of sell amount choices, while considering the correlation of sell amounts chosen by the same respondent.

> 
>    - `chosen ~ price + sell_amount`: This specifies your fixed effects, exploring how price and the sell amount itself may predict the likelihood of a respondent choosing it.
>    - `(1 | respondent_id)`: This part captures the random effects, accounting for variations among respondents.

> 4. **Compare with a simpler model**:
>    You might compare this with a simpler logistic regression model that ignores the respondent-level random effects:

>    simple_model <- glm(chosen ~ price + sell_amount, data = data, family = binomial)
>    summary(simple_model)
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Compare the standard errors**:
>    By comparing the standard errors from `model` and `simple_model`, you might see if the student's approach (akin to the simple model but mis-specified) leads to artificially small standard errors.

> This setup should help you explore how the perceived relationship between price, sell amounts, and choice depends on accounting for respondent-level variability. Let me know if you need more clarity on any part or if you'd like further assistance with interpreting the outputs!
**user**:
> Can you set up some example data, with 100 respondents each given 3 price levels and then selecting one of 10 sell_amounts?
> Importantly, the true data-generating process is not with sell_amount on the right hand side, but rather on the left-hand-side. The whole concept of the "chosen" level, as a separate binary variable from the sell_amount, only exists for the student's setup.
**assistant**:
> Sure! Let's create some example data for your scenario. We’ll simulate 100 respondents, each presented with 3 different price levels, from which they will select one of 10 potential sell amounts. As you mentioned, the "chosen" variable is effectively a binary representation of whether a given sell amount was chosen based on price through the logistic regression response.

> ### Explanation of the Code:
> - **Setting Up**: We establish 100 respondents, a set of 3 price levels, and 10 possible sell amounts. Using `expand.grid()`, we create all combinations of respondents, prices, and sell amounts.
> - **Data Generation**:
>   - A log-odds formula is defined using true parameters for intercept and coefficients for price and sell amount. 
>   - This simulates how the probability of selecting a sell amount depends on both the price and the sell amount.
> - **Outcome Simulation**: Using `rbinom()`, we simulate whether each sell amount was chosen based on the computed probabilities.
> 
> ### Next Steps
> Now you have the data prepared to test both the student's approach and the valid multi-level logistic model. You can proceed by fitting the models as discussed previously.

**user**:
> But please make the true data-generating process just:
> sell_amount ~ respondent_intercept + slope * price

> That is, the creation of a binary variable of whether they chose each specific sell_amount happens afterwards, as a kind of post-processing.
**assistant**:
> Got it! Let's adjust the data generation process so that the `sell_amount` is directly generated based on a linear relationship with price, influenced by a respondent-specific intercept and slope. We’ll create the chosen variable afterward, based solely on the generated `sell_amount`.

> ### Explanation of Changes:
> 1. **Random Intercepts and Slopes**: Each respondent now has a unique intercept and slope generated from a normal distribution. This simulates individual differences in the baseline sell amount preference and responsiveness to price.
>   
> 2. **Sell Amount Generation**: The `sell_amount` is now calculated as a direct function of the respondent-specific intercept and slope relative to the price.
> 
> 3. **Chosen Variable**: The binary variable `chosen` indicates whether the generated `sell_amount` was the maximum sell amount for that respondent at that price level, simulating a selection process where respondents choose their optimal amount.
> 
> ### Next Steps
> You can now use this dataset to fit the multi-level logistic regression model as described earlier, comparing it against the student's approach. Let me know if you need any additional modifications or further assistance!
