> ---
> Global Orchestration
> The Global Orchestration scenario depicts
> a globally connected society in which policy
> reforms that focus on global trade and economic liberalization are used to reshape economies and governance, emphasizing the creation of markets that allow equitable participation and provide equitable access to goods and
> services. These policies, in combination with
> large investments in global public health and
> the improvement of education worldwide, generally succeed in promoting economic expansion and lifting many people out of poverty

> are well placed to deal with global environmental problems such as climate change and fisheries decline. However, the reactive approach to
> ecosystem management makes people vulnerable to surprises arising from delayed action.
> While the focus is on improving the well-being
> of all people, environmental problems that
> threaten human well-being are only considered
> after they become apparent.
> Growing economies, expansion of education, and growth of the middle class lead to
> demands for cleaner cities, less pollution, and
> a more beautiful environment. Rising income
> levels bring about changes in global consumption patterns, boosting demand for ecosystem services, including agricultural products
> such as meat, fish, and vegetables. Growing
> demand for these services leads to declines
> in other ones, as forests are converted into
> cropped area and pasture and the services
> they formerly provided decline. The problems
> related to increasing food production, such
> as loss of wildlands, are not apparent to most
> people who live in urban areas. They therefore
> receive only limited attention.
> Global economic expansion expropriates
> or degrades many of the ecosystem services poor people once depended on for survival. While economic growth more than compensates for these losses in some regions
> by increasing the ability to find substitutes for
> particular ecosystem services, in many other
> places, it does not. An increasing number of
> people are affected by the loss of basic ecosystem services essential for human life. While
> risks seem manageable in some places, in
> other places there are sudden, unexpected
> losses as ecosystems cross thresholds and
> degrade irreversibly. Loss of potable water
> supplies, crop failures, floods, species invasions, and outbreaks of environmental pathogens increase in frequency. The expansion of
> abrupt, unpredictable changes in ecosystems,
> many with harmful effects on increasingly
> large numbers of people, is the key challenge
> facing managers of ecosystem services.
> Order from Strength
> The Order from Strength scenario represents a regionalized and fragmented world
> that is concerned with security and protection, emphasizes primarily regional markets,
> and pays little attention to common goods.
> Nations see looking after their own interests
> as the best defense against economic insecurity, and the movement of goods, people, and
> information is strongly regulated and policed.
> The role of government expands as oil companies, water utilities, and other strategic businesses are either nationalized or subjected
> to more state oversight. Trade is restricted,
> large amounts of money are invested in security systems, and technological change slows
> due to restrictions on the flow of goods and
> information. Regionalization exacerbates
> global inequality.
> Treaties on global climate change, international fisheries, and trade in endangered species are only weakly and haphazardly implemented, resulting in degradation of the global
> commons. Local problems often go unresolved, but major problems are sometimes
> handled by rapid disaster relief to at least temporarily resolve the immediate crisis. Many
> powerful countries cope with local problems by
> shifting burdens to other, less powerful ones,
> increasing the gap between rich and poor. In
> particular, natural resourceâ€“intensive industries
> are moved from wealthier nations to poorer,
> less powerful ones. Inequality increases considerably within countries as well.
> Ecosystem services become more vulnerable, fragile, and variable in Order from
> Strength. For example, parks and reserves
> exist within fixed boundaries, but climate
> changes around them, leading to the unintended extirpation of many species. Conditions for crops are often suboptimal, and the
> ability of societies to import alternative foods
> is diminished by trade barriers. As a result,
> there are frequent shortages of food and
> water, particularly in poor regions. Low levels
> of trade tend to restrict the number of invasions by exotic species; ecosystems are less
> resilient, however, and invaders are therefore
> more often successful when they arrive.
> Adapting Mosaic
> In the Adapting Mosaic scenario, regional
> watershed-scale ecosystems are the focus of
> political and economic activity. This scenario
> sees the rise of local ecosystem management
> strategies and the strengthening of local institutions. Investments in human and social capital are geared toward improving knowledge

> TechnoGarden
> The TechnoGarden scenario depicts a globally connected world relying strongly on
> technology and highly managed, often engineered ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services. Overall efficiency of ecosystem service provision improves, but it is shadowed
> by the risks inherent in large-scale humanmade solutions and rigid control of ecosystems. Technology and market-oriented institutional reform are used to achieve solutions

> with the expansion of property rights to ecosystem services, such as requiring people to

> A variety of problems in global agriculture
> are addressed by focusing on the multifunctional aspects of agriculture and a global reduction of agricultural subsidies and trade barriers. Recognition of the role of agricultural diversification encourages farms to produce a variety of ecological services rather than simply

> Innovative capacity expands quickly in

**assistant**:
> Absolutely, here are summaries of the four storylines:
> 
> **Global Orchestration**
> 
> This scenario emphasizes globally connected societies with policies focusing on global trade and economic liberalization to create equitable markets and access to goods and services. It succeeds in lifting many people out of poverty and promoting economic expansion. However, environmental problems are only addressed reactively, making societies vulnerable to unexpected ecosystem shocks. Despite the overall well-being improvements, the demand for ecosystem services rises, triggering issues like loss of wildlands, degradation of ecosystem services, and increased frequency of environmental breakdowns.
> 
> **Order from Strength**
> 
> Order from Strength presents a world that is fragmented and focused on security and protection with a strong emphasis on regional markets. With increased government oversight, there's more regulation, limited movement of goods and information, and stagnation in technological advancement. This results in an exacerbation of global inequality and degradation of the global commons. Ecosystem services become vulnerable and variable, leading to frequent shortages of food and water.
> 
> **Adapting Mosaic**
> 
> In this scenario, the focus is on local ecosystem management strategies backed by increased investment in human and social capital for better understanding and management of ecosystems. Despite the increased focus on local governance, global and regional problems are worsened. Networks are eventually established for better management of the global commons. The learning from successes and failures in local management of ecosystems improves the overall provision of these services.
> 
> **TechnoGarden**
> 
> This is a technology-driven and globally connected world with a strong focus on environmentally beneficial solutions. There's an expansion of property rights to ecosystem services and the development of technology for sophisticated ecosystem management. This leads to a growth of market for ecosystem services and environmental entrepreneurship. This scenario improves the well-being of the world's poor and lifts many into the global middle class. However, over-reliance on technology creates new vulnerabilities and issues, and managing these emergent problems becomes an ongoing challenge.
