> What do rational expectations of prices refer to?
**assistant**:
> Rational expectations of prices refer to the theory that individuals' expectations of future prices are based on their best available information and are therefore rational. This theory suggests that individuals will not be consistently surprised by unexpected changes in prices and that market prices will reflect all publicly available information. It is a key concept in macroeconomics and is often used to analyze the behavior of markets and the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy.

> Can a linear combination of recent prices be used to estimate rational expected prices?
**assistant**:
> It is possible to use a linear combination of recent prices to estimate rational expected prices, but it would depend on the specific context and the assumptions made about the market and the individuals' behavior. One approach that is commonly used in practice is the time series analysis, which involves fitting a linear or non-linear model to the historical data to forecast future prices. However, this approach assumes that the past prices are a good indicator of future prices, which may not always be the case. Additionally, this approach doesn't take into account other factors that may influence future prices, such as changes in government policies, economic conditions, and market sentiment, which can be difficult to quantify and forecast.

> What is the justification for using a linear combination of recent prices to forecast future prices?
**assistant**:
> The justification for using a linear combination of recent prices to forecast future prices is that it is often assumed that the underlying process that generates prices is stationary. Stationarity means that the statistical properties of the time series such as the mean, variance, and autocovariance do not change over time. This assumption allows to use linear models such as the autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA) models to forecast future prices. Additionally, linear models are relatively simple and easy to estimate, interpret and forecast. They are also widely used in practice because they perform well in many cases, and are easy to implement.

> However, it is important to note that this approach is based on assumptions and may not always provide accurate forecasts. In particular, it assumes that the relationship between past and future prices is linear, which may not be the case in some markets. Also, it assumes that the time series is stationary and doesn't take into account any structural breaks or changes in the underlying process that generates prices.

> Why would future prices be a linear combination of recent prices under rational expectations?
**assistant**:
> The assumption that future prices will be a linear combination of recent prices under rational expectations is based on the idea that market participants have access to the same information and that they use this information to form their expectations. This implies that the future price will be a function of the current price, and a set of exogenous variables that are believed to influence the price. The linearity assumption comes from the idea that this function is linear, which means that the influence of each variable on the future price is constant and can be measured by a set of coefficients.
> 
> This linear combination of recent prices and exogenous variables is also based on the assumption of market efficiency, which states that prices reflect all publicly available information. This implies that past prices contain information about the future, and that this information can be used to forecast future prices. Under this assumption, market participants will use the information from past prices and other available information to form their expectations, leading to a linear relationship between past and future prices.
> 
> However, it is important to note that this assumption is based on a number of simplifying assumptions, and may not always hold in practice. Additionally, this linearity assumption is a simplification of real-world scenarios, and even in efficient markets, it's not guaranteed that the relationship between past and future prices is linear.
