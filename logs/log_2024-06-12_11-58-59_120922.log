> Absolutely, I'll provide examples of projects or initiatives that align with DC's Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS), focusing on neighborhood revitalization in low- to moderate-income areas:
> 
> **1. Green Affordable Housing Initiatives**: Collaborate with non-profit organizations focused on creating affordable housing, to incorporate energy-efficient design and technologies within their buildings. These could include insulating walls for energy loss prevention, installing energy-efficient appliances, and incorporating solar panels. Additionally, introduce green incentives for residents such as low-cost composting or recycling programs.
> 
> **2. Community-Solar Projects**: Implementing community solar projects can be a great approach to enhance energy performance in neighborhoods. These are solar-electric systems that, through a voluntary program, provide power and/or financial benefits to multiple community participants. These allow households that may not have access to suitable solar resources, including renters and apartment users, to benefit from solar energy.
> 
> **3. Public Building Retrofitting**: Working with government agencies to retrofit public buildings like schools, community centers, and libraries with energy-efficient measures can be a transformative effort. This could involve installing energy-efficient lighting, HVAC systems, and advanced building automation systems.
> 
> **4. Facilitating Energy Audits**: Facilitate energy audits for older buildings in the community, providing insight into what improvements can be made to enhance energy efficiency. This can
