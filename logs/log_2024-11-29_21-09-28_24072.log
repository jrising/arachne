**assistant**:
> The relationship between installed capacity and costs for green technologies is often described in terms of "learning curves" or "experience curves." Here's how these concepts are generally phrased:
> 
> 1. **Learning Curve**: This term suggests that as the cumulative installed capacity of a technology increases, the cost of producing that technology tends to decrease. This is because manufacturers learn to streamline processes, reduce waste, improve efficiencies, and cut material costs over time.
> 
> 2. **Experience Curve**: Similar to the learning curve, the experience curve emphasizes the reduction in costs as experience in manufacturing grows. This can be quantified as a percentage decrease in cost for every doubling of cumulative capacity.
> 
> 3. **Economies of Scale**: As installed capacity increases, certain economies of scale can be achieved, potentially lowering per-unit costs through the spreading out of fixed costs over larger production volumes and gaining operational efficiencies.
> 
> 4. **Cost Reduction through Innovation**: This refers to both incremental improvements and breakthrough innovations in technology that lead to cost reductions, often as a result of increased R&D and greater installation base providing more data and feedback.
> 
> 5. **Swanson's Law**: Specifically directed at solar PV, Swanson's Law states that the price of solar photovoltaic cells tends to drop by about 20% for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume.
> 
> Describing this relationship often emphasizes the idea that investing in the installation of these technologies now leads to cheaper and more competitive energy solutions in the future, aiding the transition to sustainable energy systems.

> And how do people talk about frictions that add additional hidden costs to adoption of abatement technologies?
**assistant**:
> When discussing frictions that add additional hidden costs to the adoption of abatement technologies, several phrases and concepts are commonly used:
> 
> 1. **Implementation Barriers**: This term refers to obstacles that prevent the seamless integration of new technologies, such as regulatory hurdles, lack of infrastructure, or inadequate workforce skills.
> 
> 2. **Transaction Costs**: These are the costs associated with the exchange of goods or services, which can include search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, and policing and enforcement costs that can make adoption less appealing.
> 
> 3. **Inertia and Status Quo Bias**: This concept highlights the tendency of individuals and organizations to stick with established practices rather than transition to new technologies, often due to perceived risks and uncertainties.
> 
> 4. **Hidden Costs**: This phrase reflects expenses that are not immediately apparent, such as maintenance, training, or integration with existing systems, which can significantly affect the total cost of ownership.
> 
> 5. **Adoption Friction**: This specific term encompasses various challenges that slow down or complicate the adoption of technologies, including bureaucratic delays, lack of incentives, or market volatility.
> 
> 6. **Risk Perception**: This refers to concerns about the reliability and performance of new technologies, which can deter investment and adoption despite potential long-term benefits.
> 
> 7. **Financing Challenges**: Access to capital for investing in new technologies can be limited, adding a financial friction that affects deployment rates.
> 
> 8. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: This refers to fluctuating policies or inconsistent regulations that create an unpredictable environment for adopting new abatement technologies.
> 
> These phrases focus on the complex interplay of economic, social, and institutional factors that influence the decision-making process around adopting green technologies. Addressing these frictions is crucial for facilitating smoother transitions to sustainable practices.
