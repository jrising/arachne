> My name is Jingwen Jiao, and I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Statistics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research in statistics, econometrics, network science and their applications in environmental economics and social sciences has strengthened my resolve to pursue further studies in climate change and climate modeling. I am writing to express my interest in the PhD program at the University of Delaware, particularly under your guidance.
> 
>  
> 
> During my time at UESTC, I consistently excelled academically, achieving a GPA of 3.8/4.0 and receiving multiple scholarships, including the National Scholarship for Postgraduate Students. My active engagement in research led to contributions as a first author in high-impact journals such as "Energy" (Q1, Impact Factor: 9.0) and "Journal of Statistics and Decision Making" and one paper is currently under review at "Nature Human Behaviour". In these projects, I employed econometrics, causal inference, statistical machine learning and complex network analysis to explore topics such as the transmission mechanisms of geopolitical risks to the oil market and the impact of scientific awards on citation networks.

> Beyond my individual research, I have collaborated on interdisciplinary projects that broadened my perspective and skills. For instance, collaborating with Prof. Santo Fortunato from Indiana University, Bloomington, and Prof. Yifang Ma from the Southern University of Science and Technology on " Ripple Effects of Prizewinning in Science" project, I utilized econometrics and data science to uncover the exponential nature of the ripple chain in collaboration networks. Recently, I am working as a research assistant with Prof. Junjie Zhang at Duke University, where I construct a county-level climate risk index, investigating the spillover effects of climate risk on supply-chain networks and measuring the vulnerability of the bank system to climate risk. These experiences underscore my deep passion for research and my ability to tackle complex problems through innovative and interdisciplinary approaches. I am committed to advancing the purpose of research and making meaningful contributions to my field.

> I am particularly interested in your research in climate change and climate modeling, as it aligns closely with my previous experiences and research interests. Your papers on this topic have deeply inspired me, and I am motivated to further my studies in this field. I believe I am an excellent fit for your PhD program for several reasons. I have mastered complex statistical modeling methods and successfully applied them in interdisciplinary contexts. My strong statistical background and interdisciplinary research experience have honed my analytical skills and enhanced my ability to contribute effectively. Also, I possess a strong theoretical foundation in statistics and econometrics, and I am proficient in using data analysis tools such as R, Python, Stata, and GIS. Additionally, I have passed professional qualifications including FRM, CFA, and ACCA, providing me with comprehensive knowledge in finance and economics. These skills and experiences have equipped me to conduct high-level academic research independently.
