**user**:
> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope you are doing well. I, Amlan Biswas, am applying for a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. I am fascinated by the research you conduct at Climate Impact Lab on the impact of climate change on agriculture using econometric modeling along with spatiotemporal visualization. As a graduate of the agricultural discipline, I found your impressive profile very convincing that I can unleash my potential and talent under your guidance. Thus, I wanted to know if you had any openings and whether I would be a good fit for your group.
> 
> I reviewed your paper titled “Crop switching reduces agricultural losses from climate change in the United States by half under RCP 8.5” and was astonished by the thoughtful suggestions you made using the Bayesian hierarchical model to mitigate the impact of climate change by relocating cropping areas according to temperature patterns. I also authored four journal papers in a similar discipline exploring agricultural agents' preferences for rice varieties in Bangladesh and tried to find extension linkages and training impact on the agricultural production process. I am keen to learn spatiotemporal techniques to visualize data, eventually, I would like to use these techniques to find sustainable technological uses to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture and the environment.
> 
> I feel a connection with your research interest and I believe I can contribute to the research areas of empirical estimates and integrated assessment modeling on the impacts of climate change. I am motivated to pursue a career as an academic researcher and would appreciate your kind consideration.  I have attached my CV. If you have any questions or want to know more about my academics, please let me know so we can discuss this over Zoom or Skype. Thank you for your time.
> 
> I look forward to hearing from you soon.

> Dear Amlan Biswas,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your research focus and interest in applying econometric modeling and spatiotemporal visualization to the study of climate change impacts on agriculture aligns well with our work. 
> 
> The Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware might be a good fit for you. Note, however, that funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I encourage you to address your interest in my research and how it aligns with your goals in your statement of purpose. This will help the admissions and funding committees understand your fit and funding needs within the program.
> 
> Given the impressive work you've already done, especially your research on agricultural agents' preferences for rice varieties in Bangladesh, we might have quite the symbiotic relationship. I encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds.
> 
> I hope you understand that while it's far from guaranteed, your chances of admission and securing funding could increase by demonstrating your fit with the existing research being conducted in the department. And your initial email has made a excellent start at doing just that.
> 
> Best,
>

> Can you shorten this while including a comment that I do not expect to have additional funding myself, but funding may be available through the University, which they can be considered for if they apply before the end of the year.
