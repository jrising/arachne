> I've seen seemingly unrelated regressions used as a way of dealing with the fact that many different coefficients are estimated and some might be found to be significant just by chance. Is that standard?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the method you're asking about is known as **Seemingly Unrelated Regression** (SUR), and it is a standard method in econometrics when dealing with multiple equations with different dependent variables but a potentially connected error structure. This relationship between the error terms in different equations could indicate, for instance, that the equations share some common, unobserved factors.

> However, I believe you're mixing two distinct concepts: SUR and **Multiple Comparisons Problem** (MCP). The latter refers to the increase in Type I error (false positives) that occurs when multiple hypotheses are tested at the same time. To correct for this, various methods have been devised, such as Bonferroni correction, Šidák correction, False Discovery Rate, etc.

> SUR does not directly deal with the MCP. Instead, SUR is a method to improve coefficient estimates when there may be correlation of errors across different regression equations. If you're worried about finding significant results just by chance due to multiple testing (the MCP), you might want to look into these correction methods instead of, or in addition to, using SUR.
