> In an academic paper on the impact of climate change on countries, I want to group by continent. For those not on a continent, is it better to say "Open Ocean" or "Seven Seas" (I see them labeled as "Seven seas (open ocean)" in one dataset), or something else?
**assistant**:
> For clarity and consistency in an academic paper, especially concerning the impact of climate change on countries, it's best to use a term that is widely understood and unambiguous. "Open Ocean" is a straightforward and clear designation. While "Seven Seas" might have historical context and some usage, "Open Ocean" more directly communicates the idea of areas not bounded by continental definitions. This term is likely more familiar in current scientific literature.
> 
> Hence, I recommend using "Open Ocean" for countries or areas not associated with any continent. This ensures clarity for your readers.
