> I have a dataframe in R with multiple counties (column County), and multiple time periods (Time), and several value columns. How can I make this extra-wide, so that there's just one row for each County?
**assistant**:
> To transform your long-format dataframe into a wide-format one in R, you can use the `spread()` function from the `tidyverse` package. First, you'll need to install and load the `tidyverse` package if you haven't already:
> 
> ```R
> install.packages("tidyverse")
> library(tidyverse)
> ```
> 
> Next, you can use the `spread()` function to reshape your data. Assuming your data frame is called `df`, and you have a value column named `Value` that you want to spread, you can do the following:
> 
> ```R
> wide_df <- df %>%
>   spread(key = Time, value = Value)
> ```
> 
> This will create a new dataframe called `wide_df`, with one row per `County` and a separate column for each unique `Time` value.
> 
> If you have multiple value columns, you can use `spread()` in combination with `gather()` to first gather all the value columns into a single column and create an additional column to identify the original value column. For example, let's say you have two value columns `Value1` and `Value2`:
> 
> ```R
> long_df <- df %>%
>   gather(key = "variable", value = "value", Value1, Value2)
> 
> wide_df <- long_df %>%
>   unite("Time_variable", Time, variable) %>%
>   spread(key = Time_variable, value = value)
> ```
> 
> This will create a new dataframe called `wide_df` with one row per `County` and a separate column for each unique combination of `Time` and value column.
