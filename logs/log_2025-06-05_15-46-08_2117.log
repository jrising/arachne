> How can I use mutate across in dplyr to replace NAs in a range of columns with "0"?
**assistant**:
> In `dplyr`, you can use `mutate()` combined with `across()` to apply a function to a selection of columns. To replace `NA` values with "0" in a range of columns, you can use the `coalesce()` function, which is handy for replacing `NA` with a specified value.

> # Example data frame
> df <- data.frame(
>   a = c(1, NA, 3),
>   b = c(NA, 2, NA),
>   c = c(4, NA, 6)
> )
> 
> # Replace NAs with 0 in specified columns
> df <- df %>%
>   mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ coalesce(., 0)))
> 
> print(df)
> ```

> In this example:
> - `where(is.numeric)` is used to select columns based on their data type, ensuring only numeric columns are modified. Alternatively, you could specify a range of columns using `across(c(col1, col2, ...))`.
> - `coalesce(., 0)` replaces `NA` values with "0".
> - Make sure that the type of the replacement value is compatible with the column type; in this case, "0" is numeric, matching the data type of the columns.
