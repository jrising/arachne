> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I’m a recently graduated student and I am hoping to learn more about admissions to programs related to the School of Marine Science and Policy. I am unsure if you are someone that I should be reaching out to, the university’s website suggested reaching out to a faculty member.
> 
> I am beginning my search in programs and inquiring about best routes of success due to by educational background in languages/international studies. I do not have a degree in a science field or related, however I am motivated and passionate about changing my career focus. I have taken conservation/marine law related courses during my undergraduate degree and recently, at the graduate level at a local university and found that I am very interested in pursuing marine ecology or related. I would like to know if there is a path forward at the university for someone in my situation without receiving another bachelor's degree.

> Based on Sophie's background in languages and international studies with some coursework in conservation/marine law, it's clear that she is considering a career shift into marine ecology or a related field. Her inquiry is focused on understanding the best path forward given her educational background. Here's my draft response:

> Considering your interest in marine ecology and related areas, it sounds like you may be a good fit for a few programs within the University of Delaware's School of Marine Science & Policy. For someone transitioning from a non-science background, you might find the Ph.D. in Marine Policy well suited, given its flexibility for non-traditional students or those with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
> 
> Another exciting option is the new Masters in Environmental Science & Management, which offers a Marine track. This program is designed for students like yourself who are passionate about marine science and policy and are seeking a comprehensive educational experience.
> 
> To help streamline the process of finding the right program for you, could you please fill out the following form?

> 
> This will allow us to provide guidance that is tailored to your interests and background. If you have strong quantitative skills, you might also consider the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics, though the funding here is quite limited and applications are encouraged by December 1 for full consideration.
> 
> We would be happy to work with you on identifying the best program for your goals.

> Dear Sophie,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your background and interests!
> 
> Given your motivation to transition into marine ecology and related fields, I recommend considering the Master's in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) at the University of Delaware. This program is designed to accommodate diverse academic backgrounds and combines elements of marine science with policy and management, making it a great fit for someone with your profile.
> 
> While the admission timeline for this year has ended, I encourage you to keep this program in mind for the future. It provides a comprehensive foundation for students looking to engage in marine and environmental issues, particularly for those willing to bring a unique perspective from their previous studies in languages and international affairs.
