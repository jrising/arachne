> How does the EU ETS use benchmarking to allocate free permits?
**assistant**:
> The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) uses benchmarking as a method to allocate a portion of the emission permits, known as 'free allowances', in an attempt to prevent carbon leakage.  Carbon leakage is a situation where businesses transfer their operations to countries with less stringent emission restrictions to lower their costs, leading to an increase in global emissions.
> 
> Here’s how the benchmarking process works:
> 
> 1. **Creation of benchmarks**: Benchmarks are set based on the average performance of the top 10% most efficient installations in a sector or subsector in the EU. These are established in terms of emissions per unit of output or activity. The output or activity might be tonnes of steel produced, tonnes of cement clinkers, MWh of electricity, etc.
> 
> 2. **Determination of allocations**: The number of free allowances allocated to each installation is determined by multiplying the established benchmark by the historical activity level of the installation. It's important to mention that from Phase 3 onward (2013 - 2020), the activity level is not based on a single year but involves an average over a number of years, typically three to five years.
> 
> 3. **Cross-sectoral correction factor**: In case the total number of allowances calculated in step 2 is above the maximum number of allowances that can be allocated for free, a cross-sectoral correction factor is applied. This is a uniform percentage reduction applied to all benchmarks to align the total allocation with the cap.
> 
> 4. **Adjustment**: There is the possibility of adjustments in free allocations in case of significant changes in an installation’s production levels. The installation can apply for an increase or decrease in the number of allowances if their activity level changes by a predefined amount.
> 
> This benchmark-based allocation method aims to reward efficiency and promote green technological innovation in industries. The most efficient installations could potentially sell excess allowances if they can maintain their emissions below the benchmark level. On the other hand, less efficient installations would need to either improve their performance or buy additional allowances in the market to comply with emissions requirements.
**user**:
> Can you give me some equations showing the determination of allocations? I'm confused how you would multiply a performance level (Units / tCO2) by an emissions level (tCO2 or Units?) and get out a number of permits (tCO2).
**assistant**:
> I understand the confusion. Let's break down the process with a simplified example:
> 
> Let's say we have an installation in the steel sector with a benchmark performance level of 0.5 Units/tCO2. The historical activity level of the installation is 1000 Units (e.g., tonnes of steel produced). 
> 
> The determination of allocations can be explained as follows:
> 
> 1. **Benchmark Calculation**:
>    Benchmark = 0.5 Units/tCO2
>    
> 2. **Emissions Calculation**:
>    If the installation's actual emissions intensity is 0.8 tCO2 per Unit produced:
>    Emissions = 0.8 tCO2/Unit * 1000 Units = 800 tCO2
> 
> 3. **Calculating Free Allowances**:
>    Free Allowances = Benchmark (0.5 Units/tCO2) * Activity Level (1000 Units) = 500 tCO2
> 
>    In this example, the installation would be allocated 500 tCO2 worth of free allowances based on its benchmark performance level and historical activity.
> 
> The process involves multiplying the benchmark performance level (Units/tCO2) by the historical activity level (Units) to get the emissions associated with that activity. These emissions are then compared to the actual emissions of the installation to determine the amount of free allowances it should receive.
> 
> It's important to note that in the EU ETS, allowances are typically measured in tonnes of CO2 (tCO2). The use of performance levels in different units (such as Units/tCO2) is a way to standardize and compare emissions intensity across different installations and sectors. This approach incentivizes improvements in efficiency and emissions reductions.

> How does Phase 3 handle new entrants, who don't have 3-5 years of activity?
**assistant**:
> In Phase 3 of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which took place from 2013 to 2020, new entrants (installations that did not have a historical activity level of 3-5 years) were handled through a process called "benchmarking allocation to new entrants". This process aimed to allocate free allowances to new installations in a fair and transparent manner while maintaining the overall environmental integrity of the system.
> 
> Here is how Phase 3 accommodated new entrants:
> 
> 1. **Benchmarking Allocation to New Entrants**:
>    
>    - **Establishment of Benchmark**: For new entrants without a historical activity level, a benchmark was established based on the sector average or other relevant data. This benchmark typically reflected the average emissions performance of existing installations in a similar sector or subsector.
>    
>    - **Determination of Allocations**: New entrants were allocated free allowances based on their expected level of activity and the established benchmark. The allocation was calculated by multiplying the benchmark emissions intensity by the expected level of activity of the new entrant.
> 
> 2. **Verification and Adjustment**:
>    
>    - **Verification Process**: New entrants were required to provide information on their expected activity levels and emissions intensity to receive free allowances. This information was subject to verification by the relevant authorities to ensure accuracy.
>    
>    - **Adjustment Mechanisms**: In cases where the actual activity levels of new entrants deviated significantly from their initial estimates, adjustment mechanisms were in place. New entrants could apply for adjustments to their free allocation if their activity levels differed from the initial projections by a certain threshold.
> 
> 3. **Transition Rules**:
>    
>    - **Phased-In Compliance**: New entrants were typically subject to phased-in compliance obligations, allowing them to gradually adapt to the emissions trading system. This helped smooth the transition for new installations and ensured a fair treatment compared to established facilities.
> 
> Overall, the benchmarking allocation to new entrants in Phase 3 aimed to integrate new installations into the EU ETS smoothly while promoting emissions reductions and efficiency improvements from the outset. The process sought to strike a balance between supporting new entrants' competitiveness and ensuring environmental effectiveness within the framework of the emissions trading system.
