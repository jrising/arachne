> Google docs is keeping my paragraphs together when I would really prefer that it break them up (because I need to keep a page limit). How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> If Google Docs is keeping your paragraphs together and you want them to break up to stay within a page limit, you can try a few adjustments:
> 
> 1. **Check Paragraph Settings**: Make sure there’s no special formatting applied that could be affecting how paragraphs break across pages.
>    - Go to `Format` > `Line & paragraph spacing` and ensure options like `Add space before/after paragraph` are set to minimal values.
>    - Select the paragraphs and right-click to choose `Paragraph options`. Check that there is no unusual spacing before or after paragraphs.
> 
> 2. **Remove Keep with Next or Widow/Orphan Control**:
>    - These settings can sometimes prevent paragraphs from splitting across pages. While Google Docs doesn’t have a direct "keep with next" option like Word, it does have basic rules.
>    - You can try manually adjusting by slightly altering the line spacing or font size at smaller intervals to encourage breaking.
> 
> 3. **Adjust Margins**:
>    - If spacing isn’t shifting paragraphs as needed, reducing the top or bottom margin may provide extra room for breaks.
>    - Go to `File` > `Page setup` and adjust the margins there.
> 
> 4. **Manually Insert Page Breaks**:
>    - If an automatic solution doesn’t work, you can insert manual page breaks where you see fit.
>    - Place your cursor where you want to add a page break, and then go to `Insert` > `Break` > `Page break`.
> 
> Adjusting any combination of these settings should help you control how your paragraphs are distributed across pages. Let me know if you need further assistance!
