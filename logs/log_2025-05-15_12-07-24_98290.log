> In dplyr, how can I group by something, and then set a column to a value if there was only one thing in the group?
**assistant**:
> In `dplyr`, you can accomplish this by using the combination of `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `if_else()` functions. Here is an example of how you can implement this:
> 
> ```r
> library(dplyr)
> 
> # Example dataframe
> df <- data.frame(
>   group = c('A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C'),
>   value = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
> )
> 
> # Use dplyr to group, check group size, and set column value
> result <- df %>%
>   group_by(group) %>%
>   mutate(new_value = if_else(n() == 1, 100, value))
> 
> print(result)
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> - We first group the data frame by `group` with `group_by()`.
> - Then, we use `mutate()` to add or modify a column called `new_value`.
> - Inside `mutate()`, we use `if_else(n() == 1, 100, value)` to check if the group size is 1 using `n()`. If true, it sets `new_value` to 100; otherwise, it retains the original `value`.
> 
> This approach efficiently applies the condition to each group in the data frame. Adjust the column names and values as per your specific use case.
