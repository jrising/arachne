> The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Said another way, using subsets of the indicators would have produced a more accurate or robust result, and as new indicators are added beyond this, the value of the analysis was reduced. Vulnerability is not, as section 2.2.3 suggestions, sector agnostic.

It will be also clearer for me, to distinguish what you would consider desirable or optimal (but perhaps cannot suggest to adopt a different approach at this point in time) and what specific corrective measures you think they could and should implement

> 
> MOE: Very few of the identified KPI will evaluate the success of the proposed solutions. Almost all are either driven by much larger macroeconomic features (e.g. unemployment rate), or climate hazards over which MOE has essential no control (e.g., accumulated precipitation). Most importantly, these do not evaluate the success of the solutions themselves; obvious KPIs such as usage levels of the SCS and CAE, and post-intervention surveys of the AWAR students, are completely missing.
> 
> Lappeenranta: The choice experiment is not an intervention. Also, the indicator table (Table 6) mainly has intended outcomes, with hints of the indicators in the “units”. However, these are not sufficiently clear. There is a separate “Approach to monitor impacts” section, but it is not clear if it is related to the Flood Vulnerability column from Table 6.
> 
> Oristano: (1) According to the document, the Coastal Contract was already developed, covering Oristano, in 2001. It appears that the work described as being under TransformAr was already within the scope of the existing agreement. (2) Seven SMART GATES are part of the NBS General Masterplan, and it is not clear how the gate co-contributed by TransformAr is intented to relate to these other planned projects.

> 
> **MOE:** Please revisit the identified KPIs, as very few currently evaluate the success of the proposed solutions. Many are driven by larger macroeconomic features (e.g., unemployment rate) or climate hazards over which MOE has no control (e.g., accumulated precipitation). Focus on developing KPIs that specifically evaluate the success of the solutions themselves. Consider adding KPIs such as usage levels of the SCS and CAE, and post-intervention surveys of the AWAR students.
> 
> **Lappeenranta:** Please note that the choice experiment is not an intervention. Ensure that the indicator table (Table 6) clearly reflects specific indicators rather than merely intended outcomes, and specify these indicators in the "units" section. Clarify the relationship between the "Approach to monitor impacts" section and the Flood Vulnerability column from Table 6.
> 
> **Oristano:** 
> 1. Clarify if the Coastal Contract developed in 2001, which included Oristano, encompasses the work described under TransformAr, or if there are new components now being developed.
> 2. Explain how the TransformAr-contributed gate is intended to relate to the other planned projects within the existing NBS General Masterplan, which includes seven SMART GATES.

> 
> Generally, this deliverable does not appear to satisfy the proposed outcomes. The WTP estimates are for generic reductions in damages, rather than any actual adaptation measures. The adaptation costs are only available for DIVA’s standard set of coastal practices. A proper CBA could have been done, using actual costs and either observed or specifically elicited WTP-based benefits, and then benefit transfer techniques used to extrapolate, but this was not done.

> 
> A cost-benefit evaluation could provide an important input into future planning processes and improve the project's impact. However, please clarify whether the current results constitute justifiable quantitative information.
> 
> **Key Benefits Question:** Please directly address how much of the damages will be avoided, as this is critical. The DCE assumes certain levels of damage reduction, which limits its ability to provide this information.
> 
> **COACCH Coastal Adaptation Data:** Ensure that the evaluation takes into account not only engineering costs but also other kinds of adaptation costs. Additionally, note that the COACCH adaptation scenario labeled “incremental adaptation” appears to be essentially a business-as-usual adaptation, which does not align with the project's vision or the DCE.
> 
> **NUTS2 Region Reporting:** Clarify that adaptation costs are reported per person for the entire country, but this information should be specified across each NUTS2 region. This reporting method cannot support a NUTS2-level benefit-cost ratio.
> 
> **Willingness to Pay (WTP) Values:** The standard approach for translating WTP values to other regions typically assumes a linear-in-logs relationship. Please provide justification for using a linear-in-levels relationship instead, as nothing in the discussion currently supports this change.
> 
> **Comparison of Results:** Please clarify that the WTP results reflect a private benefit rather than the public benefit that is presumably of concern to policymakers.
> 
> Overall, this deliverable does not appear to meet the proposed outcomes. The WTP estimates refer to generic reductions in damages, rather than any specific adaptation measures. Additionally, adaptation costs are only provided for DIVA’s standard set of coastal practices. A thorough CBA should have been conducted using actual costs alongside either observed or specifically elicited WTP-based benefits, and then employing benefit transfer techniques for extrapolation; however, this process was not completed.
