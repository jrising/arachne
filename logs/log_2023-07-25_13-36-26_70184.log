> When installing Ubuntu, it says that installing 3rd party drivers requires secure boot, and won't allow me to use a short password. Will I need to use this password often?
**assistant**:
> No, you won't need to use this password frequently. The password is needed primarily for two reasons:
> 
> 1. When making changes to the kernel modules, such as installing new ones or updating existing ones. This might happen when updating system software, for example.
> 
> 2. When booting up your computer, if Ubuntu cannot verify the integrity of its kernel modules because of secure boot, you may need to enter the password.
> 
> However, these situations do not occur very often for most users, and Ubuntu will memorize this password so you won't be asked for it for every little change. 
> 
> Keep in mind though, that this password is very important and should be kept securely as losing it could potentially complicate the process of making system-level changes.
