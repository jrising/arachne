> How can I set up a voice command on Android that passes some text to a url? Like, I would like to say "QueryMax what is the best pizza in London?" and it loads a special QueryMax page (this is a made up name for a service I could build) that I've set up with that query?

> Sure, implementing a voice command that interacts with a specific URL on your Android device involves a number of steps. Below, I'll walk you through how to accomplish this:
> 
> Firstly, you will need a way to convert voice to text. You can do this using Google's built-in Google Assistant or apps like Tasker, along with a plugin called AutoVoice.
> 
> Secondly, you will have to create the actual task for your service, QueryMax.
> 
> Here's how you can set it up using Tasker and AutoVoice:
> 
> 1. **Install the necessary apps:** Install Tasker and AutoVoice from the Google Play Store. Note that AutoVoice requires Tasker to function.
> 
> 2. **Configure Tasker:** Open Tasker and enable its Accessibility service and Notification Access via Android settings, as prompted.
> 
> 3. **Configure AutoVoice:** Open AutoVoice and go through its tutorial and setup process.
> 
> 4. **Set up a voice command:**
>    
>   - In Tasker, tap on the "+" button to create a new profile.
>    
>   - Select "Event" and go to the "Plugin" category.
>    
>   - Choose AutoVoice and then "Recognized".
>    
>   - Tap on the pencil icon next to "Configuration" to set up the voice command.
>    
>   - In the field marked "Command Filter", enter your voice command (e.g., "QueryMax") and choose the language of the command.
>    
>   - Hit the tick mark to confirm and go back.
> 
> 5. **Define the task:**
>    
>   - You will be asked to associate a task with the new profile. Choose 'New Task'.
>    
>   - Name your new task (e.g., "Launch QueryMax").
>    
>   - Now you will create the actions that this task will perform.
>    
>   - Tap the "+" button to add the first action. Choose "Net" and then "HTTP Get". 
>    
>   - In the Server:Port field, enter the URL of your QueryMax service. For example, if your service can handle GET requests in this format, "http://querymax.com/search?q=[your-query]", you would replace "[your-query]" with the variables that contain the converted voice command. In Tasker, you represent this as "%avcommnofilter", so it would look like this: "http://querymax.com/search?q=%avcommnofilter".
> 
> 6. **Linking to a web browser:**
>    
>   - We're almost there! The final stretch. After providing the request to the server, we need to actually load the result.
>    
>   - After the HTTP Get action, add a new action. This time, choose "System" then "Send Intent".
>    
>   - In "Action," put "android.intent.action.VIEW".
>    
>   - In "Data," put "%HTTPD". This is where Tasker keeps the result of the last HTTP action.
>    
>   - And in "Target," select "Activity."
> 
> 7. **Test and adjust the task:** Finally, hit the back button to finalize the task and profile. You may want to test the task to ensure it's working properly and fine-tune if necessary.
> 
> This will set up your Android device so that when you say, "QueryMax what is the best pizza in London?" your device will send a GET request to "http://querymax.com/search?q=what is the best pizza in London" (or whatever URL your service uses), and then open a browser with the results of that request.
> 
> Remember to replace "http://querymax.com/search?q=%avcommnofilter" with your actual service URL. Also, note that this method depends on your QueryMax service being able to handle GET requests with a "q" query parameter in the URL.
