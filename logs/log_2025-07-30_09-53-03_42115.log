> Dear Professor Dr. Rising,
> 
> Happy Summer! I hope this email finds.you well.
> 
> I am writing to request a letter of recommendation from you in support of my application to a fellowship opportunity in Iceland, namely Hindu Kush Himalaya - Arctic Youth Leadership Forum. This one-year fellowship program aims to engage youth leaders from climate vulnerable regions, specifically Himalayan and Arctic countries, to strengthen their understanding in climate actions and solutions. I am profoundly interested in attending in this program.
> 
> As I worked under your guidance on a project connecting sustainable planning, climate resilience and biodiversity preservation, a letter from you would greatly strengthen my application. The deadline is July 31st, and I would be happy to provide any materials you may need. Please let me know if you would be willing to support my application.
> 
> [Later, he offered: "Focus on my degree related to climate and environment, my work under your guidance on climate and sustainability data and project will be immensely helpful. I am also attaching my letter of interest."]
> 
> Thank you for considering this request. I truly appreciate your time and support.

> Overview
> The Earth’s cryosphere – its frozen water – is rapidly disappearing, changing life dramatically in two of the most climate-vulnerable regions: the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) and the Arctic. The HKH is warming at twice the global average; the Arctic is warming nearly four times faster. At the heart of this crisis are the young people of these regions, who are already feeling the impacts on their homes, cultures, and the future. More than passive observers, they are custodians of ecological knowledge, stewards of biodiversity, and key stakeholders in building resilient futures.
> 
> The HKH–Arctic Youth Leadership Forum, facilitated by ICIMOD and Arctic Circle, aims to connect youth leaders from both regions to build solidarity, amplifying local and mountain youth voices towards co-creating sustainable and inclusive climate solutions.
> 
> Through a one-year fellowship, 12 youth champions (aged 19–35) will gain the knowledge, skills, and networks to lead from the frontlines, bringing local realities and experiences to global climate platforms.
> 
> And here are some things I would like to say (which you can edit):

> It is my pleasure to recommend Juboraj Pavel for ...
> I worked with Pavel for over a year during his Masters on a project for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). The project was to inform DNREC's plans to understand and improve the use of Delaware's ocean, bay, and coasts, to ensure long-lasting sustainability and economic productivity. Our goal was to synthesize the available data on uses of these natural spaces and identify the  data gaps. Pavel was central to this work, showing off his wide range of skills. He evaluated many dozens of datasets, analyzing them quantitatively and understanding them holistically in the context of the planning process. He developed code, graphics, and spreadsheets to use the information. He was central in writing up the final reports for DNREC, drawing upon a wider range of literature. And he did it all while staying organized, consistent, and cheerful.
> He even volunteered his time after he had his degree to rework our material into an academic publication.

> I am writing to enthusiastically recommend Juboraj Pavel for the Hindu Kush Himalaya - Arctic Youth Leadership Forum fellowship. It was my pleasure to work closely with Juboraj during his Masters in Marine Policy, where his dedication and expertise shone brightly in a collaborative project with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). This project aimed to enhance Delaware's ocean and bay usage through sustainable planning, a challenge that Juboraj met with various skills and remarkable dedication.
> 
> Juboraj's work focused on synthesizing the available data regarding the uses of natural spaces and identifying data gaps. His ability to evaluate numerous datasets was exemplary, as he conducted both quantitative analyses and holistic assessments within the planning context. His proficiency with developing code, graphics, and spreadsheets greatly enhanced our capabilities to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively to stakeholders.
> 
> His role in drafting the final reports for DNREC was invaluable, drawing from a diverse literature network to provide comprehensive insights. Juboraj displayed not only technical skills and critical thinking but also a strong organizational capacity and a positive collaborative spirit. Impressively, even after completing his degree, he volunteered his time to rework our findings into an academic publication, demonstrating his continued dedication and commitment to meaningful environmental work.
> 
> Juboraj is undoubtedly a stellar candidate for your fellowship. His experience in climate resilience projects, combined with his academic rigor and unwavering passion for sustainability, makes him an ideal fit for this opportunity. The engagement with the program will empower him further in his aspiration to contribute impactful climate solutions.
> 
> I have no doubt that Juboraj will bring his enthusiasm, leadership, and a wealth of knowledge to the Forum, much like he has done in our previous projects. I wholeheartedly support his application and am confident he will make a meaningful contribution to the goals of the HKH–Arctic Youth Leadership Forum.

> Can you also add some material about the strength of his program as a Masters of Marine Policy for understanding issues of sustainability and climate action?
> 
> Here is a description of the program:
> 
> Students in the Marine Policy Program develop expertise in the theory and practice of policy and governance, policy analysis, and policy research related to the management and protection of marine resources, ocean and coastal ecosystems, and coupled natural-human environments.
> 
> The Marine Policy Program examines the economic, legal, political, and social aspects of the world ocean, the seabed, and the coastal zone. Students and faculty in the program analyze public issues regarding the law of the sea, ports and shipping, marine minerals, ocean and coastal zone management, fisheries, Naval affairs, marine biotechnology, and the global environment, frequently making recommendations for policy at the regional, national, and international level.
> 
> This multidisciplinary academic program is designed to give students a strong foundation in policy analysis integrating the disciplines of social and economic sciences, physical and life sciences, governance and technology policy.  Students have opportunities to focus on their desired area of expertise and acquire state-of-the-art policy research and policy analytical skills, while working closely with our Marine Policy faculty.
> 
> The program is particularly appropriate for students with social and political science, economics and social science, and/or marine science backgrounds. Successful students include persons with experience in public or private sectors returning to advance marine policy expertise and recently graduated students continuing their matriculation with focused interests related to marine policy.  The MP program is committed to supplying exciting research opportunities, access to diverse science and policy activities, and a stimulating educational environment for students.
