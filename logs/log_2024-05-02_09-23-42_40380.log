> How does crop insurance in the US work? Like, under what conditions do farmers get payouts?
**assistant**:
> Crop insurance in the United States is primarily managed under the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), which is administered by the Risk Management Agency (RMA) of the USDA. Farmers who choose to purchase crop insurance choose between several types of coverage:
> 
> 1. **Yield Protection Policies**
>    These policies insure producers in the event of a loss in yield (the amount of crop harvested per acre) due to natural events such as droughts, excess moisture, cold wet weather, frost, wildlife, diseases, and pests.
> 
> 2. **Revenue Protection Policies** 
>    These policies cover loss of revenue caused either by a drop in prices, a drop in yield, or a combination of both.
> 
> 3. **Whole-Farm Revenue Protection Policies**
>    This policy offers a risk management safety net for all commodities on the farm under one insurance policy and insurable income includes revenue from farming and ranching.
> 
> Additionally, farmers may qualify for catastrophic risk protection which provides minimal coverage (covering losses exceeding 50 percent of the average yield and pays 55 percent of the price of the commodity) for a nominal fee.
> 
> Payouts occur when the harvest yield or revenue falls below the insured level, which typically covers a large percentage of a farmer's projected yield or revenue. The specific conditions that would trigger a payout can vary based on the type of policy, the specific crop, and the location where it's grown.
> 
> The premiums for these insurance policies are substantially subsidized by the federal government (on an average rate of 60%), making it more affordable for farmers.
> 
> In addition to these programs, there's also the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) which provides financial assistance to producers of non-insurable crops when low yields, loss of inventory, or prevented planting occur due to natural disasters.
> 
> These insurances aim to maintain the viability of farming communities, stabilize food prices, and ensure a reliable supply of produce across the country.
