> When a paper on climate data mentions that it "conservatively re-grids" data from one grid to another, it is describing a specific method for translating information between grids of different sizes or shapes.
> 
> The term "conservative" in this context refers to the process preserving certain properties of the original data. Specifically, it means the total amount (or integral) of the data across the entire grid remains constant after re-gridding.
> 
> For example, if we are re-gridding rainfall data from a fine grid to a coarser one, we want to ensure that the total amount of rainfall over a given geographic region remains the same before and after re-gridding. We don't want any rainfall to be "lost" or "gained" in the process.

> A conservative re-gridding approach is typically used when we want to preserve the physical meaning and constraints of the data while changing the resolution of the grid. It can be more complex than other re-gridding strategies, as it often requires careful weighting of data points to ensure conservation.
