> **Pilot Vessel**
> 
> A Pilot Vessel is a type of boat used to transport maritime pilots between land and the inbound or outbound ships that they are piloting. Maritime pilots are skilled professionals who possess detailed knowledge of navigable waterways. Their job is to guide ships safely into harbors or through dangerous or congested waters.

> **Tug versus Towing Vessel**
> 
> Although the terms "Tug" and "Towing Vessel" are often used interchangeably, there can be a distinction between them. 
> 
> A "Tug" (or tugboat) is a powerful craft designed to maneuver vessels by pushing or towing them. They are typically used in harbors to assist with docking large ships, but they are also used in open water to tow barges or disabled vessels.
> 
> A "Towing Vessel" is a broader term that can include tugs but also other kinds of craft that are designed to pull, or tow, other vessels. For example, offshore supply vessels that service oil rigs can sometimes function as towing vessels.
> 
> **Reserved or Other Types**
> 
> "Reserved" or "Other Types" are categories used to classify ships that don't fit into any standard categories, or their specific functionality is not disclosed. Hence, it can be tricky to infer the activities or uses of these ships directly from AIS data. They could include research vessels, decommissioned or repurposed military vessels, privately owned yachts, or experimental watercraft, among others. 
> 
> It might be possible to infer more about their activities by examining other data, such as their movement behavior, call sign, flag, ports of call and changes over time.
