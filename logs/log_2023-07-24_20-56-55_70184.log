**assistant**:
> Yes, James, keeping cherries in the refrigerator is a great way to prolong their freshness. However, there are also a few other steps you can take to maximize their shelf-life:
> 
> 1. **Examine before storing**: Before you store your cherries, be sure to look them over for any fruit that's bruised, cut, or otherwise damaged. These cherries will hasten the spoilage of the rest of the batch.
> 
> 2. **Don't wash until you're ready to eat**: Cherries stay fresh longer if you don't wash them until just before you're ready to eat or use them. Any residual moisture can lead to faster spoilage.
> 
> 3. **Refrigerate in a plastic bag**: Cherries keep best when they're stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. The bag helps to maintain humidity which can help keep the cherries fresh.
> 
> 4. **Freeze them for long term storage**: If you have more cherries than you can use before they spoil, consider freezing them. Simply wash, dry, pit them if you'd like, and place them in a single layer on a baking tray in the freezer. Once they're fully frozen, you can transfer them to a freezer-safe bag for long-term storage.
