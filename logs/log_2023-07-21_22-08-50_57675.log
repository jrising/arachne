> If X ~ N(0, sigma), what is the mean of exp(X)?
**assistant**:
> The mean of an exponential of a normally distributed random variable (in this case `X` with mean `0` and standard deviation `σ`), also called the log-normal distribution, is given by `exp(μ + σ²/2)`. 
> 
> With `μ` (mean of X) being `0` and `σ` (standard deviation of X), the mean of `exp(X)`, is `exp(0 + σ²/2) = exp(σ²/2)`.
