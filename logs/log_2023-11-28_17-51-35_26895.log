**user**:
> A group has a tool with an MIT License, and they want to include components from a package that I have made with a GPL v3.0 license. What restrictions does my license place on people who use their tool?
**assistant**:
> The GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.0 is a copyleft license. This means that it permits users to use, modify, and distribute your code under the same license terms. 
> 
> If a group with an MIT License were to incorporate components from your GPL v3.0 licensed package, they would encounter a few restrictions:
> 
> - **Preservation of the GPL License:** They must keep the original GPL v3.0 license of your components intact, and any derivative works they produce with your material must also be released under the same terms (GPL v3.0).
> 
> - **License Compatibility:** MIT license is a permissive license whereas GPL v3.0 is a copyleft license. If they incorporate your GPL v3.0 code into their MIT-licensed project, the entire project essentially becomes GPL v3.0 licensed, due to the 'viral' nature of the GPL, which requires that derivative works must also be GPL-licensed.
> 
> - **Source Code and Modifications:** They must make the source code, including any modifications they make, available to anyone who receives the software/binary. This is another condition of copyleft licenses.
> 
> - **Disclose changes:** If they make changes to your code, they have to identify those changes.
> 
> - **No additional restrictions:** The GPL v3.0 explicitly forbids the addition of further restrictions to the license. So they cannot add any further limitations on the use, modification, or distribution of your code.
> 
> Remember, legal advice should always be taken from a professional. This explanation reflects only a general interpretation of the GPL v3.0 and MIT license terms and how they traditionally interact. Please consider discussing with a legal advisor for specifics on your situation.
