> Can I change the "owner" of a pull request in github?
**assistant**:
> GitHub doesnâ€™t allow changing the "owner" (i.e., the original author) of a pull request directly. The person who created the pull request remains the author, and there's no built-in functionality to transfer authorship.
> 
> However, you can achieve a similar result with a workaround:
> 
> 1. **Close the Original Pull Request:** The current owner can close the existing pull request without merging it.
> 
> 2. **Branch from the Same Source:** The new "owner" can create a new branch from the same source branch that was used to create the original pull request.
> 
> 3. **Create a New Pull Request:** The new owner can then open a new pull request from their branch to the target branch, effectively becoming the "owner" of the new pull request. To preserve history and maintain clarity, it would be beneficial for both pull requests to reference each other in the comments.
> 
> 4. **Include Contributors:** You can recognize the original author by attributing or mentioning them in the commit messages or pull request description/comments of the new PR.
> 
> These steps provide a way to reassign responsibility for a pull request while maintaining the integrity and context of the proposed changes.
