**assistant**:
> Great question, Austin! Many houses are made of bricks because bricks are strong, they last a long time, and they can help keep a house warm in winter and cool in summer. Plus, aren't they a bit like the bricks the Three Little Pigs used to keep the big bad wolf out? Now, can you tell me, if you were building a house, what would it look like? Would it have a place for a dragon or a pirate to visit?
