**user**:
> What's a term to describe a methodology that studies multiple steps in a process independently, and then builds a stronger view of them from the fact that they build-upon eachother. The sentence is: "The use of both model-based and statistical approaches across these three [TERM] levels of analysis provides multiple lines of evidence." I think a term like "incremental" is almost right, but what I really mean is "building-upon-like".
**assistant**:
> The term you might be looking for is "cumulative". The term "cumulative" in the context you provided implies that each step or level of the analysis is building upon the previous one, adding additional depth and complexity. 
> 
> So your sentence would read: "The use of both model-based and statistical approaches across these three cumulative levels of analysis provides multiple lines of evidence."
