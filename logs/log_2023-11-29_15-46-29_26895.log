**user**:
> I have vegetable broth that has a best if used by date of Sep. 20, 2022. So, it's just over a year later. Is it still good?
**assistant**:
> If your vegetable broth was properly stored (in a cool, dry place), and the can or box is in good shape (no dents, swelling, or rust, and it's not leaking), it's likely safe to consume. The "best if used by" date usually refers to the product's quality and *not* safety so the broth won't necessarily be bad or harmful after this date. However, the flavor, color, or texture might not be as good.
> 
> What's most crucial is checking the condition of the package:
> 
> 1. Check for visible signs of spoilage, like mold.
> 2. If it's in a can, listen for a "pop" sound when opened. No popping sound could indicate an improper seal.
> 3. Make sure it smells normal when you open it.
> 
> If the broth isn't abnormal by any of these measures, it should be fine to use. When in doubt, it's always safest to throw it out. But remember, one of the ways we can address food waste is by acknowledging that "best by" dates may encourage throwing away food prematurely.
