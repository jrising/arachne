**user**:
> How can I replace all values in a dataframe in R that are NA with 0?
**assistant**:
> You can use the `replace_na()` function from the `tidyverse` package, or the `is.na()` function in base R to replace all NA values with 0 in an R dataframe. Here are examples of both:
> 
> **Using `tidyverse`:**
> 
> ```r
> library(tidyverse)
> 
> # Assuming df is your dataframe
> df <- replace_na(df, list(column1=0, column2=0))  # replace NA in specific columns
> df <- replace_na(df, list_if(is.character, "Unknown", if_else(is.numeric, 0, NA)))  # replace NA in all columns
> ```
> 
> **Using base R:**
> 
> ```r
> # Assuming df is your dataframe
> df[is.na(df)] <- 0  # replace NA in all columns
> ```
> 
> In the base R example, `is.na(df)` generates a Boolean matrix of the same size as `df` where each NA value is represented as TRUE. The `<- 0` then replaces these TRUE values (the NAs) with 0.
