**user**:
> I want to use the coqui TTS system to synthesize speech, but it looks like it might only be for pay. Is it free or for pay?
**assistant**:
> Coqui TTS, as of their last updated policy in September 2023, operates under an open source license, meaning it is free for use. However, they also offer a paid API, which provides a simpler way for companies and developers to use their technology.
> 
> The open source version can be installed and run on your own servers or local machine, but it requires some technical knowledge to set up and use effectively. 
> 
> The paid API offers a more streamlined way of accessing the technology with a consistent, well-documented interface. The cost varies depending on the workload and usage.
> 
> It's important to note that the open source project may not offer all the features that are available in the paid API, and the level of user support will also differ. Do be sure to review the terms of use for any specific restrictions or guidelines. 
> 
> So, in short, it is both: you can use the software for free if you install it yourself, or you can opt for the paid service for a more convenient and comprehensive package.
**user**:
> I would like to use it for free. How do I do this?
**assistant**:
> To use the Coqui TTS system for free, you can follow these general steps:
> 
> 1. Set up your development environment: Ensure that you have the necessary software and dependencies installed on your computer. Coqui TTS is built using Python and TensorFlow, so make sure you have them installed.
> 
> 2. Clone the Coqui TTS repository: Go to the Coqui TTS GitHub page (https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) and clone the repository to your local machine. This will give you access to the source code and models.
> 
> 3. Download pre-trained models: Coqui TTS provides pre-trained models for different languages and voices. You can download the desired model(s) from the Coqui TTS models repository (https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS-Models) and store them in the appropriate location within the Coqui TTS codebase.
> 
> 4. Install the required Python dependencies: Navigate to the Coqui TTS repository and install the necessary Python packages by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line or terminal. This will ensure that you have all the required libraries to run Coqui TTS.
> 
> 5. Generate speech using the TTS system: With the models and dependencies in place, you can now use the Coqui TTS system to synthesize speech. Refer to the Coqui TTS documentation and examples for guidance on how to generate speech from text using the specific language and voice model you have chosen.
> 
> Remember to comply with the terms of the Coqui TTS open source license and any other applicable licenses or agreements. It's also a good practice to acknowledge and provide attribution to Coqui TTS when using their technology.
> 
> Please note that the steps provided here are a general outline, and you may need to refer to the official Coqui TTS documentation and repository for more detailed instructions specific to your operating system and requirements.
