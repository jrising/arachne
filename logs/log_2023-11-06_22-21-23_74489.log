> Estimating Current Climate Losses - Project Proposal
> PI: James Rising, University of Delaware
> 
> Context: The planet has already warmed by 1.34 Â°C [1.2 - 1.5 Â°C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. Under one expert review of global damages, this suggests that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion. In poor, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be significantly greater.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> Deliverable: This project will develop best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome will be percent reductions in GDP per capita and percent reductions in capital wealth, in 2023, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP per capita is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels. A recent estimate of GDP losses, combining three of these results and produced by the PI for a previous ECF-funded project on the cost of climate change in the UK, is shown below.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses will provide new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change. The losses would also be reported as a global average and for various regional and country groups (e.g., LLMICs, G77, Sub-Saharan Africa).
> 
> Annually varying loss estimates will underlie these results, which will reflect greater losses in years with heat waves and in later years as climate change accelerates. We will develop short case studies from the EU and LLMICs will compare these GDP losses to other reported impacts of recent heat waves.
> 
> The estimates will be produced as part of a short report made initially available to the sponsors Nov. 1, 2023, and for release during COP 28. The work will then be prepared for academic publication.
> 
> Unique contribution: To produce these results, we bring together existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate (see Table under Points of Methodology). Over the past decade, this literature has proposed many different approaches to understanding the effect of climate on GDP, including investigations of the differential vulnerability of poor countries, the role of persistent losses to growth, and the potential of adaptation. Current attempts to synthesise this literature are limited to simply averaging the results. Using a machine learning model, calibrated to the results from this literature, we will produce an estimate that reflects the most advanced features of all of these papers.

> We will use ERA5 reanalysis weather data to produce historical projections of climate effects, available 1940 - present. To construct the counterfactual without climate change, we will resample values from the baseline period (1940 - 1960). A key question in the literature is the extent to which impacts put countries on a permanently lower growth trajectory. This was carefully analysed in a previous paper of the PIâ€™s, and the resulting uncertain distribution of persistence will be used here.
> 
> Drawing upon both the headline estimates and additional results in the paper will provide evidence across the space of possible combinations of model elements. A random forest model will then be fit to these models, informed by meta-data about each. Finally, the random forest will be queried for damages from a model that simultaneously represents high-quality features in all model categories.
> 
> As an additional line of evidence, we will use the previously mentioned Howard & Sterner meta-analysis of damage results derived from expert elicitation. This provides both a measure of catastrophic risk, which will be applied uniformly across the globe, and an estimate of non-catastrophic global losses, which can be used as a loose constraint on the sum of the machine learning results.

> 
> Here are bullet points for the results to be discussed in this section:
> 
>  - Global population-weighted GDP loss in 2022 is 6.4% [IQR 2.4 - 8.5%], accounting for direct, international, and capital losses. As a percentage of global GDP, however, that is a loss of 0.6% [3.6% loss to 1.9% gain]. This is because of the significant benefits experienced by many richer countries.
>  - Losses are considerable across the Global South, with double-digit losses in many areas of the tropics and averaging 10% across Africa in 2022 (Fig. #FPMAP). Southern Africa shows the largest regional losses at 17% of GDP (Fig. #FPECO).
>  - In contrast, much of Europe and northern Asia shows benefits from climate change (5% for Europe and 7% for Central Asia, Fig. #FPREG), driven by reduced winter chill.
>  - The United States shows a benefit of 2% of GDP, while China shows no change (Fig. #FPMAP).
>  -  This exacerbates global inequality. Averaged across the developed world or OECD, there are almost no current aggregate losses from climate change [IQR 3% loss to 5% gain]. In contrast, low income countries show an average 11% loss of GDP [6 - 15%].
>  - In terms of total dollars (constant 2015 USD), GDP in high-income countries has increased an estimated $287 billion due to climate change, while the rest of the world has lost $1217 billion (see #LEVELCHANGE).
>  - The majority of these losses are direct impacts from local temperature. International impacts increase losses by approximately 1 pp for each country outside of Europe and North America. Capital effects increase losses by 1 - 2 pp in most regions.

> ## Draft for Results and Findings

> ### 2022 Impacts
> 
> The year 2022 was marked by several tangible impacts of climate change. The global population-weighted GDP loss was found to be 6.4% [IQR 2.4 - 8.5%], accounting for the combined effects of direct changes in the climate, international shifts in trade and commerce, and long-term changes to capital accumulation. When expressed as a percentage of the global GDP, the effect amounts to a loss of 0.6% [IQR 3.6% loss to 1.9% gain]. This minor global effect, however, belies the significant disparities emerging between different regions and countries. 
> 
> Taking a closer look at the findings, the Global South has been greatly affected, with many key regions in the tropics experiencing double-digit losses (see Figure #FPMAP). In Africa alone, the GDP losses averaged 10% for 2022. Among the African regions, Southern Africa took the hardest hit, suffering from a 17% loss of GDP (Figure #FPECO).
> 
> Figure #FPMAP showcases how significant the contrast in climate change impacts is across different geographies. Europe and Northern Asia, for instance, have seen economic benefits from climate change, estimated at growths of 5% and 7% in GDP respectively (Figure #FPREG). These gains can primarily be attributed to a reduction in colder weather, which in turn has reduced heating costs and increased agricultural productivity.
> 
> Notably, the United States also shows a 2% benefit in GDP, while China's economy remained unaffected in 2022 (Figure #FPMAP).
