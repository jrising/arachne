> From a linux prompt, how can I see what drives I could mount?
**assistant**:
> You can use the `lsblk` and `fdisk -l` commands to see a list of available drives and partitions that you could mount. 
> 
> To use `lsblk`, run:
> ```sh
> lsblk
> ```
> 
> This will give you a tree-like structure of all block devices, showing their mount points, if any.
> 
> To use `fdisk -l`, you might need superuser privileges, so you would run:
> ```sh
> sudo fdisk -l
> ```
> 
> This will list all partitions and some additional information about the disks, which can help you identify which devices are available for mounting.
> 
> Additionally, you can use:
> ```sh
> blkid
> ```
> to get more detailed information about the filesystems on the partitions, which is useful to know before mounting them.

> For example:
> - `/dev/sda1`
> - `/dev/sdb2`

> These are typical representations of partitions you might see, and you can mount any of them using the `mount` command accordingly.
