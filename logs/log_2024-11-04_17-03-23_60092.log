> Dear James,
> 
> I am hoping I can convince you to apply to our newly advertised faculty position in the Bren School at UCSB.  As you may have seen, we are looking for an exceptional environmental economist who uses modern data science as part of their research.  You were on the short list of people the search committee flagged as having exactly the kind of research trajectory we are looking for and I sincerely hope you will apply!
> 
> The full position details can be found here.  We are able to hire at the assistant or associate level and the salary will be very competitive.
> 
> I know that you already know about our group here, but let me provide some highlights.  First, we have a highly productive, collaborative and supportive group of environmental economists spread across several departments (Economics, Bren, Geography, Env. Studies); UCSB is an extremely productive place to work and we prioritize a healthy work/life balance.  Second, UCSB is highly interdisciplinary, but also rewards deep contributions in environmental economics.  I know that will resonate with you. Third, we have built a research center called the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) which is a great way to get involved (if you so choose) in applied economics research with agencies, NGOs, and other high-impact partners.  Finally, we are looking for an economist who can also contribute to our master's in environmental data science at the Bren School.
> 
> We sincerely hope you will apply and I would be happy to talk one-on-one with you if any questions arise.  Just let me know if that would be helpful and we can set up a time to talk.

> When a faculty member moves from one institution to another, what happens with the phd students that he was funding/advising?
**assistant**:
> When a faculty member moves from one institution to another, the fate of their PhD students can vary based on several factors, including university policies, the nature of the faculty member's departure, and the agreements in place at both institutions. Here are the typical scenarios:
> 
> 1. **Students Stay at the Original Institution**:
>    - **Continuity of Education**: The PhD students may remain at the original institution and continue their research under the supervision of another faculty member. Often, the department will assign an interim advisor or a committee to support the students.
>    - **Transfer of Funding**: If the funding was tied to the faculty member's grant, students may need to secure new funding sources to continue their work.
> 
> 2. **Students Move with the Faculty Member**:
>    - **Transfer to the New Institution**: If a PhD student wishes to follow their advisor, they can often transfer to the new institution, assuming the new institution accepts them. This may require reapplying, meeting new admission criteria, and possibly securing new funding.
>    - **Continuation of Funding**: If the faculty member's funding follows them, students may retain their financial support, but this depends on the funding agency's policies.
> 
> 3. **Joint Supervision or Retirement of Students**:
>    - In some cases, faculty may negotiate arrangements where they remain involved with their students at the original institution while transitioning to the new role, leading to joint supervision.
>    - Students may also finish their degrees under the original advisor's supervision without participation from the new role.
> 
> 4. **Program-Specific Policies**:
>    - Different institutions have varying policies regarding graduate students' rights and responsibilities, so the specific situation can be influenced by those institutional guidelines.
> 
> 5. **Student Input and Agency**:
>    - PhD students typically have some say in their path moving forward. Their preferences will play a role in whether they stay or transfer. 
> 
> In summary, the outcome depends on institutional policies, funding situations, and the students' preferences, making the transition a nuanced process.
