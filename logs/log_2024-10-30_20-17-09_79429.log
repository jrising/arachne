> Dear Prof. James Rising,

>

> My name is Ms Onyinyechi Chinenye Aghanwa. I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree with Second Class honors (Upper-division-2008) with a Cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.86 on a scale of 5 points in Maritime Management Technology and a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree (2017) with a Cumulative Grade Point Average of 4.16 on a scale of 5 points in Marine Transport Management both from Federal University of Technology Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. I am looking forward to starting a Phd  in  Marine Studies at the University of Delaware, United State of America  by September 2024 Fall Admission/Applications. I desire to work under your supervision.

> 
> I am interested in studying at the University of Delaware, United State of America particularly in your research laboratory which focuses on impacts of climate change thereby bringing together empirical estimates and integrated assessment models. Your research also focuses on modeling of social-environmental systems with concentrations on complex systems, food and fisheries, and resource management.
>

> My research tends to focus on “Assessment of the Impact of flooding on coastal areas”. Climate change threatens increased levels of flooding in the coastal and riverine flood plains. The coastlines change shape over time through natural processes, with climate change, human activity and existing flood defense putting many homes, businesses, and coastal communities at risk of flooding and abandonment. Coastal management techniques (Hard Engineering) is one approach that will aid the management of risk of erosion and flooding. This involves the placement of artificial structures which are used to stop or slow the natural processes of erosion, flooding and sea-rise level. I intend working with this tool to enable me to find solutions to the coastal and flooding issues ravaging the coastal communities. I have also embarked on a training programme on disaster management where I gained knowledge on these modules: risk assessment and mitigation, emergency preparedness and response, recovery and reconstruction, disaster management policies and governance.
> 
> 
> 
>  In my pursuit of a Master's degree (M.Sc.), I did courses in Maritime Safety and Security, Management of Marine Environment, Maritime Transportation and Risk Analysis, Port Operations and Management, Marine Insurance Law and Policy, Management of Ship operations, Maritime Engineering, For my B.Tech (Honors) dissertation, I conducted research on; ‘’Survey of Inland Water Transportation in Anambra State (Nigeria)’’. This has enabled me to gain research skills that will be an advantage in the pursuit of my doctoral degree.
> 
> My long-term career plan and goals is to become a Maritime Instructor and Safety Consultant, solving problems that may demand my expertise skills in the maritime industry. After my graduate studies, I intend cooperating with government agencies in Nigeria to work on a master plan and policies that will support mitigation of climate change. I will also volunteer and get involved with conservation organizations in Nigeria to sensitize and educate residents of the coastal communities on the knowledge of climate change and the adaptation measures.

> Furthermore, I would like to inquire if fully-funded research opportunities are available in your research laboratory. I exchanged email with you prior to submitting an application for Fall 2024 admission. However, I was not successful, possibly because I submitted after funding consideration deadline.

> 
> 
> I look forward to a favorable response from you and will appreciate the opportunity to further discuss with you on how my skills and strength can best serve your research group.

> 
> Dear Ms Onyinyechi Chinenye Aghanwa,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your academic background and research interest align well with work occurring at the University of Delaware, and you certainly have a strong foundation in this area. However, it seems there is some confusion surrounding the exact program of interest.
> 
> You mentioned that you wish to start a PhD in Marine Studies. In our university, we have a Ph.D. in Marine Policy, and another, preferred one Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. Both of these could be good fits, depending on the exact nature of your objective. The former is good for non-traditional students or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds, while the latter is preferred particularly for those with a substantial quantitative foundation and/or specific interest in environmental economics.
> 
> Please note that funding is always a constraint in our ability to take Ph.D. students. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds.

> My name is Ms Onyinyechi Chinenye Aghanwa from Nigeria, a prospective student for a PhD in Environmental Economics (Fall 2025). I submitted application last year, however, I was not successful possibly because I submitted after funding consideration deadline.
> 
> I have been in touch with you in April this year (See mail trail). You affirmed that my academic background and research interest align well with work occurring at the University of Delaware, and that I certainly have a strong foundation in this area.
> 
> You encouraged me to apply by the end of this calendar year so that I can be considered for any available funds. I have submitted application again for the above programme. However, I am unable to pay the $75 application fee. I humbly write to appeal for your assistance and support, so that the application fee be waived for me to enable me successfully submit my application. Due to the sporadic increase in foreign exchange rate (US dollar) with no corresponding increase in minimum wages in my home country Nigeria which has resulted in adverse economic hardship, I am finding it extremely difficult to pay the application fee.

**assistant**:
> Thank you for your detailed email and for sharing the previous correspondence. Based on Onyinyechi Aghanwa's current email, here are the core questions and points of confusion:
> 
> 1. **Inquiry on Application Fee Waiver**: Onyinyechi is seeking assistance with the $75 application fee due to economic hardship. 
> 
> 2. **Clarification on Programs and Supervision**: While Onyinyechi is interested in a PhD in Environmental Economics, the earlier correspondence indicated confusion between Marine Policy and Environmental Economics programs.
> 
> 3. **Alignment with Research Interests**: Onyinyechi expressed a desire to work under your supervision due to shared interests in climate change impacts and modeling.
> 
> She seems genuinely interested in the University of Delaware’s programs that align with your research focus. Here is a draft response considering these points:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Onyinyechi,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your continued interest in our programs at the University of Delaware.
> 
> I appreciate your dedication and understand the challenges posed by economic circumstances. However, the University of Delaware's policies on fee waivers are handled administratively, and I have limited ability to influence this process personally. I recommend contacting the admissions office directly to inquire about potential fee waivers; they may have specific provisions for international applicants facing economic hardships.
> 
> In terms of program fit, it seems you are leaning towards the PhD in Environmental Economics, which aligns well with my research in climate change risks and interdisciplinary modeling. Please note that this program requires a strong quantitative background, and I encourage you to highlight any relevant skills and experiences in your application.
> 
> To help you further identify the best academic program and understand key considerations, I invite you to fill out the program interest form here: [Program Interest Form](https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7). This will assist both you and our faculty in determining the best pathway forward.
