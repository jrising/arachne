**user**:
> In jquery, I have some html returned by an ajax request. Now I want to wrap it in a ul tag and then append it to an element. How do I do that?
**assistant**:
> Firstly, you must ensure that the HTML returned by the AJAX request is wrapped inside some kind of HTML element such as a `li` tag if it isn't already, because `ul` tags typically contain `li` elements.
> 
> Secondly, here's how you can wrap the retrieved HTML inside `ul` tags and append it to an element using jQuery:
> 
> ```javascript
> $.ajax({
>   url: 'endpoint-url', // Your AJAX endpoint.
>   method: 'GET',
>   success: function(data) {
>     // `data` is the HTML returned by the AJAX request.
> 
>     // Assume data is a string of HTML <li> tags.
>     var wrappedData = $('<ul>').html(data); // This wraps your data in a ul tag.
> 
>     $('#elementId').append(wrappedData);  // This appends the wrapped data to the element with id 'elementId'.
>   }
> });
> ```
> 
> In the code above, replace `'endpoint-url'` with the URL of your AJAX endpoint, and replace `'#elementId'` with the jQuery selector for the element you want to append the wrapped HTML to.
