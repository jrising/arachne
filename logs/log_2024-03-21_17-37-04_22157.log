> Dear Dr. James,
> 
> Thank you very much for your feedback. I am glad to hear about the potential opportunities at the University level. Please, kindly keep me posted as they come. I am also on the lookout for the open of application for the Fulbright scholarship program for international students. The application for this scholarship typically opens between late spring and early summer of every year. I will be grateful for other potential funding sources if you come across any as we proceed in the scheme of things.

> Dear Dr. James,
> 
> I hope my email finds you well. Thank you for your responses and attention to my inquiries, which support my pursuit to join the Department of Environmental Science and Management at the University of Delaware for my MS program in the Fall 2024 semester. I also appreciate the kind support of the ESM department and the graduate admission office for helping to retain and defer my admission due to the unavailability of study funds. I am still passionate about my interest in joining the department this Fall. I am writing to you as a gentle reminder about graduate assistantships that may be available to me within the department as the Fall semester is fast approaching. I later discovered that I was not eligible for the Fullbright scholarship I mentioned in my previous email.
> 
> Since I deferred my admission to the Fall 2024 term, I would also like to know the required steps to take (if any) as I look forward to registering for the semester.
> 
> Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

> Dear Paul,
> 
> I appreciate your continued interest in our Department of Environmental Science and Management.

> Regarding funding opportunities, at present, I am not aware of any specific ones within the department. However, I recommend checking the University's job board for graduate students, which often lists assistantships and other opportunities: [https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/grad/current-students/professional-development/jobs-for-grads/](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/grad/current-students/professional-development/jobs-for-grads/). Although it does not have much now, new possibilities may come up as we progress into the spring season.
> 
> Concerning your enrollment for the Fall 2024 term, I would be happy to put you in touch with Sharon, who will guide you through any necessary steps required for registration.

> Should you have any further questions or if you'd like to discuss this in more detail, please feel free to schedule a virtual meeting with me at your convenience using this link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).
