> This is a sample of a few database columns related to benefits, monetary valuation, and Internal Rates of Return, or IRRs. The text provides details on the distribution of dividends in projects that quantify all three types.
> 
> The sub-sector of sustainable agriculture reports development benefits as dominating, with dividends distributed at five point one percent, sixty-three point five percent, and thirty-one point seven percent. In the forestry and landscapes sub-sector, social and environmental benefits dominate, with dividends at thirty-seven point one percent, nineteen point three percent, and forty-three point seven percent. The health sector sees development benefits also dominating, and dividends are at thirty-three point six percent, forty-two point one percent, and twenty-four point three percent. 
> 
> In resilient cities, development benefits and avoided losses are comparable. Dividends are recorded as thirty-seven point four percent, thirty-eight percent, and twenty-four point six percent. The transport sector reports that avoided losses dominate, with dividends labeled at ninety-five percent, two point two percent, and two point seven percent. 
> 
> Within water resources and flood management, avoided losses and social or environmental benefits are comparable, although figures for divisable percentages were both poorly formatted and incompletely read on this instance. 
> 
> In the water supply and sanitation sub-sector, avoided losses and social or environmental benefits are comparable. Observing total averages across all twenty-seven outlined projects, the dividend values are evenly distributed at about one-third each, with figures showing thirty-five point eight percent, thirty-three point seven percent, and thirty point five percent. 
> 
> Please note that green shading in a table format illustrates the higher percentage dividends for each sub-sector.
> 
> In the accompanying image, there is a table detailing three projects with their respective benefits and economic data.
> 
> Here’s a breakdown of these projects.
> 
> The first is the Weather and Climate Services Regional Project. It includes dividends, such as avoided losses and induced economic benefits. Benefits consist of improved weather forecasting, reducing loss of life through early warning systems, and improved service delivery. Monetary values here are fifty-nine million, thirty-four million, and ten point five million U.S. dollars. The Economic Internal Rate of Return is seventy-five point zero seven percent.
> 
> The second project is the Sao Paulo Sustainable Transport Project, which includes dividends like avoided losses, induced economic benefits, plus social and environmental benefits. Improvements in this project are recorded as reduced repair costs, improved travel times, road performance, and reductions in greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions. Monetary values for this project read as four hundred three point fifty-five million, nine point fifty-five million, eleven point sixty-four million U.S. dollars. Its Economic Internal Rate of Return is forty-eight percent.
> 
> The final project noted is the West Africa Coastal Areas Resilience Investment Project two. This involves dividends of avoided losses and social and environmental benefits, including avoiding damages in defined areas and curbing emissions reductions. Collectively large monetary values for this take are forty-two point one million, one hundred thirty-two point one million, fourteen point eighty-five million, forty-two point eighty million, eight point six million, and one hundred fifty-three point sixty million U.S. dollars. The listed Economic IRR is eight percent.
> 
> The table includes dropdown filters on various columns, and certain descriptions have been abbreviated for complex terms like "GHG emissions reductions" and "tCO2e." Indications in the table point to calculation or formula cells, which suggests hidden notes or deeper data behind the shown values.
