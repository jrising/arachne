> ---
> The natural science perspective: There exists an imminent risk of pervasive, long-term disruption of the environment due to continued GHG emissions. Impacts are non-linear, so that warming beyond 1.5°C will result in significant, systemic, and unforeseen disruptions in the systems that people rely upon. This will have potentially dire consequences for vulnerable communities worldwide. As a result, the scientific consensus advocates for rapid decarbonization.
> 
> The economic perspective: Economists largely agree that benefits of substantial decarbonization outweigh its costs, and a suite of policies should be enacted to reduce further warming. However, poverty reduction is also a priority, with large, immediate effects including a greater resilience to climate impacts. The observed capacity of humans to adapt suggests that no likely climate impacts will undermine sustained economic growth, so any transition to a green economy should similarly avoid doing so.

> Rather than suggesting that these are two extremes on an alarmism spectrum, we find compelling points in each.

> Your current description does an adequate job of capturing the different perspectives between the natural sciences and economics communities. However, to better elucidate the "long-term disconnect", I suggest emphasizing how these communities perceive and treat uncertainties and the role they play in shaping their approaches to climate change:
> 
> ---
> 
> The natural science perspective: From this viewpoint, there exists a near-certain risk of extensive, long-term disruption of environmental systems due to continued GHG emissions. Impacts are non-linear, meaning that warming beyond 1.5°C will likely lead to drastic, systemic disruptions in natural processes and services that humans depend on. This could have catastrophic repercussions, especially for the world's most vulnerable communities. Amid these high-stake scenarios and uncertainties, the scientific community endorses the preventative principle — advocating for swift and extensive decarbonization.
> 
> The economic perspective: Economists broadly concur that climate change necessitates substantial policy intervention. In their view, the economic incentives for decarbonization are clear - the long-term benefits often outweigh the immediate costs. However, they also weigh climate action against other urgent global priorities such as poverty eradication, which has more immediate, tangible impacts, including building resilience against climate change. Economists also rely heavily on the observed historical human capacity for adaptation, postulating that future climate impacts will not undermine sustained economic growth. This ability to mitigate risks through adjustment underlies their belief that the transition to a green economy should be measured, avoiding severe shocks to current economic systems.
