> What is a standard criteria for distinguishing rich from poor countries?
**assistant**:
> There are several standards or criteria used to distinguish "rich" countries from "poor" ones. Here are some common indicators:
> 
> 1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita:** This is the most commonly used economic measure. It's calculated by dividing the GDP of a country (the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given year) by the population of the country. Countries with a higher GDP per capita are typically considered wealthier.
> 
> 2. **Gross National Income (GNI) per capita:** Similar to GDP, but it also includes income from overseas investments and from foreign residents. 
> 
> 3. **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):** This measures how much a standard set of goods cost in each country, accounting for differences in the cost of living and inflation rates between countries.
> 
> 4. **Human Development Index (HDI):** This measure is used by the United Nations and takes into account life expectancy, education, and income per capita. It provides more holistic picture of the well-being of a country's residents, going beyond purely economic indicators.
> 
> 5. **Poverty Headcount Ratio:** This is the proportion of a country's population that lives below the international poverty line â€” currently defined as $1.90 per day by the World Bank.
> 
> A single criterion may not provide a comprehensive view of a country's wealth, so these indicators are often used in combination to assess the economic strength and quality of life in a country.
