> What's an adjective for when unnecessary extra words are added, when the main word is already clear?
**assistant**:
> The adjective you're looking for is "pleonastic." It refers to the use of more words than those necessary to convey meaning, which is redundancy in speech or writing.
**user**:
> Great. Is there a more common word that's used?
**assistant**:
> Yes, a more commonly used word for this concept is "redundant."
