**assistant**:
> The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to index lists with a boolean array (`indices`), which does not work directly with Python lists. However, you can convert your lists to NumPy arrays, which support this type of indexing. Here's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:
> 
> ```python
> import numpy as np
> 
> regionvalues = np.array([self.byregion_cache[region][key] for region in self.regions])
> pop_baseline = np.array(self.pop_baseline)
> 
> indices = ~np.isnan(regionvalues)  # Create a boolean mask for non-NA values
> 
> # Ensure `pop_baseline` and `regionvalues` have compatible shapes
> if len(pop_baseline) != len(regionvalues):
>     raise ValueError("pop_baseline and regionvalues must have the same length")
> 
> weighted_average = np.average(regionvalues[indices], weights=pop_baseline[indices])
> 
> self.global_cache[key] = weighted_average
> ```
> 
> By converting both `regionvalues` and `self.pop_baseline` to NumPy arrays, you can apply boolean indexing to efficiently filter out the NAs and compute the weighted average. Additionally, I've added a sanity check to ensure that `pop_baseline` and `regionvalues` are the same length before indexing them, which is usually a good practice when handling data of this nature.
