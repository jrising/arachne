> I am designing a new language, consisting only of the letters N, I, and O. Below I provide some information about the language, and then I have questions.
> 
> The meaning of words is related to the letters that make them up,
> 
> O denotes the definite, active, and immediate; and can be used for the first person pronoun, nomative case, active voice, present tense, indicative statements, and to denote verbs.
> 
> I denotes the observable or dependent; and can be used for the second person pronoun, genitive case, reflexive voice, future tense, interrogative statements, and to denote adjectives and adverbs.
> 
> N denotes the unknown or static; and can be used for the third person pronoun, accusative case, passive voice, past tense, imperative statements, and to denote nouns.
> 
> There are also 9 derived letters.
>  - OO makes B: act
>  - OI makes Q: change
>  - ON makes A: capable
>  - IO makes P: know
>  - II makes U: communicate
>  - IN makes L: opine
>  - NO makes R: make
>  - NI makes J: sense
>  - NN makes M: have
> 
> In compound words, the first letter provides the general concept, and subsequent letters refine it. Words can also be defined recursively this way, by using a dash ([group1]-[group2]) to construct new concepts. If the last letter is N, I, or O, it generally denotes that the word is a noun, descriptor, or verb, respectively.

> Based on the information provided, here are some examples of how to create words in your new language:
> 
> 1. OON: A noun denoting the concept of having definite and active action (act-have).
> 2. IIO: A verb that means to observe or depend on communication (communicate-observe).
> 3. INN: A noun meaning to express opinions in a dependent or observable manner (opine-have).
> 4. OOQ: A verb for actively changing or transforming (act-change).
> 5. ONL-OI: A phrase representing the concept of being capable of having opinions (capable-opine) that is related to change (change).
> 
> Now let's answer your questions related to this language:
> 
> 1. How can I make words that represent emotions like love, hate, and happiness?
> You can use the existing letters and derived letters to create new combinations that represent emotions. For example:
>   - Love: PUN (know-communicate-have): To know and communicate positive feelings.
>   - Hate: PUM (know-communicate-make): To know and communicate negative feelings.
>   - Happiness: POA (observe-capable): To observe the capability of being content or joyful.
> 
> 2. How can I create words for different grammatical functions, like conjunctions and prepositions?
> You can create conjunctions and prepositions using the existing letters, derived letters, and your dash system to combine meanings. For example:
>   - And (conjunction): JON (sense-capable): Sensing capability to connect ideas.
>   - But (conjunction): JOM (sense-have): Sensing a shift or contrast in ideas.
>   - In (preposition): LUI (opine-communicate): Expressing the idea of being inside or within something.
>   - On (preposition): LUA (opine-capable): Expressing the idea of being upon or on top of something.
> 
> 3. Can you provide examples of simple sentences using this language?
> Sure! Here are some simple sentences using the words and grammar rules described:
> 
>   - IIO OON: Observe the action (You observe the action happening).
>   - ONN IIO: Capable of being observed (It can be observed).
>   - OOQ INN: Actively change opinions (I change opinions actively).
> 
> Remember that these examples are based on the information you provided and might not perfectly capture your intended meanings. However, they illustrate how to create words and simple sentences using your language's rules.
