> I am filling out a section of the "Statement of Project Objectives" (SOPO) document required for a grant proposal to DOE. The project is "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)". My additions relate to the community benefits plan (CBP). Here is the concept note for the CBP:
> 
> ---
> The EMPOWER Community Benefits Plan focuses effort on two primary audiences: the offshore wind workforce and the coastal stakeholder communities. EMPOWER will engage these audiences by (1) integrating diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and accessibility; (2) contributing to energy equity and environmental justice; and (3) investing in America’s workforce.  
> 
> # Welcoming and Inclusive Environment 
> 
> EMPOWER will develop and implement equitable opportunities with clear decision-making procedures and a code of conduct. Our primary goal is to create a safe and supportive environment that fosters equitable opportunities for every team member in project activities. With a strong emphasis on open communication, we are committed to promoting the exchange of diverse perspectives and ideas. Scholarship and Mentorship: EMPOWER will develop and implement fellowship, scholarship and mentorship programs to promote equity in access and opportunities in offshore wind. The programs will leverage existing partnerships and activities among our partners, build new ones where there are gaps and will engage underserved communities to provide training and educational opportunities in offshore wind research and workforce training. We will direct our recruitment efforts to venues such as the SACNAS conference and engage community college networks, HBCUs, and Tribal Colleges, along with Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Industries (WRISE). Public Information Session and Community Advisory Board: The Consortium will engage and collaborate with coastal communities who are stakeholders in or directly affected by offshore wind projects by establishing relationships to address community concerns. Centered on the principle of co-creation and co-design, it will ensure community perspectives and priorities are integrated into EMPOWER decision-making by conducting public information sessions and forming a diverse community advisory board. Local residents, businesses, environmental organizations, and Tribal Nations will be engaged regularly to identify and prioritize community benefits that can be derived from the activities of the consortium. The community advisory board will meet at least two times a year to provide input, feedback, and recommendations and board members will be paid an honorarium consistent with best practices.   
> 
> The Mid-Atlantic region has a resident workforce with many of the skills needed to attract offshore wind manufacturers and developers. However, the scale and offshore location of the technology will require some workers to have industry-specific training. EMPOWER can help address this challenge by coordinating directly with the local workforce via the municipal economic development agencies and each state's higher education, technical and community colleges, workforce experts, industry experts, and other state agencies to expand activities such as vocational and union training, training facilities, certification programs, experiential learning opportunities, and curriculum development.
> 
> # Energy Equity 
> 
> EMPOWER will endeavor to address the disproportionate burdens that may be imposed on environmental justice (EJ) communities from offshore wind energy decisions and policies. We will take actions to address energy injustice and advance the just and fair siting, development, and governance of offshore wind energy systems. Equitable access to offshore wind benefits: EMPOWER will establish partnerships with local businesses and organizations to maximize procurement opportunities and subcontracting for minority-owned, women-owned, and disadvantaged enterprises, consistent with the philosophy of Justice40. The workforce training program will prioritize individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds or communities. Environmental justice and mitigation: EMPOWER will conduct environmental impact studies to identify any environmental justice concerns that our projects or those of our collaborating partners may create and develop mitigation plans accordingly. EMPOWER will draw together the expertise needed to effectively address environmental justice concerns in OSW energy siting, development, and governance. Building on our Public Information Sessions, we will initiate a public comment process, synthesizing an ongoing stream of comments to inform our stakeholders and our work. Educational outreach: We will empower individuals and communities to participate in offshore wind energy by increasing awareness, understanding, and participation of minority communities. Educational materials, workshops, and online resources will be developed to explain the benefits and impacts of offshore wind energy in accessible and culturally sensitive styles. Community fairs, renewable energy tours, and information sessions will be organized in collaboration with public schools, colleges, and community organizations to integrate offshore wind topics into educational curricula and career programs.

> # Invest in America’s Workforce 
> 
> Investing in America’s workforce is crucial for economic growth, competitiveness, and energy independence. By training American workers with offshore wind energy skills, the United States will be positioned as a global leader in offshore wind energy. EMPOWER will work to maximize the economic benefits of offshore wind energy by cultivating America’s existing and future workforce. In 2022, the Responsible Offshore Wind Alliance (RODA) prepared a research action plan that outlined the OSW concerns of the fishing industry. As it pertains to the existing American workforce, RODA identified that offshore wind energy might be seen as a benefit to fishermen as they diversify their work by assisting with offshore wind projects, however there might also be a loss or displacement of employment as experienced crew and their respective support services shift to offshore wind energy operations. EMPOWER will engage these communities to identify opportunities to sustain this important coastal workforce as offshore wind develops in the U.S. American Supply Chain: EMPOWER will play a supportive role through research and workforce training to encourage the localization of the supply chain and thus promote the growth of American businesses and reduce reliance on imports from abroad. In the offshore wind events that the consortium will organize, partnerships between offshore wind developers and the American supply chain will be facilitated to enhance the participation of American small and medium-sized companies in the supply chain. Skilled American Workforce: The workforce development and training programs will focus on upskilling/reskilling American workers for the specific needs of the offshore wind industry. During our 6-month design phase, we will use skill mappings and economic modeling to identify jobs lost and gained across the Mid-Atlantic, considering both the justice implications of these changes and re-skilling needs that allow us to inform the AWE programs. During the implementation period, we will integrate the comprehensive K12 educational programing at partner institutions like the Blue Heron Bowl and Kid Wind hosted by ECU CSI since 2015 and 2013 respectively, that focus on engaging students from underserved regional communities. The New Jersey Offshore Wind Bootcamp Training program at NJIT can effectively and efficiently provide initial training for engineers to make transition from traditional power trades to the offshore wind industry while the OSW Skills Academy and the Wind Power Graduate Certificate at UD can help train the professional workforce. American Research and Development: EMPOWER will partner with strong existing partnerships with the U.S. National Laboratories that already include joint faculty appointments and American companies to leverage American expertise and resources to nurture talents that can accelerate the development and deployment of cutting-edge offshore wind solutions for America. The knowledge developed by EMPOWER will be shared with the American OSW industry to enhance technical capabilities and elevate America’s leadership in offshore wind. EMPOWER will devise metrics to measure and track its performance, and at least once a year, reflect on and assess weaknesses, progress, and opportunities.

> ---
> Budget Period 1:  
> 
> Objective: In this period, we aim to operationalize the Community Benefit Plan (CBP) by establishing procedures, governing protocols, and a code of conduct that support a welcoming and inclusive environment across all EMPOWER activities. We will identify and engage specific communities falling within our main groups of interest: underprivileged communities in need of support for transitioning to the renewable energy workforce and communities highly dependent on the ocean economy or offshore wind. Through targeted outreach efforts, such as collaborating with community organizations and local partners, we will identify and include these communities in our training and educational programs. Key activities will include forming partnerships with industry experts, community colleges, HBCUs, Tribal Colleges, Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Industries (WRISE), and leveraging our existing networks to provide training and educational opportunities. Additionally, we will establish relationships, public information sessions, and a diverse Community Advisory Board where community perspectives and priorities are integrated into EMPOWER’s decision-making process. 
> 
> Budget Period 2:  
> 
> Objective: In this period, we will (1) Mobilize and enhance our programs designed to cultivate a skilled and diverse workforce ready for offshore wind opportunities; (2) Foster strong, collaborative relationships with communities and establish a two-way communication channel to capture feedback and continuously refine our community engagement approach; (3) Conduct comprehensive environmental impact studies to ensure the sustainable and equitable development of offshore wind projects, addressing any potential environmental justice concerns; (4) Introduce robust performance measures to assess the effectiveness of our CBP, allowing us to track progress, identify areas of opportunity, and adjust strategies accordingly. Through our ongoing engagement and information-sharing initiatives, we aim to keep a wide range of wind energy stakeholders informed, engaged, and involved. Our advances in sustainable energy will serve as concurrent advances in building sustainable and inclusive communities, with the ultimate goal of fostering a just and equitable transition to a renewable future.

> Can you please provide text for the Tasks To Be Performed section,
> consistent with the concept note? Do not divide the text between
> budget period 1 and 2, but do identify outcomes for each.
> 
> Here is additional guidance from DOE:
> 
> The section should describe the specific activities to be conducted over the life of the project.  This section provides a summary of the planned approach to this project and should clearly articulate what work must be accomplished to execute the project scope and thus meet the established project objectives.    
> 
> The task descriptions should be structured with a hierarchy of performance period separated by at least one project-wide go/no-go decision point at the end of each budget period, approximately every 12 to 18 months of the project. In other words, tasks should be organized in a logical sequence and should be divided into the budget periods of the project, as appropriate.     
> 
> Each task and/or subtask is to have a unique number and title and an indication of the approximate duration of the task or subtask in months. Each task and/or subtask is to have a task summary that describes the objectives, what work is to be accomplished, and relationship to project deliverables or expected results.  Appropriate milestones and go/no-go decision criteria should be incorporated into the task and subtask structure. 
> 
> Milestones:  The SOPO should identify appropriate milestones throughout the project to demonstrate success.  A milestone may be either a progress measure (which can be activity based) or a SMART technical milestone.  SMART technical milestones should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely, and must demonstrate a technical achievement rather than simply completing a task. Unless otherwise specified in the FOA, the minimum requirement is that each project must have at least one milestone per quarter for the duration of the project with at least one SMART technical milestone per year (depending on the project, more milestones may be necessary to comprehensively demonstrate progress).  The Applicant should also provide the means by which the milestone will be verified.  In addition to describing milestones in the SOPO text, the milestones should be included in the Milestone Summary Table below.     
> 
> Go/No-Go Decision Points:  The SOPO should include project-wide go/no-go decision points at the end of each budget period.  A go/no-go decision point is a risk management tool and a project management best practice to ensure that, for the current budget period or period of performance, technical success is definitively achieved and potential for success in future budget periods or periods of performance is evaluated, prior to actually beginning the execution of future budget periods.  Unless otherwise specified in the FOA, the minimum requirement is that each project must have at least one project-wide go/no-go decision point for each budget period (approximately each 12 to 18 month period) of the project.  The SOPO should also include the specific technical criteria that will be used to evaluate the progress and make the go/no-go decision.  In addition to describing the go/no-go decision points in the SOPO text, the go/no-go decision points and their method of verification should be included in the Milestone Summary Table below.  Go/no‐go decision points are considered “SMART” and can fulfill the requirement for an annual SMART milestone. 
> 
> End of Project Goal:  The SOPO should include one SMART end of project goal.  The Applicant should also provide the means by which the goal will be verified.  In addition to describing the end of project goal in the SOPO text, the end of project goal should be included in the Milestone Summary Table below.

> Below is an example of a typical task structure. While the example illustrates two Budget Periods and three tasks, the specific project work scope will dictate the appropriate number of budget periods, tasks and subtasks: 
> 
> Budget Period 1 ​[Enter Title]​ – Budget Period designations may not be necessary for all awards but are required for multi-year projects when subsequent work authorization is dependent on meeting success or acceptance criteria associated with major milestones or go/no-go decision points. Text describing the milestone or go/no-go decision is to be inserted into the task structure at the point where prior completed work is expected to confirm attainment of the milestone or support the criteria established to make the go/no-go decision.
