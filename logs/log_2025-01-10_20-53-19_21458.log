**assistant**:
> Yes, the Andromeda galaxy is indeed on a collision course with the Milky Way. Based on current astronomical models and observations, it is expected to collide with the Milky Way in about 4.5 billion years. This event will be quite spectacular, but it is not something we or even many future generations need to worry about. The collision is likely to result in the merging of the two galaxies, forming a new galaxy sometimes referred to as "Milkomeda" or "Milkdromeda".

> Interestingly, despite the enormity of this event, individual stars are unlikely to collide due to the vast distances between them, so our solar system might survive the interaction relatively unscathed. However, the gravitational forces will change the shape and structure of both galaxies significantly.
