**assistant**:
> Yes, all of the rivers you mentioned, including their tributaries, are located on the same continent, which is Asia. The Volga River is the largest river in Europe and flows through Russia, while the other rivers you mentioned, such as the Vyatka, Kama, Oka, and Ural, are also located in Russia and are part of the European part of the country. However, the Ural River also serves as the boundary between Europe and Asia, with its western side in Europe and its eastern side in Asia.
