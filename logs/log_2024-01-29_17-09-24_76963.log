> Do Global Gridded Climate Models have a projection coordinate system?
**assistant**:
> Global Gridded Climate Models (GCMs) do not typically have a projection coordinate system, as they are usually modelled on a global spherical coordinate system. The two key components of this system in GCMs are latitude and longitude, which criss-cross our globe on a grid (i.e. gridded information). 
> 
> When GCM data is represented or mapped for visualization, that's when it might be converted into a map projection like the WGS84 or UTM for practical display and analysis. Often geographic data, when displayed on a 2D map, will have to be projected, but the original GCM data itself adheres to these spherical coordinates on a globe rather than a 2D map.
**user**:
> So, if data is latitude/longitude, does it not need a coordinate projection system?
**assistant**:
> When data is referenced using latitude and longitude, it does not necessarily require a coordinate projection system. Latitude and longitude are inherently spherical coordinates that specify a location on the Earth's surface in terms of angular measurements. They define positions based on the Earth's curved surface rather than a 2D map projection.
> 
> Using latitude and longitude, you can precisely locate any point on Earth. However, when we want to visualize or analyze data on a flat 2D map, we often need to convert those spherical coordinates into a map projection. That's where coordinate projection systems come into play.
> 
> Coordinate projection systems transform the spherical coordinates of latitude and longitude into Cartesian (x, y) coordinates on a 2D map, such as the Mercator, Robinson, or Lambert conformal conic projections. These map projections enable us to represent our spherical Earth on a 2D surface, taking into account distortions that may occur due to the process of flattening the curved surface.
> 
> So, while the original data in latitude/longitude doesn't require a projection system, it may be necessary to apply a projection when visualizing or analyzing the data on a 2D map.
