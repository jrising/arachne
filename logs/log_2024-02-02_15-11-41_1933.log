> Subject: Update on Ph.D. Application and Funding
> 
> Dear Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki,
> 
> I hope this email finds you well.
> 
> Thank you for your continued interest in our Environmental Economics Ph.D. program and for reaching out regarding the status of your application. I appreciate your patience and enthusiasm regarding this process.
> 
> I have been informed that the first round of funding offers has been sent out. Regrettably, your application was not included in this first round. Please note that this does not reflect the quality of your application or your potential for future funding opportunities.
> 
> The allocation of funding is a multifaceted process involving various aspects, including existing funding constraints and the matching of students to faculty research areas. It's important to clarify that the initial funding decisions are often not the final outcome. There is a possibility you could be considered for funding in future rounds, and I urge you to remain hopeful.
> 
> I understand this process can be stressful, and I am here to support you in any way I can. If you would like to discuss this further or if you have any additional questions, I invite you to schedule a meeting with me at [your available times](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0). 
> 
> Thank you for your understanding and for considering our program for your doctoral studies. We appreciate your commitment to your academic journey.
