> I am preparing my external dossier for tenure review, and I would like edits to improve the text as well as the identification of any gaps. I will provide the sections of this one-at-a-time. This is the Research Statement.
> 
> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."
> 
> Second, here is a peer's statement for comparison:
> ---
> My interdisciplinary research program, seeks to understand the effects of climate change on human welfare, including processes of adjustment and adaptation as well as quantifying aggregate costs. I work across environmental and agricultural economics and climate science, publishing and presenting my work in both communities. I use a range of tools encompassing theoretical and computational modeling and econometric methods.
> Quantifying the Aggregate Costs of Climate Change:
> An overarching goal of my work has been to improve the theoretical and scientific basis of our understanding of the magnitude of climate change costs, something essential for the analysis of climate change policy, particularly estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) . My work is unusual in combining both statistical methods and computational modeling of the coupled climate-economic system. Much of this is aimed at improving the “damage function” in these models – something that requires bridging climate science (what are the biophysical effects of greenhouse gas emissions?) and economics (what are the economic consequences of those changes?). I have written two review articles on this topic, one on modeling climate change damages in integrated assessment models, published in Nature Climate Change (1) and one on the reduced-form econometric methods used to identify climate change effects, published in the Review of Environmental Economics and Policy (2). 
> A number of my research papers develop new damage functions for the agricultural sector (3–5). Agricultural damages in models currently used to perform cost-benefit analysis of climate policy are based on climate impacts literature from the 1980s-1990s. My research showed that using the (very extensive) recent scientific literature on the effect of warming and CO2 on crop yields more than doubles the SCC and that accounting for price changes and agricultural trade is important in understanding the regional distribution of impacts. I worked with collaborators to extend this framework to examine the effect of heat stress on agricultural workers (6). The vast majority of agricultural impact estimates consider only land productivity (i.e. yields) but we estimate this misses up to 40% of damages that accrue through lost labor productivity.
> A second line of work in this area, funded through my NSF Coupled-Natural Human Systems grant, is improving the theoretical and empirical understanding of the ecological costs of climate change. These ecological changes are some of the most widespread and long-term effects of climate change. But because the impacts of these changes fall outside the traditional means by which costs are calculated (using markets) they pose particular challenges for economic assessment. This project will address both the theoretical and empirical aspects of this problem. 
> Initial theoretical work, led by my PhD student and advised by myself, modified the well-known DICE model (originally developed by Bill Nordhaus) to explicitly incorporate the particular, imperfectly substitutable role of natural capital in economic production and utility (7). If climate change alters the stock of natural capital then this has long-lived implications for human welfare both through effects on consumption (via production) and on non-use values such as existence and bequest values. Aggregate damages are much larger than in the classic DICE model and optimal mitigation policy involves rapid, near-term cuts in emissions. This stands in stark contrast to the gradual reduction in emissions resulting from the classic DICE model, highlighting the importance of considering these costs.
> I have led a second, empirical paper on this project, currently in revision, that begins bounding the costs of increased extinction risk using data on spending under the US Endangered Species Act, coupled with results from the ecological literature on the fraction of species threatened with extinction (8). I am in the process of mentoring my PhD student in developing a regional version of the natural-capital integrated assessment model which will reflect the differing degrees to which rich vs poor nations rely on natural capital for economic production and the heterogeneous distribution of climate change costs and am also working on an invited paper for the Annual Review on Resource Economics on the topic of natural capital and climate change, which will further develop these ideas. 
>  I have contributed to the computational model infrastructure supporting the cost-benefit integrated assessment models that calculate the social cost of carbon. With James Rising, I co-ordinated a team of graduate students to code the PAGE09 model, developed by Chris Hope and previously available only Excel, in the modeling framework developed by David Anthoff in Julia (9)..
> Learning, Adjustment and Adaptation to Environmental Change:
> A distinct, but related, strand of my research uses statistical methods to understand how people learn about and adjust to climate change. A starting point for this work is the observation that much adaptation is a private good in that its benefits are captured by those investing in it. In principle therefore we might expect substantial adaptation to occur without government intervention. But real-world adaptation and adjustment will be constrained by a number of factors, including cognitive limitations, institutional setting, and capital and technological constraints in ways that are still not well understood. 
> Two of my papers develop the theory and empirics of cognitive limitations in climate change perception and adaptation. First I developed a model of individual learning about climate (the distribution of weather) given only observation of weather (a random draw from the climate distribution), comparing both an optimal Bayesian learning model with simpler updating heuristics (10). I then used social-media data to empirically constrain this updating process, using discussion of weather on Twitter to constrain how expectations of weather change over time (11). Our findings suggest that unusual weather is normalized on approximately a 5-10 year time-frame, but we find no evidence of adaptation over this period: unusually hot and cold temperatures continue to evoke more negative sentiment. This suggests a process of normalizing adverse conditions over a relatively short time-frame without adapting to the negative effects. I have continued to pioneer the use of social-media data as an environmental monitoring tool, showing how it can be used to complement more traditional environmental monitoring data as a way of measuring urban flooding (12).
> A focus of my adaptation work has been the agricultural sector. Agriculture is an interesting and important case because it is heavily exposed to climate change impacts and most adaptations are private goods, where we would expect relatively efficient adaptation if technologically possible. I designed the statistical tests used in Sloat et al. (13), which demonstrated that shifts in the rainfed growing areas of major crops since 1973 has had an adaptive effect, in some cases partially or fully offsetting the exposure to extreme heat associated with anthropogenic warming over this time period. 
> A series of papers focused on Californian agriculture, however, points to the importance of understanding local conditions and institutional constraints because they structure adaptation opportunities in agriculture. I mentored a student-led paper that used the introduction of large-scale groundwater banking projects in Kern County to show the importance of storage in managing variability in irrigation water supply, particularly for high-value but long-term investments such as perennial crops (14). Using data on all water rights holders in California, my PhD student led a paper that estimates the cost of irrigation water curtailments resulting from climate change in California’s Central Valley, under both the state’s current allocation system, based on seniority, and a market mechanism (15). Because of a mismatch between the value of agricultural production and seniority, market-based allocations can create Pareto improvements, cutting the total cost of drought by allocating water to higher-value uses.

In another paper, I bring together multiple methods (econometrics, machine learning, and epidemiological modeling) to improve our understanding of the effects of weather variation on COVID-19 spread\cite{rising2023weather}. As with my work on coffee, structural modeling reveals a hidden impact of weather, in this case on disease detection.

With a new comprehensive description of inter-basin transfers \cite{siddik2023interbasin} (funded by USGS) and state-level water use dataset \cite{josset2019us}, this model has the potential to inform resource conflicts, environmental footprints, and management approaches across the US \cite{brelsford2020developing}.

> Moving forward, I plan to integrate these projects, as building blocks to develop a global, long-term understanding of the future of food. The foundation of this work will be an innovative integration of annual and perennial crop biophysical models with empirical approaches. Such an integration capitalizes on the strengths of both approaches, accounting for non-linearity and adaptation options within the biophysical models while better accounting for the observed heterogeneity in historical productivity.  This would then feed into a model of spatial shifts, which-- in the same spirit of combining methods-- would integrate spatial optimization with statistically-grounded movement and friction models. I have submitted this as a CAREER grant proposal, highlighting the potential for this work to spin-off interactive tools that can support both education and stakeholder/policy-maker engagement.
