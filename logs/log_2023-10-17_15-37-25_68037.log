**user**:
> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. This is for a section on scientific observation. I have two maps in this section. Figure A is on “Ocean Observing Sites”:
> “These data show the location of ocean observing assets within U.S. waters, and the physical parameters generally collected at each platform or gauge.”
> 
> Figure B is a heat map of the annual effort to sight marine mammals and sea turtles:
> The sighting covers cetacean species (Fin whale, humpback whale, minke whale, northern Atlantic right whale, sperm whale, sei whale, Atlantic white- sided dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, harbor porpoise, and Atlantic striped dolphin) and turtles (Green sea turtle, leatherback turtle, and loggerhead turtle).
> 
> Data Source(s): U.S. Navy Marine Resource Assessment (MRA) for the Northeast and Virginia Capes 
> 
> Important areas for marine mammals and sea turtles were determined from point sightings data covering 1979 - 2007. Data were assessed, combined and converted from seasonal species sightings into ten minute squares. 
> 
> Below is the paragraph that is currently in the report, which only covers figure A.
> 
> Can you extend this information to include figure B?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, James. Here's how we might expand the paragraph to include reference to Figure B. 
> 
> "In addition to the wealth of data collected from the various ocean observing sites shown in Figure A, our understanding of the region's marine biodiversity is further enhanced by annual sighting efforts of marine mammals and sea turtles. Figure B presents a heat map detailing these efforts. This map covers sightings of numerous cetacean species, including but not limited to Fin whales, Northern Atlantic right whales, and several dolphin species, as well as sighting of various turtle species such as the Green sea turtle and the Leatherback turtle. 
> 
> Derived from the U.S. Navy Marine Resource Assessment for the Northeast and Virginia Capes, this dataset spans nearly three decades (1979 to 2007). Sighting data were assessed and processed into ten-minute squares for a detailed spatial representation. These sightings serve as a guide to important areas for these marine species. Combined, Figures A and B provide a comprehensive overview of the current and potential activities within Delaware marine waters, emphasizing the complex interplay of physical observation and biological relevance."
