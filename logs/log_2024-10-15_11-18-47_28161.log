> Oceans play a crucial role in sustaining biodiversity, regulating the earth’s climate, providing food security, and supporting livelihoods across a multitude of economic activities (Duarte et al., 2020; Whitmee et al., 2015). Economic activity associated with the oceans is  projected to double between 2010 and 2030 to US$3 trillion as ocean-based industries continue to expand (The Ocean Economy in 2030 | En | OECD, n.d.).  
> 
> At the same time, ocean-based industries  have triggered significant environmental degradation, and contributed to overfishing, habitat destruction, marine pollution, biodiversity loss, and unregulated coastal development ((Dulvy et al., 2003; Lotze et al., 2006; Pandolfi et al., 2003; Worm et al., 2005; Halpern et al., 2008; Human Health and Ocean Pollution - Annals of Global Health, n.d.). For example, oceanic biotic exploitation is reducing the abundance of many aquatic species and harming the health and adaptability of entire marine ecosystems (Ortuño Crespo & Dunn, 2017); marine fish stocks and ecosystems are declining in many regions (Sumaila & Tai, 2020); and increased marine tourism is driving negative impacts on coastal and marine environments, with additional consequences for  tourism-dependent communities (Tourism Is Damaging the Ocean. Here’s What We Can Do to Protect It, 2019). The cumulative effects of these pressures threaten the long-term health of oceans and their capacity to provide ecosystem services essential for human well-being (Lotze et al., 2006; Pandolfi et al., 2003).

> To address the growing conflicts between economic development and environmental sustainability, Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has emerged as a key tool for ecosystem-based management (Crowder & Norse, 2008; Ehler & Douvere, 2009; Reimer et al., 2023). MSP can regulate existing and emerging ocean activities, can reduce conflicts between activities, and can support the introduction of better management strategies (Iglesias-Campos et al., 2021) to achieve ecological, economic, and social objectives in marine spaces. (Ehler & Douvere, 2009).

> Effective MSP relies heavily on the availability and abundance of data (Stamoulis & Delevaux, 2015). For a sustainable and effective MSP process, multiple types of data are needed: regulatory and management data identifying jurisdictional boundaries and policies, biophysical and ecological data describing marine habitats, species and physical oceanography (Ehler & Douvere, 2009), socio-economic data covering fisheries, shipping, navigation, tourism and recreation (Crowder & Norse, 2008), and cultural and heritage data (Gilliland & Laffoley, 2008), environmental impact and vulnerability data on pollution sources and degraded ecosystems (Douvere, 2008), and ecosystem service data for functions like  water purification, coastal protection, and recreational values (Liquete et al., 2013). However, data gaps have hindered MSP’s capacity to fully integrate ecological, economic, and social dimensions (Halpern et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2013). These data gaps include inadequate information (Thurstan et al., 2015), limited spatial resolution (often greater than 10 km, making it difficult to assess fine-scale ecological processes or site specific human activities) (Halpern et al., 2008), temporal gaps and a shortage of real-time (Douvere, 2008), and fragmented data sources (Flynn et al., 2021),. For instance, biological data gaps such as inadequate information on species population dynamics, critical habitats, and migration routes create uncertainty when determining conservation priorities and mitigating the impact of industrial activities (Thurstan et al., 2015). Similarly, socio-economic data gaps concerning the valuation of ecosystem services, the economic contribution of marine industries, and community reliance on marine resources often result in an incomplete understanding of the economic trade-off involved in MSP (Stithou, 2017). Supporting this, Flannery et al., 2016 highlight that inadequate attention to the collection and incorporation of social and ecological data has led to criticism for several MSP processes (Fock, 2008). This data gap can lead to an incomplete representation of crucial marine activities and areas, negatively impacting the planning process (Thoya et al., 2021). Analyzing existing data sources to identify any gaps and gathering stakeholder perspectives through interviews are considered two of the key steps in MSP (Shucksmith et al., 2014; Thoya et al., 2021).

> Here we develop  a comprehensive catalog of spatially-resolved marine data for Delaware, to understand the extent of data gaps. Multiple forms of data gaps are relevant to the MSP process. We construct a categorization scheme that (1) highlights the need for both human and resource information and (2) recognizes that some forms of data importantly build upon others.

> Methods 
> 
> In our study we consider resources, habitats, activities, and constraints that occur within Delaware Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Control’s (DNREC) Planning Area, shown in Figure 1, as well as activities in Delaware closely associated with the marine waters. The eastern edge of the planning area is set at 72° 24" W, covering the marine caverns offshore Delaware.

> We define an “activity” as a way that a spatial segment of the ocean or bay is used, managed, or interacted with. This includes everything from shipping, where the ocean acts as little more than a roadway, to the presence of artificial reefs, encompassing both their construction and the consequences they have on the local ecosystem. We also include activities which could be supported by future marine spatial planning, even if they do not currently occur in Delaware waters.

> To identify relevant activities related to the bay and ocean in Delaware, we used a systematic and comprehensive approach. To begin, we looked at publicly available datasets such as the Marine Cadastre, the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal (MARCO), ship use designations from Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracks in 2022, and various tourism data sources to get a baseline understanding of marine and coastal usage. Second, we drew upon economic classifications of marine-related industry, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) categories in "Exhibit 2. Ocean Economy Sectors and Industries by SIC and NAICS Codes," and the University of Massachusetts President's Office report titled An Assessment of the Coastal and Marine Economies of Massachusetts, dated June 29, 2006. Third, we conducted an extensive review of academic literature, reviewing papers on Marine Spatial Planning in the mid-Atlantic region. Finally, we drew upon notes from stakeholders meetings conducted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). These meetings gave us direct insights and helped us identify additional activities not covered in the literature review.

> We also performed a survey of individual and organizational use of the Delaware Bay and ocean and associated data needs. This survey was sent to respondents in academic, business, federal and local government, and NGOs. Responses representing a wide range of interests: recreation and tourism, commercial fishing, port and harbor operations, research and environmental studies, and educational programs. The respondents also identified different regions of particular interest, including coasts, tidal marshes, near shore waters, and deeper federal waters.

> For each marine activity identified, we evaluated the presence of six categories of data as follows. i) Physical data, covering features of the natural environment and the physical prerequisites for the activity. This includes physical properties of the ocean, such as bathymetry, ocean chemistry, and marine climatology, and the biological conditions that create suitable habitats, such as substrate, climatological suitability, and spawning grounds. However, the resources themselves which are exploited or modified by the activity are not part of this category; ii) Resource data, describing the material that the activity utilizes, extracts, or modifies. It ranges from observed abundance of fish and sand resources to wind speeds at the turbine level; iii) Usage data, including how the resources and physical environment are utilized. It covers the extent of the exploitation, such as catch data for fish, or visitation, such as tourists trips. iv) Management data, covering how the usage of the resource is managed. It can involve regional zone designations, and spatial or quantitative data related to regulatory policies and management bodies; v) Economic data, covering the financial and economic outcomes of the usage of the resource under current management. It includes revenue, cost, employment numbers, and data on outputs produced; and vi) Future/Proposed data,  including projected changes to the physical environment, resources, or uses; as well as proposed changes in management or infrastructure.  Datasets were identified across government providers, NGOs, central data repositories, and academic articles.  Datasets are also flagged as being legacy data (greater than 10 years old) or low-resolution (greater than 10 km resolution). In some cases, the same datasets are relevant to a wide range of activities. For this, we have identified “Dataset Collections”, such as seven bathymetry datasets, which are then referenced as relevant datasets under the relevant activities. Figure 2: Summary of data-gaps analysis approach. (a) “Specific activities” that are broadly related are combined into “activity groups” for the purpose of reporting. Each specific activity is linked to all relevant datasets, according to one or more “dataset relevance” categories. (b) The spatial scale, temporal range, and update frequency of datasets is identified to quantify the quality of data over time. This is shown here for all datasets, by relevance category, and split by activity group in the results below. (c) The number of activities linked with each dataset, colored by that dataset’s relevance.

> Results

> The table below provides a summary of the number of datasets identified across each of the studied activities, for each category of data relevance. In the table, physical, resource, and usage data is split between a count of all datasets (“All”) and high-quality data sets (“H.Q.”). High quality datasets are those that are more recent than 10 years old and have spatial resolutions greater than a 10 km grid. Across all combinations of activities and data categories, there are 460 connections. However, this number double counts datasets that inform multiple activities or data categories. This report is based on the recording of 299 datasets, of which 113 were evaluated beyond just their association with activities and data categories (the remaining come from the MARCO Data Catalog or Earth Engine Catalog). Each activity will also show some spatial and temporal information about its available datasets, in a Available Data Figure. Only datasets where temporal and spatial information has been recorded will show up in these figures.

> As ocean-based industries expand and the economic value of marine resources is set to double by 2030, the imperative for sustainable and effective marine spatial planning (MSP) becomes ever more critical. This paper examines data gaps that hinder the effective integration of ecological, economic, and social dimensions within MSP efforts, focusing on the Delaware coast. Utilizing a comprehensive catalog of spatially-resolved marine data, we assess multiple forms of data gaps pertinent to MSP processes. Our approach categorizes data into physical, resource, usage, management, economic, and future/proposed categories while emphasizing the interdependent nature of these data types. We employ datasets spanning government records, NGOs, central data repositories, and academic articles, accounting for legacy and low-resolution issues. Our findings reveal significant data gaps across the Delaware coast, with 460 connections identified among 299 datasets, though data duplication challenges comprehensive analysis. This research provides a framework for identifying and addressing data deficiencies, facilitating more nuanced and effective MSP processes in Delaware and potentially other marine areas.
