> Doctoral Programme “Climate Change”

> 1. Project description
> 1.1 Research framework
> 1.1.1 Research and overarching research questions in existing doctoral programme
> Human societies and ecosystems face growing, often complex and cascading risks from climate
> change (IPCC, 20231; we understand risks as defined by the IPCC as the interaction of hazard,
> vulnerability and exposure). Even under strong mitigation scenarios, adaptation to these risks will be
> necessary. The University of Graz has long standing experience in research and education about climate risks. In 2015, researchers from five faculties established the doctoral programme Climate Change (DPCC, https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/training-program/doctoral-program/) to
> integrate the PhD education on climate research. From 2015 to 2022, more than 40 PhD students in this programme have been funded by the FWF graduate school “Climate Change - Uncertainties,
> Thresholds and Coping Strategies”. This graduate school conducted research on climate change uncertainties in the natural and social sciences, critical thresholds in environmental, social and
> economic systems, and the development of strategies for a transition towards a low carbon and
> climate-robust economy and society. These topics were addressed not only from a natural and social science perspective, but complemented by normative and legal considerations.
> Since then, the graduate school has built a scientific community that has developed an
> interdisciplinary joint understanding of the problems, provides co-supervision and a shared training
> programme that promotes disciplinary and interdisciplinary academic excellence. The success of the school is demonstrated by a high number of high-quality publications in leading international journals
> (e.g. Science Advances, Geophysical Research Letters, Communications Earth and Environment), and
> several awards such as the Austrian State Prize for the best PhD thesis. Several alumni of the school obtained prestigious postdoc positions (e.g. ETH Zurich, MPI for Biogeochemistry, Princeton), and
> several now work as assistant professors (e.g. at Freiburg University, Erasmus University of Rotterdam, University College Cork, University of Alaska Anchorage).
> While the research within the DPCC initially focussed on climate-society relationships, it is becoming
> more and more evident that both systems are intricately coupled with ecology and biodiversity2. As a
> result, protection of ecosystems and biodiversity may serve as nature-based solutions and hence create
> co-benefits for adaptation. But conversely, adaptation may also result in unforeseen detrimental outcomes for ecosystems and biodiversity. Considering climate, human society and ecosystems as a coupled system is thus key to understanding climate risks and to implement sustainable adaptation
> solutions, yet climate change adaptation and biodiversity are in practice largely addressed in separate domains3. We therefore need both researchers and practitioners knowledgeable of this coupled system, i.e., a novel interdisciplinary doctoral education. Therefore, colleagues from the Institute of Biology have joined DPCC to extend its research and training to the climate - ecology - society (CES)
> 5
> nexus. The following overarching research question has emerged as one focus of research and
> training in the DPCC:
> What are risks from climate and global change for social and ecological systems, and how can we
> evaluate adaptation options according to ethical, economic, feasibility and legitimacy criteria?
> HOT.DOC seeks funding for 10 PhD positions to firmly establish research and training at the CES
> nexus in Graz. It will address this overarching question for risks from heat and drought over the
> European Alps as a showcase example, focussing on worst-case events.
> 1.1.2 State of the art
> With its new taxonomy on sustainable activities and its mission on Adaptation to Climate Change, the
> European Union acknowledges the need for understanding climate risks and adapting to them.
> The highest risks typically arise from very rare and very severe events4,5. Mountain regions are
> particularly vulnerable to climate change6. The European Alps have been coined the water towers of Europe7. But recent heatwaves and droughts, such as in 2003, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2022 have demonstrated the emergence of new risks8–12. But while the rainfall did not show long-term trends10,
> stronger evapotranspiration13 resulted in severe and impactful Alpine droughts in particular over the
> last decade11. Summer precipitation is projected to decrease over the Alps14, causing, along with
> increasing temperatures, more severe soil moisture drought15, and in turn streamflow and groundwater drought16,17. Summer heat is projected to increase, and new evidence suggests that the rarest heat events may respond much stronger to climate change than previously expected18. These changes will be region and elevation dependent19. Snow and glaciers partially mitigate the impacts of heat and
> drought20,21, but are themselves strongly affected by such events6,22. Glacier retreat6,23 and reduced
> snow cover24,25 will change runoff regimes: seasonality will become stronger with a drying in
> summer26,27 and an increasing risk of streamflow drought and reduced water availability20,28. Under a
> warmer climate, recurring drought has been found to severely alter soil-plant interactions such that water flow is restricted to rapidly draining, large pores29.
> According to the IPCC Synthesis Report 20231, climate change has caused substantial losses and
> damages to terrestrial, freshwater and cryospheric ecosystems in mountain regions, has led species to
> move to higher elevations, and some ecosystems have already undergone irreversible change.
> Elevation-dependent warming19 threatens Alpine ecosystems in particular, and some high elevation
> ecosystems could completely disappear30. This entails the risk of losing ecosystem functions such
> as nutrient cycling and soil stabilization by soil biocrusts31 (ground-covering cyanobacteria, often
> associated by mosses and lichens) in high alpine environments. Changes in streamflow drought will likely affect the crucial contributions of streams to aquatic biodiversity and nutrient balances in alpine
> creeks and rivers32–34. Overall, alpine ecosystems are among the most diverse and most endangered
> classes of habitats on Earth35. Climate change interacts with simultaneous pressures from other global change factors (e.g. land use, pollution, invasion) which jointly threaten the biodiversity and stability
> 6
> of ecosystems36, and anthropogenic interventions such as land-use changes may further amplify
> drought37. Heat and drought have already affected ecosystem services, such as extent and suitable
> species composition in alpine grassland38 and grassland yield39. In forest ecosystems a decrease in
> carbon stock, biodiversity and protective functions is expected40–42, specifically the increase of bark
> beetle disturbances due to climate change43. Recent climatic disturbances have challenged the forest sector by causing unpredictable wood flows and reduced wood quality44.
> While knowledge on adaptation to many climate risks in many human systems has increased
> substantially over the last decade45, knowledge on adaptation in alpine areas is still scarce, and most demonstrated actions are incremental and small-scale in nature46. Given the scale of the challenge of climate change, however, many adaptation options may reach their hard or soft limits and therefore
> more transformational actions, such as managed retreat, may be needed47. While nature-based
> solutions have been advocated by some scholars as the solution to the combined climate and
> biodiversity crisis48, many challenges remain to balance synergies and manage trade-offs. The IPBES & IPCC workshop3 highlights potential co-benefits from climate change adaptation and biodiversity
> protection, but also warns of the possible negative effects of adaptation for biodiversity. The report emphasises the need for treating climate, human societies and biodiversity as coupled systems.
> Research in ethics is faced with the challenge of determining how to evaluate climate risks and adaptation measures, taking into account human and non-human interests and biodiversity values49.
> 1.1.3 Research Topics, Questions and Methodologies of HOT.DOC
> Against this background, researching the emerging and complex risks from heat and drought in the
> European Alps at the CES nexus constitutes a timely and highly topical research and education
> programme.
> Research and training within HOT.DOC will be organised into four topics. The first three will each
> center on one element of the nexus (climate, ecology and society), to foster the development of a deep
> understanding of the processes and dynamics within each element. The fourth will be dedicated to
> understanding interactions between and cascading risks across these elements, and to jointly evaluate
> the risks and potential adaptation measures from an economic, ecological and normative perspective.
> Figure 1: Research topics and dissertation projects.
> 7
> The specific hazards, ecosystems and economic sectors considered in HOT.DOC are chosen
> according to the availability of top supervisors at the University of Graz, and to provide a representative cross section of research topics that allow for fruitful interdisciplinary collaboration on
> complex and cascading risks at the CES nexus.
> Topic 1: Climate change and drought hazards in the Alps (DP1-3)
> This topic is about understanding and projecting the hazard of heat and drought events over the
> European Alps across the water cycle, with a focus on worst case events.
> Research Questions: (1) What are heat and drought hazards in present and future climate in the European Alps, ranging from the atmosphere to the cryosphere, to soil and groundwater, and how do worst-case drought events, in particular, respond to global climate change?
> (2) What are the processes causing worst-case events and their climatic changes, including the
> coupling across water cycle components?
> (3) How do landuse and vegetation changes affect the regional manifestation of heat and drought hazards in present and future climate in the European Alps? (with Topics 2-4)
> Dissertation Projects and Methods: DP1 (1) analyses worst-case drought events over the European
> Alps in observations and ensembles of present and future climate model simulations, (2) simulates
> event-storylines of worst-case events (Section 1.1.4), and (3) identifies the meteorological drivers of very extreme heat and drought events over the European Alps. DP2 assesses the role of the
> cryosphere in mitigating drought effects, and the implications of future extreme loss of alpine cryosphere for drought due to lack of glacier and snow melt. DP3 DP3 (1) simulates the propagation
> of drought from the atmosphere to soil water, groundwater, and surface water at the catchment scale,
> (2) analyses how climate change and alterations in soil-plant interactions affect evapotranspiration
> and drought propagation, and (3) identifies impacts of worst-case events on groundwater resources
> and streamflow.
> Topic 2: Ecological risks from heat and drought in the Alps (DP 4-6) In this topic, we select three widely divergent study systems - soil biocrusts, aquatic animals, and
> landscapes - to investigate heat and drought risks to natural systems in alpine and pre-alpine areas.
> Research Questions:
> (1) What are the impacts of heat and drought on soil microbiota, landscape dynamics and stream ecosystems in the Alpine region?
> (2) What are the impacts of management, adaptation and mitigation measures on ecosystems in the
> European Alps?
> (3) How will functions and functionality of ecosystems be impacted by prospected changes of climate
> and land use? Dissertation Projects and Methods: DP4 investigates how alpine soil microbiota forming biological
> 8
> soil crust communities and their ecosystem services are affected by heat and drought, in particular when the patterns of precipitation change. In DP5, the impacts of heat and drought, and in particular including worst-caste events on landscape dynamics, structure and biodiversity in Austria will be
> investigated. By analysing amphipods as keystone species in the food web of river and stream habitats, DP6 addresses the problem of maintaining intraspecific diversity in stream ecosystems
> facing pressure from heat and drought.
> Topic 3: Socio-economic risks from heat and drought in the Alps (DP7-9): This topic is dedicated to investigating the implications for forests, a multi-functional system of high
> relevance both from an economic and societal perspective.
> Research Questions:
> (1) How to interdisciplinary assess the impact of heat and drought, with a focus on worst-case events,
> on important regulating and provisioning ecosystem services provided by alpine forests?
> (2) What are the implications of heat and drought on selected regulating and provisioning services for economy and society?
> (3) How can the risks to these regulating and provisioning services be reduced by different adaptation
> options, including nature-based solutions?
> Dissertation Projects and Methods: The DPs of this topic assess ecosystem services provided by
> alpine forests under present and future climatic conditions; evaluate impacts on different societal actors; and investigate the altering solution space to address risks in alpine forests. Using highresolution remote sensing data, DP7 will investigate the effect of past drought events on structure and
> vitality of spruce monocultures and mixed forests and analyse implications for biodiversity (with
> DP6), protective and provisioning ecosystem services. Complementary, DP8 will apply a system dynamics-based forest sector model to analyse extreme wood supply fluctuations caused by extreme
> short-term climatic stressors (storms, droughts, bark beetles). It will investigate social and economic
> consequences for forest owners and connected value chains. Using a mixed methods approach, DP9
> will investigate the potential loss of protective forest for settlements and livelihoods, and implications
> for state duties towards its residents (protection of life and assets) and potential stress on government budgets. With DP8, DP9 will investigate the feasibility, effectiveness and limits of nature-based
> solutions, as well as of structural, institutional and organisational adaptation options.
> Topic 4: Interconnections, Risk evaluation and synthesis (all):
> This topic is dedicated to (1) modelling and analysing interconnections at the CES-nexus, (2) the
> development and application of a framework for risk evaluation, and (3) an overall synthesis of the
> results.
> Research Questions:
> (1) How do changes in heat and drought in the European Alps interact with changes in ecosystems,
> land-use and forest management, with a focus on worst-case events, and how are the resulting risks
> 9
> for ecosystems and society connected and depend on each other?
> (2) For extreme drought, how can we develop a comprehensive concept of vulnerability and exposure
> that is equally suitable for analysing natural systems and society as well as their interactions and takes
> into account different understandings of both the values at stake and their weight in the evaluation?
> (3) Based on this concept, what are the results of such evaluations for the identified drought risks and
> adaptation options according to ethical, economic, feasibility and legitimacy criteria?
> Dissertation Projects and Methods: DP1-9, led by DP1, will develop a methodological framework to model interactions between the different elements of the CES nexus based on event storylines
> (Section 1.1.4). DP10 will develop the foundations of an evaluative framework (Section 1.1.4) and
> therefore collaborate with DP4-DP9 from the start on. DP10 will investigate in detail how different understandings of how to take into account human and animal interests and the values of biodiversity
> matter for choosing among alternative adaptation measures. In particular, we will investigate the effects of nature-based solutions, both for biodiversity and human livelihoods, looking also into
> potential trade-offs and limits to adaptation.
> 1.1.4 Integrating Concepts and Methods
> Common language and understanding: An important integrating element will be the development of a common language and understanding of key concepts such as drought and risks. While different disciplines may use different concepts (e.g., meteorological, soil moisture and hydrological drought),
> it will be important to understand communalities, differences and connections between these concepts
> (see Section 1.3.1 on how this will be integrated into the training). Workshops and lectures will be
> organized to exchange ideas and to develop a common understanding (e.g. on adaptation and naturebased solutions), if necessary with participation from external experts and stakeholders.
> Event storylines: A key integrating step fostering interdisciplinary collaboration will be to jointly
> develop event storylines of plausible worst-case future heat and drought events and their impacts on
> ecosystems and socio-economic systems. Event storylines are physically self-consistent unfoldings of
> (in our context) plausible future events50–52. DP1 will simulate selected worst-case heat and drought events, conditioned on varying inputs from the other DPs representing a range of possible ecological and socio-economic changes (e.g., vegetation and landuse). The simulated climate storylines in turn
> will serve as the basis for further modelling studies or qualitative assessments and narrative
> descriptions in the other DPs. As such, the storylines integrate across disciplines and allow for an
> assessment of feedbacks and complex and cascading risks at the CES nexus.
> Joint evaluation framework: A multi-dimensional evaluation framework will be developed that combines economic and non-economic values in a normative evaluation, distils information from multiple lines of evidence, and is flexible to account for the availability of new information.
> Interdisciplinary collaboration across scales and regions: While the individual DPs will be
> organised such that their basic results can be achieved independently, collaboration will be fostered by
> 10
> focusing on the Eastern Alps. Most modelling will be conducted across the entire Eastern Alps or beyond and complemented and evaluated by regional scale observational datasets and local case studies (e.g. ClimGrass experimental site, Raumberg-Gumpenstein). Students will team up, complement each other with their expertise and contribute as mutual co-authors to publications
> (Section 1.3.1).
> Integration of other DPCC students: The research specific to HOT.DOC will be accompanied by
> other research in DPCC on climate change, climate risks, and biodiversity. HOT.DOC will also serve
> as a nucleus for further research on the CES nexus. PhD students from relevant other projects can
> become associate members of HOT.DOC and participate in the training programme (Section 1.3).
> 1.1.5 Expected academic advances, innovation and significance
> HOT.DROUGHT will greatly advance our understanding of heat and drought risks for human society
> and ecosystems in the European Alps. The findings will also be relevant for other mountain regions in
> the mid-latitudes. In particular, HOT.DOC will generate crucial knowledge along a representative
> research cross section about the nexus of climate change, human society and biodiversity in the Alps,
> including complex and cascading risks. Key results will be the development of adaptation solutions
> and an overall evaluation of the considered risks, taking into account ethical, economic, feasibility and
> legitimacy considerations.
> HOT.DOC will also create methodological advances. The results will be integrated from multiple
> lines of evidence, including modelling, observations and the analysis of (new and existing) experiments. Integrated storylines of different plausible climatic, socio-economic and ecological evolutions will be developed to generate an interdisciplinary understanding of their complex
> interactions. Thereby, HOT.DOC will contribute to the field of climate information distillation.
> Focusing on selected impact domains will shape the specific climate research and thus create a basis
> for targeted climate services.
> HOT.DOC will be one of the first structured PhD programmes focussing on the CES nexus (and
> collaborate with the excellent research and training in Leipzig, Section 1.5.2). The PhD students will be trained in considering interdependencies, co-benefits, negative impacts, cascading and complex risks for society and ecosystems. HOT.DOC alumni will thus have a holistic understanding of the
> complex interplay of climate change, society and biodiversity. The PhD training will be
> interdisciplinary and address all European Commission’s Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training
> (Section 1.3). HOT.DOC will thus be at the forefront of doctoral training and educating tomorrow’s
> researchers and practitioners.
> 11
> 1.1.6 Existing structures for excellent PhD research
> The research in HOT.DOC is embedded in the Field of Excellence Climate Change Graz (CCG,
> https://climate-change.uni-graz.at/en) which was established in 2019 to join forces across disciplinary
> boundaries to advance our understanding of climate change, its impacts and options to respond, in
> order to develop sustainable solutions for the future. The research team consists of more than 100
> scientists, led by 25 professors as Principal Investigators (PIs). CCG builds on 25 years of interdisciplinary teaching and research, and integrates scientists from the natural and environmental sciences, economics, social sciences and humanities. CCG is tightly integrated into the international scientific community, as demonstrated by three IPCC lead authorships, memberships in steering
> committees and working groups of key international research initiatives (Section 1.2). CCG offers an
> international fellowship programme to attract international researchers for longer research stays.
> Additionally, CCG is collaborating closely with national and international stakeholders. The
> stakeholder work is facilitated by a transacademic interface manager. CCG contributes to teaching in various BSc and MSc programmes across six faculties. The faculty members participating in
> HOT.DOC are all members of CCG, including the speakers (Lukas Meyer and Bettina Weber) and
> co-speakers (Birgit Bednar-Friedl and Douglas Maraun) of CCG.
> All PhD students will be invited to join CCG as associated early-stage researchers. As members of the
> Field of Excellence the PhD students will be able to join all activities and have access to the funding
> opportunities including funding for scientific events, seed funding for new interdisciplinary project ideas, science to public events, short-term incoming research fellowships. They will also have the
> opportunity to present their research in the scientific exchange format of CCG and learn about the
> research of the other members. CCG also offers support for project proposals by a research manager and opportunities to experience stakeholder research by the support of a transdisciplinary interface manager. DPCC is part of the Doctoral Academy, the institutional roof for structured doctoral education at the University of Graz. The HOT.DOC PhD students will have access to all research
> support offered by the Doctoral Academy (Section 1.3).
> 1.1.7 Ethical, Gender and Diversity Aspects of the Research
> For the experiments proposed in the Project we will seek timely approval from the ethics committee at the University of Graz. All necessary permits for plant and biocrust projects have already been
> obtained. Otherwise, as the planned research mostly entails theory-building and analysis of already
> collected data, no other such issues are expected to arise. No personal data will be generated or used within HOT.DOC. The University of Graz offers a comprehensive safety training programme. All
> PhD students will be insured during field work.
> To address gender and intersectionality problems, HOT.DOC will assess the impact of high-risk
> scenarios on most vulnerable social groups, and will research how to increase agency of these groups
> to reduce those risks, e.g., through collective and organised action or changing regulations.
> 12

During his postdoc, he also led several efforts to make commonly applied tools more tractable, including a test of methods for incorporating “higher order interactions” into competition models. His current work focuses on further extending state space methods, to enable

> Here is the section on the existing program:
> ===
> 1.3 Existing education and training program
> The University of Graz endorses the European Commission’s Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training, which were derived from the Salzburg Recommendations for Doctoral Programmes. These principles are (1) research excellence, (2) attractive institutional environment, (3) interdisciplinary
> research options, (4) exposure to relevant employment sectors, (5) international networking, (6) transferable skills training and (7) quality assurance. To implement these principles, the University
> has established the Doctoral Academy Graz as institutional roof for structured doctoral education. The
> PhD students in HOT.DOC will join the Doctoral Programme DPCC (Section 1.1.1) which is part of the Doctoral Academy. By promoting excellent doctoral researchers via structured doctoral education,
> it places the University of Graz at the forefront of current international developments in the field of doctoral studies. The Doctoral Academy also offers a programme and certificate on transferable skills.
> 1.3.1 Program content
> The DPCC serves to integrate doctoral education across the Field of Excellence CCG. While all PhD students have to enrol in a disciplinary PhD curriculum linked to a host faculty, these curricula leave plenty of freedom for targeted education. Here, HOT.DOC will offer the following tailored education
> supporting the needs of its PhD students: (1) Introductory workshop (4 ECTS; 3 days, getting to know each other, lectures to bring the PhD students to an equal level of basic interdisciplinary understanding, discussions to develop a common vision)
> (2) Colloquium (4 ECTS per semester; regular bi-weekly exchange of students and faculty via
> interdisciplinary seminars, presentations of relevant papers and structured discussions)
> (3) Annual workshops (4 ECTS; 2 days, keynote lectures by external and internal speakers; oral presentations by PhD students, discussions). The third annual workshop will be dedicated to planning
> interdisciplinary collaboration on joint publications.
> (4) Summer school (6 ECTS; 1 week, end of the 2nd or beginning of 3rd year; lectures and hands-on
> training by internal and external teachers; open for other PhD students working on similar research)
> (5) Stakeholder workshop (4 ECTS; 2 days; organised by the PhD students to discuss real world
> questions on climate risks with decision makers, build a career network outside academia, and train
> organisational skills)
> Students will receive a certificate for completing these courses. These courses can also be applied to
> fulfil credit requirements of the doctoral curricula of the faculties in which students are enrolled, in
> consultation with the relevant deans of studies and curricula commissions.
> Additionally, students will be encouraged to organise workshops on their research topics or to arrange
> a young scientist conference with invited speakers to establish their own research networks and
> support their career building. The Field of Excellence will provide funding for such events.
> 17
> A key element of the doctoral training will be interdisciplinary collaboration, fostered by
> colloquium and workshops. Additionally, the PhD students will organise informal meetings with
> selected fellow PhD students and faculty members to discuss topics, exchange knowledge, and write
> joint publications. The idea is that one student leads research directly related to their PhD thesis, and seeks input from other students with expertise in relevant other fields (e.g., an ecologist asking for help in interpreting a climatic influence). The students will also be encouraged to integrate their disciplinary literature reviews into a joint interdisciplinary review paper to develop a common
> understanding of the HOT.DOC research topics.
> The students will further be supported to develop their transferable skills. The Doctoral Academy
> offers excellent courses (https://doctoral-academy.uni-graz.at/en/courses/) including, e.g., writing labs, individual coaching, technical skills such as programming or machine learning, teaching skills,
> writing research proposals, good scientific practice, organising successful workshops, legal issues,
> resilience and wellbeing, and how to pursue a career with a family. Uni Graz has established the Career Program for Women Scientists for doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows to support female scientists pursuing a professional career inside and outside academia. Additionally, HOT.DOC will organise events such as courses by editors of high-profile journals, a course on science
> communication and one on stakeholder engagement (held by CCG’s transacademic interface
> manager, a position dedicated to managing stakeholder engagement in the field of climate change).
> International networking will be a key element of the PhD education in HOT.DOC. First, PhD students can earn ECTS points for their curricula by attending external summer schools, international conferences and workshops. Second, all PhD students will be strongly encouraged to hold a 3-6
> month research stay at one of the partnering institutions (see Letters of Intent, Annex 4). These will be funded by HOT.DOC, while the University offers additional mobility funds for young researchers, and the office for International Relations offers further exchange programmes.
> 1.3.2 Selection of doctoral candidates
> The hiring procedure of doctoral candidates aims at recruiting excellent doctoral students in a process
> that is fair, transparent, and inclusive and ensures a diverse team. HOT.DOC will make use of the
> selection procedure successfully applied in the FWF Graduate School “Climate Change -
> Uncertainties, Thresholds and Coping Strategies”.
> The positions for the 10 doctoral students will be advertised internationally as one single call.
> Applicants will be requested to provide a CV, a list of previous publications and two letters of recommendations. To set the basis for an optimal matching between the PhD candidates and the (co-)
> supervisors, the applicants will be asked to include a statement concerning their preferences over the
> planned projects. Following a screening process by subgroups of the faculty (according to the research
> focus of the positions), candidates will be assigned to potential supervisors with respect to their interests and qualifications. The potential supervisors will arrange an online (to reduce the carbon
> 18
> footprint and to ensure equal opportunities) interview, to be held with potential co-supervisors. With
> the help of recruitment experts from the University’s human resources department, they will develop a
> ranked shortlist. The final decision will be made in a faculty meeting, based on submitted documents
> and a report of the interview report and submitted documents. The faculty will also consider how well candidates may integrate into HOT.DOC and whether they contribute to a diverse team.
> The students are intended to start at approximately the same time to allow for a harmonised
> curriculum (such that also the advancements of their PhD work are at a similar level) and to establish
> robust working relationships between the students. A Welcome Center (https://welcome.unigraz.at/en/) and an online admission guide are available to assist potential future students in their admission process (https://welcome.uni-graz.at/en/international-students/prospective-students/).
> We aim at having at least 30 percent female students, but have proven to achieve a higher share in the
> graduate school. In case of equivalent qualifications, preference will therefore be given to female
> applicants. Throughout the recruitment process, applications will be supervised by the institutional working group on equal opportunities. To ensure gender mainstreaming, we aim at a mixed gender representation on all decision-making committees, including the recruitment committees, and the PhD training committees. The doctoral candidates will be employed as “University Assistant without Doctorate”, according to
> the Austrian Labour Law as well as respecting the Austrian “Collective Agreement for Universities”
> and FWF rules for 30 hours per week for carrying out their research duties within this project.
> 1.3.3 Supervision, mentoring, monitoring and conflict resolution
> HOT.DOC will provide intensive supervision and support by the faculty members. All senior PIs have ample experience in PhD supervision, the younger PIs will be supported by senior co-supervisors.
> Supervision: PhD candidates will be supervised by a main supervisor and a co-supervisor from a
> different discipline with a related research focus. Career development plans, including the definition
> of a thesis topic, will be prepared and updated yearly by all PhD students with their supervisors. The
> supervisor is the main person to promote and monitor the progress and to provide primary feedback in
> regular meetings. The specific duties beyond regular meetings comprise discussing and developing
> publications; discussing teaching activities by the student; supporting the student in planning research
> stays; and guiding the student to become part of the international scientific community. The cosupervisor is not necessarily involved in the day-to-day research process, but will meet with the
> student individually to observe and guide the interdisciplinary aspects and perspectives of their projects. Additionally, team supervision by the whole faculty will be ensured by presentations and
> discussions at the colloquium and annual workshops.
> Mentoring: In addition to the supervisors, the PhD students are required to choose a mentor from the
> Field of Excellence CCG who is not participating in HOT.DOC. The mentor will provide independent advice, e.g., on general questions related to the PhD studies and on career options.
> 19
> Monitoring: the progress of the PhD students will be monitored in several ways: by regular meetings
> with the supervisor and formal biannual supervisory meetings with both supervisors; by presentations
> in the colloquium and at the annual workshops; by the submission of progress reports to the dean of studies; by appraisal meetings held annually.
> Conflict resolution: Conflicts between a student and their supervisor will be settled following the
> standard procedures of the University. The mentor selected by the student can be approached
> independently of their supervisor. The mentor will be in charge also to act as a mediator between
> supervisor and student. Upon the mentor’s suggestion, the head of the doctoral school may decide to
> find another supervisor for the student – while the student may be allowed by the faculty meeting to
> remain within the DPCC. Furthermore, the Doctoral Academy Graz has an independent ombudsperson to solve issues that may require help from outside HOT.DOC.
> 1.3.4 Assessment criteria and research integration for a top international doctoral degree
> All PhD students have to earn ECTS points as required by the disciplinary curricula of their corresponding faculty, but formal graduation requirements vary by field and faculty. To ensure
> highest quality standards, the following procedures will be employed. The final assessment comprises
> thesis and defense. The thesis based on peer reviewed articles (either as cumulative dissertation or
> monograph) has to contain original scientific work. A cumulative thesis has to be built upon at least three peer reviewed articles in international scientific journals. The thesis is reviewed by at least two
> examiners (depending on the corresponding faculty), one of them from an international University.
> The public defense consists of an oral presentation and an examination by three examiners, one of them the supervisor, one a reviewer of the thesis.
> The PhD students will be closely integrated into the research conducted within the DPCC and the
> broader Field of Excellence CCG, and will be supported in establishing themselves as members of the
> international scientific community. The core elements of integration will be the programme laid out in
> 1.3.1, in particular the biweekly colloquium, where PhD students and faculty exchange ideas and
> knowledge. Additionally, the students will be supported in teaming up to exchange knowledge and
> work on joint papers (see 1.3.1). The students will further be encouraged to participate in events by
> the field of excellence CCG, e.g., the Forum, presentations or workshops. Exposure to the
> international scientific community (presentations at conferences and workshops, research stays, see 1.3.1) will be a key element of the doctoral training, not only for building up a personal network, but also to get inspiration, to learn about timely research questions, grand challenges, and the latest methodological developments.
> The assessment according to highest international standards, the integration into the research at the
> University of Graz, and the exposure to the international community will ensure the highest performance of the PhD students in HOT.DOC.
> 20
> 1.4 Organisational structure
> As described above, the PhD students that we plan to educate through HOT.DOC will become part of Doctoral Programme Climate Change (DPCC) with the following structure (see Figure 2).
> Figure 2: Organisational structure of DPCC and HOT.DOC.
> The governing body of the DPCC is the Faculty meeting, chaired by its speaker (or in absence of the
> speaker by the co-speaker). Each Faculty member has one vote in the meeting, the majority decides.
> Faculty meetings are held at least every three months. The Faculty meeting elects the speaker and cospeaker for a four-year period. It approves of the admission of doctoral students, establishes training
> facilities for the doctoral students, develops strategies of interactions between students and research
> teams, and fosters the long-term vision of the program as a whole. Detailed rules regarding
> intellectual property rights and rules of author/co-authorship will also be developed by the Faculty
> meeting. It also responds to the reports of the Scientific advisory board. The Faculty members have the responsibility to advise students in their respective thesis project; take all necessary measures to
> prevent drop-outs or a duration of the PhD thesis work considerably longer than three years; report to
> their colleagues on their efforts in advising PhD students; participate in the evaluation of the success
> of all PhD students; organise, participate in, and develop the training program of the DPCC; participate in the faculty meeting; decide on applications in a timely manner and to participate
> actively in decisions on memberships; participate in dissemination activities; provide reports as
> required by the funding organisations. The Faculty meeting will be supported by the research manager of the Field of Excellence Climate Change Graz.
> All student members of the DPCC make up the Students’ conference. The Students’ conference is
> the representation and decision body for student issues. It will be started by the Faculty meeting but is
> expected to provide its own rules (self-governed). The Students’ conference may call for any topic to
> be dealt with in the Faculty meeting. It elects the student speaker and the student co-speaker for
> 21
> periods of one year. The student speaker has the right and the responsibility to communicate the
> students’ proposals (e.g. suggestions for improvement of the training program) and complaints to the
> Faculty meeting; participate in the faculty meeting when invited; and chairs the students’ conference.
> Student issues, including resolving any issues between students, will be handled in the Students’ conference.
> Beyond the requirements of the respective Doctoral programs in the Schools of Environmental Sciences, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences, the student members have the
> responsibilities to participate actively in the training program of the DPCC; actively pursue their studies and the thesis project such that a timely completion is achieved; operate in the monitoring
> process of the thesis project; participate in and contribute to the students’ conference. Students are
> thus required to earnestly pursue their research and fulfil their duties as members of the doctoral programme. The supervisor (Faculty member) needs to remind them of this duty. If a successful completion of the PhD work is in danger, the faculty member is obliged to bring the case to the
> faculty meeting, who has to decide upon extension of the student’s contract.
> The Science Advisory Board (Johannes Quaas, University of Leipzig; Veruska Muccione, WSL; Ivo
> Wallimann-Helmer, Université de Fribourg) will play an important part in the self-evaluation process
> of HOT.DOC. It is expected to provide a written progress report to the Faculty meeting following
> each of their board meetings.
> Conflict Management: The major focus is on a precautionary setting that lowers the likelihood of conflicts. In case a conflict arises and cannot be resolved quickly within a faculty meeting, a
> mediation process will be started. The goal is to transform a conflict into a fruitful innovation in the
> DK. If agreement cannot be reached, a three-person conflict resolution body will be formed,
> consisting of the co-speaker (chairing this body), and one person nominated by each of the two
> conflict parties and accepted by the respective other party. This resolution body prepares a solution
> suggestion to be accepted or declined by the faculty meeting after hearing the positions of the conflict parties. For conflicts between students and supervisors see above (1.3.3).
> Regarding their workplaces the doctoral students will have an office either at the institutes of their main supervisor or at a joint HOT.DOC office space. This joint office space will be organised in a
> flexible manner to create opportunities for interdisciplinary work and mutual learning. Furthermore,
> students will have access to research and teaching infrastructure, such as IT and library services,
> direct contact to researchers in other research groups, and further research infrastructure.
> The University of Graz also provides training opportunities for supervisors. Under the motto
> Lifelong learning, the Human Resources and Organisational Development of the University of Graz and educational partners provide faculty members with further education opportunities.

> - **Career Support Programs**: Specific programs are in place to support women scientists and to help students integrate into professional networks outside academia.
> 
> #### Gender-appropriate Design
> **Assessment: Proactive and Inclusive**
> 
> **Reasons**:
> - **Targeted Gender Balance**: The program has a demonstrated commitment to achieving gender balance and has a higher proportion of female faculty and students than required by targets.
> - **Gender Mainstreaming in Committees**: Ensuring mixed-gender representation on decision-making committees contributes to an equitable environment.
> - **Family-friendly Policies**: Initiatives like the Career Program for Women Scientists reflect an understanding of gender-specific challenges, enhancing support for balancing family and professional roles.
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> Overall, the education and training program at the University of Graz demonstrates strong transparency in selection and evaluation procedures, robust support structures for PhD candidates, comprehensive training content, rich opportunities for additional qualifications, and a thoughtful approach to gender inclusivity. Its focus on interdisciplinary and international elements further ensures that graduates are well-equipped to lead in their respective fields.

> Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most pressing issues of the Anthropocene. While
> both issues are interconnected, they are, in practice, largely addressed in separate domains3.
> HOT.DOC will be a pioneering doctoral programme integrating the two fields from a risk perspective.
> The breadth of the involved faculty, spanning disciplines from physical climate and cryospheric

> research and education.
> 1.5.1 Added value for doctoral candidates
> Addressing climate change, adaptation and biodiversity loss from a holistic perspective requires
> scientists and practitioners with integrated interdisciplinary knowledge. HOT.DOC will provide
> doctoral training serving both needs and prepare their candidates for a career inside as well as outside
> academia. The large research community of HOT.DOC, made up by the candidates themselves, the
> faculty and the support research staff, will enable a vivid, inspiring and fruitful exchange and learning
> experience that would not be possible in individual projects.
> The international research stays at high profile institutions as well as the engagement of the PIs in key
> international initiatives (e.g., IPCC, WCRP, CORDEX) will foster networking and provide ideal career opportunities as postdocs. Likewise, the PIs closely collaborate with regional, national and international stakeholders (e.g., FAO, European Climate Risk Assessment, Horizon Europe Mission
> on Adaptation, Environment Agency, Alpenverein, see also 1.3.1). This collaboration and the
> stakeholder workshop will open career paths outside academia.
> Graduating as an international interdisciplinary cohort rather than an individual increases the visibility
> of the PhD students. The diversity of the student’s cohort provides valuable insights and
> interdisciplinary as well as cultural learning, which would be more difficult as an individual student in
> a research group.
> 1.5.2 Added value for faculty and research institution
> Individual faculty members will directly benefit from HOT.DOC. The integration into an
> interdisciplinary research environment provides valuable feedback from other disciplines and thus
> helps to shape their own research to produce more relevant results. In particular also the input from 10 very diverse PhD students will provide a source of inspiration. Finally, the training programme
> provides an opportunity to offer more research-led teaching than possible in BSc and MSc curricula.
> HOT.DOC will play a key role in the Field of Excellence Climate Change Graz (CCG). Over the last decade, the DKCC was successful in integrating physical climate science with economics, humanities and law into a strong research and training community. When establishing CCG, excellent experts in
> ecology and biodiversity joined this community, but collaboration was so far limited to small,
> individual research projects. HOT.DOC will therefore go a step further and build a joint community
> 23
> integrating across all climate risk science in CCG, including ecology.
> The funding of 10 PhD positions will establish a critical mass to create a high-level research and
> training programme of great international visibility. Experience from the graduate school “Climate
> Change - Uncertainties, Thresholds and Coping Strategies” (see 1.1.1.) makes us confident that HOT.DOC will serve as a nucleus for further research on climate risks and the nexus of climate
> change, society and biodiversity, including individual projects, collaborations with other Austrian and
> international research institutions. Existing other projects, at individual research group level as well as
> large-scale national projects such as ABOL (cooperation on biodiversity, coordinated by University of Graz, https://www.abol.ac.at/), and especially PhD students working in these projects, will be
> associated with HOT.DOC to strengthen collaboration. In the medium term, the research kicked-off by HOT.DOC can be expanded to the new Austrian Sermilik research station on Greenland, led by
> Wofgang Schöner (HOT.DOC faculty).
> A strategic collaboration will be sought with the University of Leipzig. Both Universities already
> collaborate within the ARQUS alliance of Universities. Johannes Quaas, professor at the University of Leipzig and serving on the SAB of HOT.DOC, coordinates the initiative Breathing Nature, which
> integrates world-class expertise on biodiversity and climate change from, e.g., the Helmholtz Centre
