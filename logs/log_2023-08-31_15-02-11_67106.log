> Certainly, here's a narrative of your notes:
> 
> From 2011 to 2020, Delaware's marine recreational fishing involved an average of 216 anglers annually, peaking at 318 and dropping to a minimum of 133 in some years. The vast majority of these anglers were from out-of-state (average of 125 anglers), with the remaining being local coastal residents (average of 91 anglers). No specific record was found of non-coastal Delaware residents partaking in recreational fishing.
> 
> Regarding the fishing effort measured in number of trips taken, on average, a total of 2.29 million trips were made annually within this time period, with a maximum of 2.88 million and a minimum of 1.99 million. Among the differing fishing modes, shore fishing was the most popular accounting for nearly 1.48 million trips. Private boating also saw considerable engagement with around 788,000 trips. For-hire trips were the least common, yet still substantial with an average of 22,000 trips annually.
> 
> In terms of species targeted, Atlantic croaker was the most commonly harvested, with an annual average of 230 thousand fish, and also the most released species with an average of 586 thousand fish returned each year. Summer flounder and Bluefish were the next most frequently caught species, with averages of 133 and 150 thousand fish harvested annually, respectively. Of the key species listed, Atlantic mackerel and Yellowfin tuna had the lowest number of both harvested and released fish. Itâ€™s also worth noting that considerable numbers of Tautog and Black sea bass were harvested (195 and 86 thousand, respectively on average) and released as well, suggesting their abundance and interest amongst the anglers.

> From 2011 to 2020, Delaware's marine recreational fishing involved an average of 216 anglers annually, with a majority (125) coming from out-of-state. Shore fishing was the most popular, accounting for around 1.48 million trips, followed by private boating with approximately 788,000 trips. Atlantic croaker was the most commonly harvested species (average of 230 thousand fish), while summer flounder and bluefish were also popular targets. Tautog and black sea bass were notable for both their harvest and release numbers. Overall, these findings highlight the significance of recreational fishing in Delaware's marine waters.
