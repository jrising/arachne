Data from 18 bias-corrected CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) were used, covering four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)—SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585—across three future timeframes: near-term (2015–2044), mid-term (2045–2074), and long-term (2075–2100). Under the high-emission SSP585 scenario, average temperatures are projected to rise by up to 3.76 °C, and annual precipitation could increase by 52.6%, reaching up to 3446.38 mm by the end of the century. The maximum temperature (Bio5) could reach 32.91 °C, while the minimum temperature (Bio6) might rise by 4.43 °C, particularly during winter. Precipitation seasonality (Bio15) is projected to increase by as much as 7.9% in the northwest, indicating heightened variability between wet and dry seasons. The diurnal temperature range (Bio2) is expected to decrease by up to − 1.3 °C, signifying reduced nighttime cooling, which could exacerbate heat stress. Significant reductions in temperature seasonality (Bio4) are forecast for the northeast, with notable declines in isothermality (Bio3) under SSP585, pointing to increased climatic extremes. These climatic shifts pose severe risks to agricultural productivity, water resource availability, and biodiversity, particularly in flood-prone regions. The findings highlight the need for urgent adaptation measures, including improved flood management systems, efficient water resource use, and climate-resilient agricultural practices. By providing robust region-specific projections, this study offers critical insights for policymakers and stakeholders to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and safeguard environmental and economic sustainability in Bangladesh. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

This study explores the complex relationships among economic extension, energy utilization, financial progress, natural resource rents, and CO2 emissions in Bangladesh. By analyzing annual data from 1974 to 2022, our analysis reveals a long-term connection between the variables, as evidenced by the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test. We found that for every 1% rise in economic growth, energy use, financial progress, and natural resource rents, CO2 emissions rise by 0.13%, 1.50%, 0.39%, and 0.04%, respectively. This is based on the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) method. The outcomes are further supported by the canonical cointegrating regression (CCR), followed by fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). By illuminating the causes of Bangladesh's environmental degradation, this study offers actionable policy suggestions aimed at fostering sustainable growth and enforcing strict regulations that effectively mitigate environmental harm.

> 10.1016/j.wds.2024.100144,Bangladesh's pathways to climate-resilient development: A methodical review,"Climate resilient development pathways (CRDP) are procedures that reinforce sustainable development and reduce poverty and inequalities while meeting adaptation and mitigation targets. The study systematically assessed Bangladesh's efforts to combat climate change and evaluated its progress toward CRDP with a degree of confidence approach. It also assessed climate change vulnerability, national climate change plans and policies, climate finance conditions, and environmental sustainability. The study revealed that the recent climate change plans and strategies have transformative, social inclusiveness, gender responsiveness, climate resilience, institutional flexibility and coordination, and target setting and monitoring attributes from a moderate to large extent. However, to implement its recently developed climate plans like the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, Delta Plan, NAP, and NDC, where funding is essential—the nation needs USD 533.7 billion. The study suggests that though the country has implemented several plans and strategies in recent decades, uneven progress has appeared in some important socio-economic and environmental indicators as well as SDGs which signifies low return against investment. It can be concluded that ensuring maximum socio-economic and environmental return on investment, long-term climate finance, strengthening local govt. organizations, adopting region specific and holistic approaches with private sector engagement would advance CRDP attainment as well as a nature positive economy and system transition in Bangladesh. © 2024"
> 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131341,An assessment of anticipated future changes in water erosion dynamics under climate and land use change scenarios in South Asia,"Water erosion has emerged as a significant global environmental challenge, particularly in South Asia, recognized as one of the regions hardest to hit globally by climate change. This study aims to identify the potential erosion hotspots in South Asia and to assess areas under risk in the future due to climate and land use change scenarios. We utilized the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), an empirical erosion model, to estimate erosion for both historical and future periods, considering two distinct Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP126 and SSP585). The baseline model predicts a mean water erosion rate of 10.6 t. ha−1. year−1 in South Asia, with more than 30 t. ha−1. year−1 recorded for 6.3 % of the total land area. Notably, Bangladesh and Nepal exhibit significantly higher erosion rates than other South Asian countries. Further, our projection indicates an + 10 % increase in erosion rates during the near future (2021–2040) under SSP585 compared to the historical estimates. A substantial rise of approximately + 31 % and + 39 % in water erosion rates in South Asia is anticipated during the far future periods of 2061–2080 and 2081–2100 under SSP585. At the country level, Bangladesh (+42 %), Bhutan (+108 %), and Nepal (+70 %) are expected to experience substantial increases in erosion rates during the 2081–2100 period, with India projecting a + 38 % increase. Additionally, a significant + 35 % expansion in the spatial extent of high erosion areas (>30 t. ha−1. year−1) is foreseen in 2081–2100 under SSP585. Furthermore, under the low climate change scenario (SSP126), the impact on the erosion rates is minimal, while under SSP585, a substantial increase in erosion rates is anticipated. Regions such as Southern India, the arid and semi-arid areas near the India-Pakistan border, and the Himalayan foothills are identified as hotspots for significant changes in erosion rates. Acknowledging a certain level of uncertainty, our study provides valuable insights into erosion risk areas in South Asia and their plausible future impacts due to climate and land use changes. This information can assist policymakers in South Asian countries in developing national-level strategies for soil conservation and climate resilience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."
> 10.1002/qj.4645,Climate change quadruples flood-causing extreme monsoon rainfall events in Bangladesh and northeast India,"Bangladesh and northeast India are the most densely populated regions in the world where severe floods as a result of extreme rainfall events kill hundreds of people and cause socio-economic losses regularly. Owing to local high topography, the moisture-carrying monsoon winds converge near southeast Bangladesh (SEB) and northeast Bangladesh and India (NEBI), which produces significant extreme rainfall events from May to October. Using observed data, we find an increasing trend of 1-day extreme event ((Formula presented.) 150 mm (Formula presented.) day (Formula presented.)) frequency during 1950–2021. The extreme rainfall events quadrupled over western Meghalaya (affecting NEBI) and coastal SEB during this period. Composite analysis indicates that warm Bay of Bengal sea-surface temperature intensifies the lower tropospheric moisture transport and flux through the low-level jet (LLJ) to inland, where mountain-forced moisture converges and precipitates as rainfall during extreme events. To understand the role of climate change, we use high-resolution downscaled models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). We find that the monsoon extreme event increase is ongoing and the region of quadrupled events further extends over the NEBI and SEB in the future (2050–2079) compared with historical simulations (1950–1979). A quadrupling of the intense daily moisture transport episodes due to increased LLJ instability, a northward shift of LLJ, and increased moisture contribute to the increased future extreme events. This dynamic process causes moisture to be transported to the NEBI from the southern Bay of Bengal, and the local thermodynamic response to climate change contributes to the increased extreme rainfall events. The CMIP6 projection indicates that more devastating flood-causing extreme rainfall events will become more frequent in the future. © 2023 The Authors.

Bangladesh, being densely populated and a significant carbon emitter, must urgently reduce its “carbon-dioxide emissions”. The primary objectives of this research are to meticulously examine the impact of green growth, non-renewable energy, renewable energy, and technological innovations on carbon dioxide emissions in Bangladesh from 1990 to 2020, with the goal of informing policies for effective and sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. The analysis using advanced econometric methods, including autoregressive distributed lag, fully modified ordinary least squares, and canonical cointegration regression, reveals that green growth and technological innovations have adverse long-term but positive short-term effects on carbon emissions in Bangladesh. Additionally, it is noteworthy that both non-renewable and renewable energy sources significantly contribute to long-term and short-term carbon emissions. The study confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve, showing a “∩” shaped relationship between green development and carbon emissions. Policymakers should prioritize green growth, incentivize technological innovation, promote sustainable economic practices, and implement comprehensive energy transition strategies. The insights from this study inform policy formulation to address the complex relationships between green growth, energy sources, and carbon-dioxide emissions for sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh’s efforts contribute to global emission reduction and foster a resilient future. Copyright © 2024 Akther, Sultanuzzaman, Zhang, Almutlaq and Huq."

Weather-based index insurance is one of the ways of dealing with these disasters. Protecting against floods and providing risk cover against losses due to floods has been a major area of concern for any government. Risk transfer through insurance is an important component in managing agricultural risks from extreme flood events. The study developed the first of its kind of design and implementation of an index-based flood insurance (IBFI) product with the advanced use of satellite data and flood models to estimate crop losses due to floods. IBFI insurance product uses two different data elements, and the first one is based on the flood model using HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS that uses inputs from NASA GPM bias-corrected satellite rainfall estimates, observed water level and discharge data, river characteristics, and digital elevation model to generate flood depth and flood duration to develop predetermined thresholds based on the historical flood events between 1991 and 2015 and the second IBFI product uses only satellite data from NASA MODIS Terra and Aqua satellite data and the Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR data to generate flood depth and flood duration to develop predetermined thresholds based on the historical flood events and economic losses. More than 7000 farming households in Bihar (India) and northern Bangladesh have signed up for a pilot IBFI scheme, which went live in 2017. The participating farmers have received insurance compensation for crop losses of over $US160,000. In addition to the insurance product implementation, the research evaluated the farming willingness to pay, developing business models for scaling, social equity, and economic benefits of derisk disasters. IBFI initiative promotes a closer linkage between risk transfer and risk reduction that could make this a more sustainable and robust financial instrument for flood-affected communities and reduce the burden of postdisaster relief funds for the government. In summary, index insurance using open-access satellite imagery is a win-win opportunity as it brings down the data development cost, lower insurance premiums, quick settlement, and greater transparency among various users. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

> 10.1007/978-3-031-45093-8_1,"Bangladesh in Transformation: Geography, People, Economy, and Environment","Bangladesh is transforming from a rural subsistence agricultural economic system to a mixed economic partner that complements global processes. It exemplifies contemporary changes in the global south where mismatches often develop in the processes linking resources – activities – environment – sustainability, partially due to insufficient baseline knowledge. This book uses an interdisciplinary scientific approach to understand the real-time problems associated with these transformations and to identify possible solutions. Bangladesh is approaching a vulnerable situation of environmental degradation and raising questions of sustainability in resource exploitation as faster growth in GDP is depleting natural resources, creating soil degradation and resource scarcities along with severe pollution problems. These changes are creating significant economic growth alongside great unevenness in natural resource availability, a prime example being the rapid growth of fresh and saltwater aquaculture that exists alongside a collapse in the number of aquatic species and biodiversity. Parallel problems are manifesting in other areas. These problems are also compounded by the long-term challenges associated with global climate change with more volatile rainfall, increased storm intensity, and sea-level rise. This book should help academics, policymakers, and activists engaged in environmental studies and development activities to better understand these problems and develop solutions. Our goal is to open up windows to investigate these problems further and to widen the knowledge frontier. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

The production of hydrogen using renewable and sustainable energy sources could be an important step in zero carbon emission initiatives. This paper investigates the potential of solar-wind-battery based hybrid microgrid energy architecture for powering a hydrogen production plant to produce 150 kg of hydrogen daily. The plant is proposed to be located in Teknaf, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The optimal solution of microgrid design is based on the criteria of energy costs, meeting demand requirements, and limiting excess electricity. The optimal design includes 2.6 MW of solar panels and five 100 kW wind turbines. This integrated system adeptly meets the target energy demand while demonstrating surplus electricity generation of 11.9% through a detailed analysis of various operational scenarios. The paper highlights the economic viability of the microgrid considering both installation and operating costs. The positive environmental impact is evident with an estimated reduction of around 2278 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, emphasizing its role in promoting green and sustainable energy practices. © 2023 IEEE."

The primary goals of the delta plan are to attain food and water security in the long run in this delta along with environmental sustainability and continuous economic growth. The country has been considered as one of the next 11 emerging economies of the world. However, the country is also one of the most climatic vulnerable countries across the globe. Ensuring food security for all remains a key policy challenge for Bangladesh for over a long period. The country also set 2030 as the year to eradicate extreme poverty and to attain the Sustainable Development Goals. In this perspective, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is unique in its nature that sets goals and identifies strategies for a period up to the year 2100. However, the delta plan has missed certain issues that are critical for the sustainable development of the delta. This paper, therefore, offers recommendations for consideration as there are scopes to explore these issues being the delta plan is adaptive in nature. Our recommendation ranges from education and research; from exploring the potential of the blue economy to trans-boundary cooperation for water and energy security; from ensuring food security to food-quality security, water and air quality security and public health; from ensuring credibility of the government institutions to providing a national database with comprehensive household information suitable to enable effective policy intervention during shocks, disasters and pandemic like Covid-19 situation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

In Bangladesh, an average of 6,600 people was killed by a single TC in the 1960s, but this number had decreased to 30 in the 2010s; this reduction was due to a clear improvement in soft measures, such as weather forecasting, warning systems, and mass evacuation coordinated by volunteers. In Vietnam, several strong TCs have recently made landfall, leading to improvements in national disaster management. Although Vietnam's current disaster management budget is smaller than those of the two other countries, large-scale evacuation by local authorities is believed to have minimized casualties. In Japan, shortly after Typhoon Vera in 1959, a comprehensive law on disaster prevention was enacted, and coastal dikes were constructed nationwide, resulting in a considerable reduction in fatalities due to TCs. However, the disaster prevention facilities built in this period are now deteriorating, while Japan’s budget for disaster management is projected to be decreasing. The three countries have advanced their disaster preparedness in response to past TCs and storm surges, but new challenges have also arisen. © 2022 Japan Society of Civil Engineers."

This research investigates the potential of economic growth, renewable energy use, and technological innovation to achieve environmental sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions in Bangladesh. Time series data from 1980 to 2019 were utilized by applying the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach followed by the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method. The DOLS estimate findings show that the long-run coefficient of economic growth is positive and significant with CO2 emissions, indicating a 1% increase in economic growth is related to a 1.3% rise in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the coefficient of renewable energy use is negative and significant, which indicates that increasing renewable energy use by 1% is associated with CO2 emissions reduction by 0.15% in the long run. In addition, the estimated long-run coefficient of technological innovation is negative but not significant, implying that a 1% increase in technological innovation results in a 0.07% reduction in CO2 emissions. The empirical findings reveal that economic growth increases CO2 emissions in Bangladesh while increased renewable energy use and technological innovation help to achieve environmental sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). In addition, the pairwise Granger causality test is utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables. This article provides policy recommendations aimed at a low-carbon economy, promoting renewable energy use, and financing technological advancement, to achieve emission reduction and environmental sustainability in Bangladesh. © 2022 The Author(s)"
> 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150512,Developing socio-ecological scenarios: A participatory process for engaging stakeholders,"Deltas are experiencing profound demographic, economic and land use changes and human-induced catchment and climate change. Bangladesh exemplifies these difficulties through multiple climate risks including subsidence/sea-level rise, temperature rise, and changing precipitation patterns, as well as changing management of the Ganges and Brahmaputra catchments. There is a growing population and economy driving numerous more local changes, while dense rural population and poverty remain significant. Identifying appropriate policy and planning responses is extremely difficult in these circumstances. This paper adopts a participatory scenario development process incorporating both socio-economic and biophysical elements across multiple scales and sectors as part of an integrated assessment of ecosystem services and livelihoods in coastal Bangladesh. Rather than simply downscale global perspectives, the analysis was driven by a large and diverse stakeholder group who met with the researchers over four years as the assessment was designed, implemented and applied. There were four main stages: (A) establish meta-framework for the analysis; (B) develop qualitative scenarios of key trends; (C) translate these scenarios into quantitative form for the integrated assessment model analysis; and (D) a review of the model results, which raises new stakeholder insights (e.g., preferred adaptation and policy responses) and questions. Step D can be repeated leading to an iterative learning loop cycle, and the process can potentially be ongoing. The strong and structured process of stakeholder engagement gave strong local ownership of the scenarios and the wider process. This process can be generalised for widespread application across socio-ecological systems following the same four-stage approach. It demands sustained engagement with stakeholders and hence needs to be linked to a long-term research process. However, it facilitates a more credible foundation for planning especially where there are multiple interacting factors. © 2021 The Authors"
> 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102487,On viability: Climate change and the science of possible futures,"Growing attention to the impacts of climate change around the world has been accompanied by the profusion of discourses about the lives, livelihoods, and geographies that are “viable” and those that are not in the time of climate change. These discourses of viability often invoke concrete physical limits and tipping points suggesting a transcendent natural order. Conversely, I demonstrate how viability is co-produced through political economic structures that exercise power at multiple scales in shaping the environment and understandings of how it is changing. I describe three dialectics of this co-production: epistemic/material (between ideas about viability and their biophysical and political economic conditions), epistemic/normative (between how the world is understood to be and ideas about how we should live in it), and inter-scalar (between geographic scales, where action at one scale shapes both ecologies and understandings of possible action at another). Each of these dialectics shapes the knowledge regimes that govern the ambiguous social and biophysical process of disappearance and foreclosure of livelihood possibilities in the time of climate change. I examine these discourses of viability through narratives of unviable agrarian livelihoods in coastal Bangladesh, as a lens through which to examine the dialectics of viability more broadly. I situate these discourses concretely in relation to an analysis of interdisciplinary social and natural scientific research on ecological and agrarian viability in coastal Bangladesh now and in the future. Across a broad interdisciplinary spectrum, I find that scientific attention to political economy shapes the politics of possibility. Finally, I demonstrate how discourses of viability limit alternative possible economic and ecological futures. I do this through a concrete examination of the co-production of viable agrarian futures within communities in coastal Bangladesh. These alternative visions indicate that the viability of agriculture is shaped by historical and ongoing decisions in the present about cultivation, water management, and development intervention. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

This has been possible with the country’s leadership role in comprehensive planning and action for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction over the decades. Its success in adaptation to climatic risk has been praised in international forums, including the United Nations panel on climate change. The chapter will specify the details of historical actions and measures taken by the government and nongovernment sectors to cope with climate change and associated disasters in Bangladesh. Firstly, it briefly discusses the uncertainty, transformation, impacts, and adaptation features of Bangladesh against the effects of global greenhouse gas emissions or changing nature of climate. Later on, starting with the international context, it discusses disaster risk reduction and the adaptation context of the country. Then, to frame adaptation governance, it discusses the role of the individual, government, and stakeholders in capacity building. It also shows past and future investment scenarios to achieve the milestone of adaptation management at the national level. In addition, the chapter briefly discusses some successful cases and projects of adaptation practices in different sectors and various climate-vulnerable regions. It then describes existing plans, policies, and sectorial response and their integration into the national planning process to resist and adapt to climate change. Finally, it discusses the challenges and the way forward with closing remarks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."

The lockdown measures were ineffective with no sign of flattening the curve. Therefore, the high risk of transmission is evident with an increasing number of affected people. Under this circumstance, a multiple hazards scenario can be developed in this country due to climatic hazards such as cyclones, floods, landslides, heat waves, and the outbreak of infectious diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The country experiences simultaneously the global pandemic, exceptionally prolonged flood along with the recovery stage from the damages due to the cyclone (Amphan). Therefore, these multiple factors have been putting pressure on losing millions of homes, livelihoods, and agricultural crops. This study aimed to assess the potential impact of a simultaneous strike of climatic hazards and infectious disease outbreaks and their possible strategic management in Bangladesh under different scenarios. A mixed methodological approach was followed in this study including a questionnaire survey, in-depth discussion with experts, and extensive literature review to assess the multi-hazard scenario in a resource-limited setting with high population density. A set of statistical techniques were used to analyze the responses (n = 1590) from different social groups (healthcare professionals, academicians, students, Government and NGO officials, and businessman) under three scenarios. The results revealed the high possibility of aggravating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic if there is a climatic hazard such as flood, cyclone have appeared. The majority of the respondents agreed that the situation will become more devastating if there is another outbreak of diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The poor and fragile healthcare system of this country cannot bear such unprecedented pressure. The lack of risk assessment and communication, lack of sectoral coordination might restrict the contingency plan of the government. Therefore, considering the unprecedented worst cases a stringent strategic plan for emergency response, short term and long-term management should have to be formulated. Resilience building through proactive planning and implementation of integrated, inclusive and sustainable strategies will be effective to ensure the health and socio-economic security for multi-hazard threats in the country. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

The continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), from non-renewable energy sources, is the primary driver of climate change. This study sheds light on this issue by examining the historical CO2 emissions of Bangladesh's electricity sector from 1979 to 2018. This study applies the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) method to three distinct scenarios regarding future emissions. The results of the study are as follows: (1) the impact of government action, population, and substitution results show optimistic outcomes, while CO2 intensity and power intensity show negative impacts in lessening carbon emissions; (2) The emissions scenario analysis (ESa) from 1979 to 2040 estimates that the continued interaction of these activities with the population and with the coal industry, and predicts that proper deployment of renewable energy technologies can reduce CO2 emissions in Bangladesh; (3) The forecasted results of the analyses suggest that CO2 emissions will peak at 58.97 Mtoe by 2040, which can be reduced by renewable (i.e. solar, wind, biomass) and energy technologies in Bangladesh. Some relevant policy proposals are proffered based on some of the key findings of this study. © 2020 The Author(s)"

Hence, a wide range of often conflicting material interests can be expected surrounding mangrove forest policy and management. These conflicts result in different issues of mangrove policy and management, on which different actors articulate their positions through publicly stated claims. It is unclear, in how far these publicly stated positions and claims resemble the formal interest of the actors only, or if they also reveal parts of their informal interests. In the Sundarbans mangrove forests, a number of issues have arisen, which are of contemporary policy concern. The aim of this study is to identify the most recent issues relating to the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and analyse the actors' claims/arguments on the identified issues which were publicly stated as an expression of formal or informal interest. In order to analyse these public claims, content analysis of selected Bangladeshi national newspapers, experts' deliberations and national policy documents was undertaken as an empirical method to ascertain relevant issues and actors' claims. A theory-based actor typology was applied to distinguish the relevant actors, and the concept of formal and informal interests was employed. The results indicate that the most salient policy issues around mangrove forest policy and management are: establishing Rampal power plant; protection of the Sundarbans forest area; environmental pollution; biodiversity conservation; reputation as a World Natural Heritage Site; relevance for climate change adaptation and mitigation; and local people's livelihoods. Government and Administration are found to be the most active actor in all the observed issues. Surprisingly, only very few administrations partake in public deliberations and the Prime Minister seems to dominate the public debate. This might be explained by the fact that the Rampal power plant project is perceived as the most contentious issue among all actors, with strong discursive support from the Prime Minister. In light of this issue structure, non-governmental actors as well as most bureaucracies are rarely found to actively engage in public debate on mangrove issues while informal interests were being displayed by Prime Minister and non-ruling political parties to a limited extent. Future empirical study to be conducted on the historical trajectory of Rampal power plant addressing the Prime Minister's arguments and environmental concerns of civil society actors. Also it would be worth to map the high degree of bureaucratic rivalry which can be assumed form the conflicting interest in mangrove forests between the responsible ministry—the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and other ministries in their struggle for power. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
> 10.3390/w12020483,"Machine learning to evaluate impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh, 1983-2014","Impacts of climate change adaptation strategies need to be evaluated using principled methods spanning sectors and longer time frames. We propose machine-learning approaches to study the long-term impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh. Available data include socio-economic survey and events data (death, migration, etc.) from 1983-2014. These multidecadal data, rare in their extent and quality, provide a basis for using machine-learning approaches even though the data were not collected or designed to assess the impact of the flood control investments. We test whether the embankment has affected the welfare of people over time, benefiting those living inside more than those living outside. Machine-learning approaches enable learning patterns in data to help discriminate between two groups: here households living inside vs. outside. They also help identify the most informative indicators of discrimination and provide robust metrics to evaluate the quality of the model. Overall, we find no significant difference between inside/outside populations based on welfare, migration, or mortality indicators. However, we note a significant difference in inward/outward movement with respect to the embankment. While certain data gaps and spatial heterogeneity in sampled populations suggest caution in any conclusive interpretation of the flood protection infrastructure, we do not see higher benefits accruing to those living with higher levels of protection. This has implications for Bangladesh's planning for future and more extreme climate futures, including the national Delta Plan, and global investments in climate resilient infrastructure to create positive social impacts. © 2020 by the authors."

However, the effects will be more in countries whose economy depends on agriculture. This study aims to measure the economic impacts of climate change on crop farming in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: A Ricardian model was used to estimate the relationship between net crop income and climate variables. Historical climate data and farm household level data from all climatic zones of Bangladesh were collected for this purpose. A regression model was then developed of net crop income per hectare against long-term climate, household and farm variables. Marginal impacts of climate change and potential future impacts of projected climate scenarios on net crop incomes were also estimated. Findings: The results revealed that net crop income in Bangladesh is sensitive to climate, particularly to seasonal temperature. A positive effect of temperature rise on net crop income was observed for the farms located in the areas having sufficient irrigation facilities. Estimated marginal impact suggests that 1 mm/month increase in rainfall and 10°C increase in temperature will lead to about US$4-15 increase in net crop income per hectare in Bangladesh. However, there will be significant seasonal and spatial variations in the impacts. The assessment of future impacts under climate change scenarios projected by Global Circulation Models indicated an increase in net crop income from US$25-84 per hectare in the country. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study indicate the need for development practitioners and policy planners to consider both the beneficial and harmful effects of climate change across different climatic zones while designing and implementing the adaptation policies in the country. Originality/value: Literature survey of the Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar indicates that this study is the first attempt to measure the economic impacts of climate change on overall crop farming sector in Bangladesh using an econometric model. © 2018, Mohammad Shakhawat Hossain, Lu Qian, Muhammad Arshad, Shamsuddin Shahid, Shah Fahad and Javed Akhter."

Identified by Goldman Sachs as being on a meteoric economic rise, the country has dwarfed India in social improvement also. Attempting to build on these successes, the Bangladeshi government has set the ambitious aim of attaining the status of fully developed country by 2041. This study identifies the trifecta of major risks which could derail Bangladesh's upwards trajectory: the rapid development of robotics and artificial development, the uncertain political and economic global landscape, and the constant threat of climate change and natural disasters. In order to stay on track, the government will need to address various social, political, policy and institutional challenges facing the economy, including poor governance, inadequate physical infrastructure, skill and educational bottlenecks, demographic burden, dwindling social capital and lack of transformational leadership. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."

More specifically, the research aims to figure out the influence of climate change on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate related to different sectors such as agriculture, forest, water, health and infrastructure. It also attempts to explore the effect of climate change on the coastal economy of Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: A set of statistical and econometric techniques, including descriptive and correlation analysis and time series regression model, was applied to address the objective of the research. Sector-wise time series economic data were collected from the World Bank for the period between 1971 and 2013. Climate data were received from the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council online database for the period between 1948 and 2013. Findings: The results from the statistical analysis show that climate variables such as temperature and rainfall have changed between 1948 and 2013 in the context of Bangladesh. The econometric regression analysis demonstrates that an increase by 1°C of annual mean temperature leads to a decrease in the GDP growth rate by 0.44 per cent on average, which is statistically significant at the 5 per cent level. On the other hand, the estimated coefficients of agriculture, industry, services, urbanization and export are positively associated with GDP growth rate, and these are statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Sector-wise correlation analysis provides statistical evidence that climate change is negatively associated with various sectors, such as agriculture, forest, human health and arable land. In contrast, it has a positive relation to water access and electricity consumption. Analysis of coastal regions shows that climate change negatively affects the local economic sectors of the coastal zone of the country. Originality/value: Although this study has received significant insight from the world-renowned research publication “The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review”, there is a dearth of research on the economic impact of climate change in the context of Bangladesh.

In this paper, we present a systematic and in-depth review of existing literature to examine the possibilities of indigenous floating agriculture as a technique for climate change adaptation and sustainable community development in Bangladesh. Our review indicates that the indigenous floating agriculture holds enough potential to help farming communities in the flood prone regions of Bangladesh to sustain lives and livelihoods during floods and long-term waterlogged conditions.

Fish is vital to the 16 million Bangladeshis living near the coast, a number that has doubled since the 1980s. Here, we develop and apply tools to project the long-term productive capacity of Bangladesh marine fisheries under climate and fisheries management scenarios, based on downscaling a global climate model, using associated river flow and nutrient loading estimates, projecting high-resolution changes in physical and biochemical ocean properties, and eventually projecting fish production and catch potential under different fishing mortality targets. We place particular interest on Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha), which accounts for ca. 11% of total catches, and Bombay duck (Harpadon nehereus), a low price fish that is the second highest catch in Bangladesh and is highly consumed by low-income communities. It is concluded that the impacts of climate change, under greenhouse emissions scenario A1B, are likely to reduce the potential fish production in the Bangladesh exclusive economic zone by <10%. However, these impacts are larger for the two target species. Under sustainable management practices, we expect Hilsa shad catches to show a minor decline in potential catch by 2030 but a significant (25%) decline by 2060. However, if overexploitation is allowed, catches are projected to fall much further, by almost 95% by 2060, compared with the Business as Usual scenario for the start of the 21st century. For Bombay duck, potential catches by 2060 under sustainable scenarios will produce a decline of <20% compared with current catches.

Understanding the physical and economic effects of salinity ingress, and planning adaptation, are key to the long-term development of countries where sea level rise (SLR) has been identified as a major risk from climate change. This chaper presents a study conducted in Bangladesh which quantifies the prospective relationship between climate-induced changes in sea level, temperature, rainfall, and altered riverine flows from the Himalayas, and the spread and intensity of salinization on river water in the coastal zone in 2050. The research takes into account the projected land subsidence of the Ganges Delta, as well as alternative scenarios of upstream withdrawal of freshwater. The findings indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwest coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050. These changes are likely to lead to significant shortages of drinking water in the coastal urban areas, scarcity of water for irrigation for dry-season agriculture, and significant changes in the coastal aquatic ecosystems. Changes in the availability of freshwater fish will likely affect the composition of capture fishery, although the increase in brackishwater will enhance opportunities for brackishwater aquaculture.Assessment of location-specific economic impacts of the changes in river salinity, identification of suitable adaptation alternatives, and costing of adaptation are high priorities for further analysis. © 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

A changing climate could have both beneficial and harmful effects on crops. Keeping the above view in mind, this study is undertaken to investigate the impacts of climate change (viz. changes in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunshine) on the yield and cropping area of four major food crops (viz. Aus rice, Aman rice, Boro rice and wheat) in Bangladesh. Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard error (HAC) and feasible generalized least square (FGLS) methods were used to determine the climate-crop interrelations using national level time series data for the period of 1972-2010. Findings revealed that the effects of all the climate variables have had significant contributions to the yield and cropping area of major food crops with distinct variation among them. Maximum temperature statistically significantly affected all the food crops' yield except Aus rice. Maximum temperature also insignificantly affected cropping area of all the crops. Minimum temperature insignificantly affected Aman rice but benefited other three crops' yield and cropping area. Rainfall significantly benefitted cropping area of Aus rice, but significantly affected both yield and cropping area of Aman rice. Humidity statistically positively contributed to the yield of Aus and Aman rice but, statistically, negatively influenced the cropping area of Aus rice. Sunshine statistically significantly benefitted only Boro rice yield. Overall, maximum temperature adversely affected yield and cropping area of all the major food crops and rainfall severely affected Aman rice only. Concerning the issue of climate change and ensuring food security, the respective authorities thus should give considerable attention to the generation, development and extension of drought (all major food crops) and flood (particularly Aman rice) tolerant varieties. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this paper, we propose a framework for global flood risk assessment for river floods, which can be applied in current conditions, as well as in future conditions due to climate and socio-economic changes. The framework's goal is to establish flood hazard and impact estimates at a high enough resolution to allow for their combination into a risk estimate, which can be used for strategic global flood risk assessments. The framework estimates hazard at a resolution of ∼ 1 km2 using global forcing datasets of the current (or in scenario mode, future) climate, a global hydrological model, a global flood-routing model, and more importantly, an inundation downscaling routine. The second component of the framework combines hazard with flood impact models at the same resolution (e.g. damage, affected GDP, and affected population) to establish indicators for flood risk (e.g. annual expected damage, affected GDP, and affected population). The framework has been applied using the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB, which includes an optional global flood routing model DynRout, combined with scenarios from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE). We performed downscaling of the hazard probability distributions to 1 km2 resolution with a new downscaling algorithm, applied on Bangladesh as a first case study application area. We demonstrate the risk assessment approach in Bangladesh based on GDP per capita data, population, and land use maps for 2010 and 2050. Validation of the hazard estimates has been performed using the Dartmouth Flood Observatory database. This was done by comparing a high return period flood with the maximum observed extent, as well as by comparing a time series of a single event with Dartmouth imagery of the event. Validation of modelled damage estimates was performed using observed damage estimates from the EM-DAT database and World Bank sources. We discuss and show sensitivities of the estimated risks with regard to the use of different climate input sets, decisions made in the downscaling algorithm, and different approaches to establish impact models. © 2013 Author(s)."

The poor in developing countries are most vulnerable where population density is high, and there is high malnutrition, lack of sanitation and water supplies, weak infrastructures (schools, buildings, bridges), inadequate or no social support and limited income opportunities (Eakin 2005; IPCC 2007; WESS 2008). 7.1.1 Conceptualising Climate Change ‘Climate change’ is often referred to as changes in climatic averages and variability brought about by global warming. Independently of global warming, climate change on seasonal, inter-annual, decadal and multidecadal timescales takes place on a regular basis. Seasonal changes are so reliable that environmental and socioeconomic systems tend to adjust themselves well to these changes.

Bangladesh, being densely populated and a significant carbon emitter, must urgently reduce its carbon-dioxide emissions. The primary objectives of this research are to meticulously examine the impact of green growth, non-renewable energy, renewable energy, and technological innovations on carbon dioxide emissions in Bangladesh from 1990 to 2020, with the goal of informing policies for effective and sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. The analysis using advanced econometric methods, including autoregressive distributed lag, fully modified ordinary least squares, and canonical cointegration regression, reveals that green growth and technological innovations have adverse long-term but positive short-term effects on carbon emissions in Bangladesh. Additionally, it is noteworthy that both non-renewable and renewable energy sources significantly contribute to long-term and short-term carbon emissions. The study confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve, showing a boolean AND shaped relationship between green development and carbon emissions. Policymakers should prioritize green growth, incentivize technological innovation, promote sustainable economic practices, and implement comprehensive energy transition strategies. The insights from this study inform policy formulation to address the complex relationships between green growth, energy sources, and carbon-dioxide emissions for sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's efforts contribute to global emission reduction and foster a resilient future."

Using the Just-Pope production function as an analytical framework, this study assesses the impacts of climate variables on the mean and variability in yield of three major rice crops: Aus, Aman and Boro in Bangladesh for the period 1972-2009. The results reveal that the effects of changes in climate variables vary among the crops. Average maximum temperature emerges as risk-increasing for Aus and Aman rice while it is risk-decreasing for Boro rice yield. Mean minimum temperature is risk-increasing for Boro rice and risk-decreasing for Aus and Aman crops. Finally, rainfall is risk-increasing for Aman rice whilst risk-decreasing for Aus and Boro rice. Regional dummies for some climate zones are also found to be statistically significant. Future climate change is expected to increase the variability of all three rice crops. However, the variability will be higher for Aman than Aus and Boro rice crops. These results have important implications for the allocation of agricultural land among the different rice crops and for devising appropriate climate zone-specific adaptation policies to reduce rice yield variability and ensure food security in developing countries like Bangladesh.

For farmers, diversification, including crop and income diversification, is one of the most effective strategies to improve rural livelihoods by managing risk and coping with weather shocks. We investigate the empirical linkages among weather shocks, livelihood diversification, and household food security, exploiting three waves of nationally representative rural household panel data merged with granular weather data in Bangladesh. Using instrumental variable methods to control for the possible endogeneity of livelihood diversification decisions, we find that weather shocks are significant drivers of crop and income diversification. Moreover, both crop and income diversification are found to impact per capita food expenditure, while their effects on household dietary diversity are not robust. In particular, the distributional effects of income diversification are uniformly positive and significant for all quantiles of a per capita food expenditure distribution but are more sizable for the richest households. The findings, therefore, highlight the unequal effect of livelihood diversification within the context of rural South Asia, suggesting the need for diversification interventions targeting rural low-income groups with the goal of improving socioeconomic status, institutional conditions, and infrastructure."

We utilized the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), an empirical erosion model, to estimate erosion for both historical and future periods, considering two distinct Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP126 and SSP585). The baseline model predicts a mean water erosion rate of 10.6 t. ha(-1). year(-1) in South Asia, with more than 30 t. ha(-1). year(-1) recorded for 6.3 % of the total land area. Notably, Bangladesh and Nepal exhibit significantly higher erosion rates than other South Asian countries. Further, our projection indicates an + 10 % increase in erosion rates during the near future (2021-2040) under SSP585 compared to the historical estimates. A substantial rise of approximately + 31 % and + 39 % in water erosion rates in South Asia is anticipated during the far future periods of 2061-2080 and 2081-2100 under SSP585. At the country level, Bangladesh (+42 %), Bhutan (+108 %), and Nepal (+70 %) are expected to experience substantial increases in erosion rates during the 2081-2100 period, with India projecting a + 38 % increase. Additionally, a significant + 35 % expansion in the spatial extent of high erosion areas (>30 t. ha(-1). year(-1)) is foreseen in 2081-2100 under SSP585. Furthermore, under the low climate change scenario (SSP126), the impact on the erosion rates is minimal, while under SSP585, a substantial increase in erosion rates is anticipated. Regions such as Southern India, the arid and semi-arid areas near the India-Pakistan border, and the Himalayan foothills are identified as hotspots for significant changes in erosion rates. Acknowledging a certain level of uncertainty, our study provides valuable insights into erosion risk areas in South Asia and their plausible future impacts due to climate and land use changes. This information can assist policymakers in South Asian countries in developing national-level strategies for soil conservation and climate resilience."

Owing to local high topography, the moisture-carrying monsoon winds converge near southeast Bangladesh (SEB) and northeast Bangladesh and India (NEBI), which produces significant extreme rainfall events from May to October. Using observed data, we find an increasing trend of 1-day extreme event (>150 mmday(-1)) frequency during 1950-2021. The extreme rainfall events quadrupled over western Meghalaya (affecting NEBI) and coastal SEB during this period. Composite analysis indicates that warm Bay of Bengal sea-surface temperature intensifies the lower tropospheric moisture transport and flux through the low-level jet (LLJ) to inland, where mountain-forced moisture converges and precipitates as rainfall during extreme events. To understand the role of climate change, we use high-resolution downscaled models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). We find that the monsoon extreme event increase is ongoing and the region of quadrupled events further extends over the NEBI and SEB in the future (2050-2079) compared with historical simulations (1950-1979). A quadrupling of the intense daily moisture transport episodes due to increased LLJ instability, a northward shift of LLJ, and increased moisture contribute to the increased future extreme events. This dynamic process causes moisture to be transported to the NEBI from the southern Bay of Bengal, and the local thermodynamic response to climate change contributes to the increased extreme rainfall events. The CMIP6 projection indicates that more devastating flood-causing extreme rainfall events will become more frequent in the future."
> 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102487,On viability: Climate change and the science of possible futures,"Growing attention to the impacts of climate change around the world has been accompanied by the profusion of discourses about the lives, livelihoods, and geographies that are viable and those that are not in the time of climate change. These discourses of viability often invoke concrete physical limits and tipping points suggesting a transcendent natural order. Conversely, I demonstrate how viability is co-produced through political economic structures that exercise power at multiple scales in shaping the environment and understandings of how it is changing. I describe three dialectics of this co-production: epistemic/material (between ideas about viability and their biophysical and political economic conditions), epistemic/normative (between how the world is understood to be and ideas about how we should live in it), and inter-scalar (between geographic scales, where action at one scale shapes both ecologies and understandings of possible action at another). Each of these dialectics shapes the knowledge regimes that govern the ambiguous social and biophysical process of disappearance and foreclosure of livelihood possibilities in the time of climate change. I examine these discourses of viability through narratives of unviable agrarian livelihoods in coastal Bangladesh, as a lens through which to examine the dialectics of viability more broadly. I situate these discourses concretely in relation to an analysis of interdisciplinary social and natural scientific research on ecological and agrarian viability in coastal Bangladesh now and in the future. Across a broad interdisciplinary spectrum, I find that scientific attention to political economy shapes the politics of possibility. Finally, I demonstrate how discourses of viability limit alternative possible economic and ecological futures. I do this through a concrete examination of the co-production of viable agrarian futures within communities in coastal Bangladesh. These alternative visions indicate that the viability of agriculture is shaped by historical and ongoing decisions in the present about cultivation, water management, and development intervention."

The aim is to delve into locally held understandings of the phenomenon and to gain a better understanding of these migration processes, which are actively intertwined with local experiences. Both Indian and Bangladeshi experts were interviewed using semi-structured, in-depth interviews in order to explore insights from locally held perceptions and understandings of contextual factors. In total, 10 Bangladeshi and 15 Indian experts were interviewed, covering different disciplines, sectors, regions and job types, together providing a more complete and grounded picture of views of environmentally induced migration in Bangladesh and India. The results show that climate change is perceived by local experts as one of the key factors influencing migration in Bangladesh, both internally and externally. The interviewees, however, placed environmentally induced migration in a broader context of labour and economic migration. In particular, migration for environmental reasons in Bangladesh was evident long before the emergence of climate change as an issue. According to the interviewed experts, this does not preclude increased environmentally induced migration within and from Bangladesh in the future, but its analyses ought to be placed in historical and economical contexts."

Following the fetal origin hypothesis, we hypothesize that children from households with greater exposure will have poorer health, schooling, and consumption outcomes. Employing a unique dataset from Bangladesh, we test this hypothesis for the 1970 cyclone that killed over 300,000 people in southern Bangladesh. We find that children surviving the cyclone experience significant health, schooling and consumption adversities, and during their adulthood, have lower probabilities of good health and primary schooling; and lower durations of good health, schooling and consumption. Such adversities are further heightened among the rural and less-educated households. Therefore, public programs benefiting the females and the poor, alongside the development of healthcare and schooling infrastructure, can be useful protective measures against the long-term harms of a disaster.

Using a dynamic economy-wide model of Bangladesh, damages from historical climate variability and future anthropogenic climate change are estimated and decomposed. The stochastic simulation approach used avoids biases caused by non-linear damage functions and fixed occurrences of extreme events in historical data. Using 10 climate projections, it is found that future anthropogenic climate change damages until 2050 are, on average, one-fifth of those from historical climate variability. Climate change also alters the temporal distribution of damages and slows Bangladesh's long run shift (adaptation) into dry (winter) season rice production."

The lockdown measures were ineffective with no sign of flattening the curve. Therefore, the high risk of transmission is evident with an increasing number of affected people. Under this circumstance, a multiple hazards scenario can be developed in this country due to climatic hazards such as cyclones, floods, landslides, heat waves, and the outbreak of infectious diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The country experiences simultaneously the global pandemic, exceptionally prolonged flood along with the recovery stage from the damages due to the cyclone (Amphan). Therefore, these multiple factors have been putting pressure on losing millions of homes, livelihoods, and agricultural crops. This study aimed to assess the potential impact of a simultaneous strike of climatic hazards and infectious disease outbreaks and their possible strategic management in Bangladesh under different scenarios. A mixed methodological approach was followed in this study including a questionnaire survey, in-depth discussion with experts, and extensive literature review to assess the multi-hazard scenario in a resource-limited setting with high population density. A set of statistical techniques were used to analyze the responses (n = 1590) from different social groups (healthcare professionals, academicians, students, Government and NGO officials, and businessman) under three scenarios. The results revealed the high possibility of aggravating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic if there is a climatic hazard such as flood, cyclone have appeared. The majority of the respondents agreed that the situation will become more devastating if there is another outbreak of diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The poor and fragile healthcare system of this country cannot bear such unprecedented pressure. The lack of risk assessment and communication, lack of sectoral coordination might restrict the contingency plan of the government. Therefore, considering the unprecedented worst cases a stringent strategic plan for emergency response, short term and long-term management should have to be formulated. Resilience building through proactive planning and implementation of integrated, inclusive and sustainable strategies will be effective to ensure the health and socio-economic security for multi-hazard threats in the country."

This study examines the impact of droughts on food consumption and nutrition across age and gender cohorts in rural Bangladesh. We utilize georeferenced climate data and panel data from surveys in rural Bangladesh. Findings reveal that droughts lead to an 8.4 % reduction in food expenditure and a decrease in calories, protein, and fat intake by 5.7 %, 5.5 %, and 8.2 %, respectively. The effects are disproportionate across age groups in the household. Women experience a greater decline in food consumption and nutritional intake compared to men, with elderly women being the most severely affected group. Additionally, droughts lead to a less balanced diet, marked by decreased consumption of nutrient-rich animal-source and plant-based foods and an increased reliance on cereals. While safety nets help mitigate the adverse effects of droughts, they do not fully restore consumption to pre-drought levels. Findings from this study highlight the need for targeted interventions that address the specific vulnerabilities of different demographic groups and enhance the effectiveness of safety nets."

We propose machine-learning approaches to study the long-term impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh. Available data include socio-economic survey and events data (death, migration, etc.) from 1983-2014. These multidecadal data, rare in their extent and quality, provide a basis for using machine-learning approaches even though the data were not collected or designed to assess the impact of the flood control investments. We test whether the embankment has affected the welfare of people over time, benefiting those living inside more than those living outside. Machine-learning approaches enable learning patterns in data to help discriminate between two groups: here households living inside vs. outside. They also help identify the most informative indicators of discrimination and provide robust metrics to evaluate the quality of the model. Overall, we find no significant difference between inside/outside populations based on welfare, migration, or mortality indicators. However, we note a significant difference in inward/outward movement with respect to the embankment. While certain data gaps and spatial heterogeneity in sampled populations suggest caution in any conclusive interpretation of the flood protection infrastructure, we do not see higher benefits accruing to those living with higher levels of protection. This has implications for Bangladesh's planning for future and more extreme climate futures, including the national Delta Plan, and global investments in climate resilient infrastructure to create positive social impacts."

The continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon di oxide (CO2), from non-renewable energy sources, is the primary driver of climate change. This study sheds light on this issue by examining the historical CO2 emissions of Bangladesh's electricity sector from 1979 to 2018. This study applies the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) method to three distinct scenarios regarding future emissions. The results of the study are as follows: (1) the impact of government action, population, and substitution results show optimistic outcomes, while CO2 intensity and power intensity show negative impacts in lessening carbon emissions; (2) The emissions scenario analysis (ESa) from 1979 to 2040 estimates that the continued interaction of these activities with the population and with the coal industry, and predicts that proper deployment of renewable energy technologies can reduce CO2 emissions in Bangladesh; (3) The forecasted results of the analyses suggest that CO2 emissions will peak at 58.97 Mtoe by 2040, which can be reduced by renewable (i.e. solar, wind, biomass) and energy technologies in Bangladesh. Some relevant policy proposals are proffered based on some of the key findings of this study."
> 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150512,Developing socio-ecological scenarios: A participatory process for engaging stakeholders,"Deltas are experiencing profound demographic, economic and land use changes and human-induced catchment and climate change. Bangladesh exemplifies these difficulties through multiple climate risks including subsidence/sea-level rise, temperature rise, and changing precipitation patterns, as well as changing management of the Ganges and Brahmaputra catchments. There is a growing population and economy driving numerous more local changes, while dense rural population and poverty remain significant. Identifying appropriate policy and planning responses is extremely difficult in these circumstances. This paper adopts a participatory scenario development process incorporating both socio-economic and biophysical elements across multiple scales and sectors as part of an integrated assessment of ecosystem services and livelihoods in coastal Bangladesh. Rather than simply downscale global perspectives, the analysis was driven by a large and diverse stakeholder group who met with the researchers over four years as the assessment was designed, implemented and applied. There were four main stages: (A) establish meta-framework for the analysis; (B) develop qualitative scenarios of key trends; (C) translate these scenarios into quantitative form for the integrated assessment model analysis; and (D) a review of the model results, which raises new stakeholder insights (e.g., preferred adaptation andpolicy responses) and questions. Step D can be repeated leading to an iterative learning loop cycle, and the process can potentially be ongoing. The strong and structured process of stakeholder engagement gave strong local ownership of the scenarios and the wider process. This process can be generalised for widespread application across socio-ecological systems following the same four-stage approach. It demands sustained engagement with stakeholders and hence needs to be linked to a long-term research process. However, it facilitates a more credible foundation for planning especially where there are multiple interacting factors. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

> 10.1016/j.rsase.2023.101069,Long-term quantification of pre and post-monsoon surface water area of Bangladesh,"Since the 1990s, about 70 percent of the world's wetland ecosystem have been lost, despite the acknowledged contribution of surface waters to human well-being. Surface water is a prerequisite for agriculture, fisheries, and other human activities. It also significantly impacts the groundwater reserve, soil conditions, the environment, and the surrounding area's ecology. Bangladesh's population and economic expansion have increased the need for water resources. Therefore, monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water resources is essential. The present study used more than 2700 Landsat scenes from 1990 to 2020 to quantify the total surface water area utilizing the strength of cloud computing in the Google Earth Engine platform. MannKendall trend analysis was performed to understand the trend of the surface water area. In 1990 the total pre-monsoon and post-monsoon surface water areas were 7994.91 km2 and 11453.43 km2 which is 5.38% and 7.71% of the total countries area, respectively. In 2010 and 2020, the water area was 10748.61 km2 (7.24%) and 10313.49 km2 (6.94%), respectively, in the pre-monsoon; and 10794.05 km2 (7.27%) and 15570.36 km2 (10.48%) respectively in the postmonsoon season. The overall change between 2020 and 1990 is 7994.91 km2 (1.89%) in the premonsoon season and 4116.93 (2.77%) in the post-monsoon season. The maximum average surface water area in the post-monsoon season was found in Sylhet (22.68%), followed by Khulna (14.52%). Rangpur was found to have the least average surface water area in both seasons (2.85% and 3.57%). Coastal regions showed a significant increasing trend in the surface water area in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings have significant implications for sustainable surface water management decisions, priority interventions, legal frameworks, and public policies to conserve valuable surface water resources in Bangladesh."
> 10.1007/s10668-023-03497-2,Killing billions to save millions? Analyzing the double jeopardy of fossil-fuel-led economic development in Bangladesh,"According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Bangladesh is the world's seventh most climate-vulnerable nation. Being on the verge of facing extreme climatic backlash emerging from unwitting economic development, Bangladesh must comprehend that the current economic growth is not a panacea for its environmental integrity. However, considering Bangladesh's recent economic sustainability, curbing economic development will be uninviting. As such, we propose a conceptual framework to obtain environmental integrity without decommissioning economic development. Deploying data from 1972 to 2020 and novel econometric methodologies, we unearth that FDI ameliorates Bangladesh's environmental quality, whereas export with no comparative advantage jeopardizes it due to its redundancy issue. Considering export and FDI as substitutionary in Bangladesh, we support for FDI-led development for an interim period until the redundant export issue is resolved. Furthermore, exchange rate depreciation increases CO2 emissions. We advocate an exchange rate appreciation policy that will curb redundant exports and improve environmental quality. Findings also validate the EKC hypothesis in both the short run and long run. Turning point estimation indicates that Bangladesh is still below the required income level to phase out growth-induced CO2 emissions. Moreover, natural resource rent improves environmental quality, whereas consumption of non-renewables degrades it. Besides, gross domestic savings (GDS), agricultural value-addition (AVA), and primary schooling increase emissions. We propose GDS and FDI be channeled into the AVA sectors to equip them with green technologies. This paper further suggests including fundamental concepts of climate change education in pre- and secondary-level textbooks to indoctrinate the younger section of society on environmental pollution."

The impact of LULC change and flooding on poverty is complex and poorly understood. This study presents a spatiotemporal appraisal of poverty in relation to LULC change and pluvial flood risk in the south western embanked area of Bangladesh. A combination of logistic regression (LR), cellular automata (CA), and Markov Chain models were utilised to predict future LULC based on historical data. Flood risk assessment was performed at present and for future LULC scenarios. A spatial regression model was developed, incorporating multiple parameters to estimate the wealth index (WI) for present-day and future scenarios. In the study area, agricultural lands reduced from 34 % in 2005 to 8% in 2010, while aquaculture land cover increased from 17 % to 39 % during the same time. The rate of LULC change was relatively low between 2010 and 2019. Based on the recent trend, LULC was predicted for the year 2030. Flood risk was positively correlated with LULC and the expected annual damage (EAD) was estimated at $903 million in 2005, which is likely to increase to $2096 million by 2030, considering changes in LULC scenarios. The analysis further showed that the EAD and LULC change were negatively associated with the WI. Despite consistent national GDP growth in Bangladesh in recent years, the rate of increase of WI is likely to be low in the future because flood risk and patterns of LULC change have a negative effect on WI."

Hence, a wide range of often conflicting material interests can be expected surrounding mangrove forest policy and management. These conflicts result in different issues of mangrove policy and management, on which different actors articulate their positions through publicly stated claims. It is unclear, in how far these publicly stated positions and claims resemble the formal interest of the actors only, or if they also reveal parts of their informal interests. In the Sundarbans mangrove forests, a number of issues have arisen, which are of contemporary policy concern. The aim of this study is to identify the most recent issues relating to the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and analyse the actors' claims/arguments on the identified issues which were publicly stated as an expression of formal or informal interest. In order to analyse these public claims, content analysis of selected Bangladeshi national newspapers, experts' deliberations and national policy documents was undertaken as an empirical method to ascertain relevant issues and actors' claims. A theory-based actor typology was applied to distinguish the relevant actors, and the concept of formal and informal interests was employed. The results indicate that the most salient policy issues around mangrove forest policy and management are: establishing Rampal power plant; protection of the Sundarbans forest area; environmental pollution; biodiversity conservation; reputation as a World Natural Heritage Site; relevance for climate change adaptation and mitigation; and local people's livelihoods. Government and Administration are found to be the most active actor in all the observed issues. Surprisingly, only very few administrations partake in public deliberations and the Prime Minister seems to dominate the public debate. This might be explained by the fact that the Rampal power plant project is perceived as the most contentious issue among all actors, with strong discursive support from the Prime Minister. In light of this issue structure, non-governmental actors as well as most bureaucracies are rarely found to actively engage in public debate on mangrove issues while informal interests were being displayed by Prime Minister and non-ruling political parties to a limited extent. Future empirical study to be conducted on the historical trajectory of Rampal power plant addressing the Prime Minister's arguments and environmental concerns of civil society actors. Also it would be worth to map the high degree of bureaucratic rivalry which can be assumed form the conflicting interest in mangrove forests between the responsible ministry-the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and other ministries in their struggle for power."

In Bangladesh, an average of 6,600 people was killed by a single TC in the 1960s, but this number had decreased to 30 in the 2010s; this reduction was due to a clear improvement in soft measures, such as weather forecasting, warning systems, and mass evacuation coordinated by volunteers. In Vietnam, several strong TCs have recently made landfall, leading to improvements in national disaster management. Although Vietnam's current disaster management budget is smaller than those of the two other countries, large-scale evacuation by local authorities is believed to have minimized casualties. In Japan, shortly after Typhoon Vera in 1959, a comprehensive law on disaster prevention was enacted, and coastal dikes were constructed nationwide, resulting in a considerable reduction in fatalities due to TCs. However, the disaster prevention facilities built in this period are now deteriorating, while Japan's budget for disaster management is projected to be decreasing. The three countries have advanced their disaster preparedness in response to past TCs and storm surges, but new challenges have also arisen."

Its primary goal is to protect the Netherlands against floods and ensure the availability of fresh water, now and for future generations. The DP has developed a new, adaptive management concept: the Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) approach. ADM is defined as 'a smart and intelligent way of taking account of uncertainties and dependencies in decision-making on Delta Management with a view to reducing the risk of overspending or underinvestment'. Important features of DP are: (i) involving multiple stakeholders in a joint decision-making process to enhance ownership, legitimacy and feasibility; (ii) taking a risk-based perspective; (iii) adopting a flexible approach in possible strategies by valuing flexibility with regard to the timing of implementation and (iv) interlinking various investment agendas and looking for opportunities for mainstreaming with planned investments. Along similar lines, a Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP 2100) is being devised to achieve long-term sustainable socio-economic development and provide safety in the face of disasters through adaptive water governance in Bangladesh. It embodies a holistic, integrated vision, adaptive strategies and a long-term investment agenda for the Bangladesh Delta. The Plan is scheduled to be finalized in 2017. ADM is not an approach that can be transferred easily from one country to another as it demands a fundamental change in institutional capacity at multiple levels including new knowledge and skills, relationships and policy frameworks, and, hence, depends on the local socioeconomic characteristics, culture and governance. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities for successful formulation and implementation of BDP 2100."

This paper explores the reasons behind this development, tracing the programme run by the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) from its early expansion employing pioneering partnership and financing models, to its more recent decline. It finds that the government's simultaneous implementation of several competing on- and off-grid energy access projects and lack of regulatory oversight alongside significant subsidy decreases which made SHS uncompetitive, led customers to abandon the programme. This, in turn, is putting at risk Bangladesh's objective of achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 - affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all - by 2030. KEY POLICY INSIGHTS: The intended maturation of the market for off-grid solar did not occur alongside the gradual reduction of the SHS programme's subsidy scheme. This resulted in a lack of service and technology providers and continued high system prices, unattainable to poor households in rural Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh's unexpected grid expansion into SHS areas and introduction of free solar energy systems in 2015 further undermined the programme because it led to: o customer's turning away from SHS and defaulting on their loan payments, leading to financial problems for IDCOL's partner organizations. o entry of unregulated sub-standard panels into the market, resulting in a lack of confidence and distrust in the SHS by end-users. center dot A key role of the government is to ensure the sound quality of the systems and services from the outset to instil customer confidence in the product. center dot The creation of successful long-term energy access requires a comprehensive, integrated approach to coordinate stakeholders and oversee market development over time, ensuring that markets for new technologies and services such as SHS have an opportunity to succeed."

These disasters, in turn, have significant implications for sustainable development of this country. In this research, following theoretical and empirical background, we evaluate the role of natural disaster, information and communication technology or ICT, non-renewable energy use, international cooperation in the form of globalization and public sector corruption on sustainable development of Bangladesh. We use the data from 1985 to 2021 and employ robust econometric techniques such as dynamic ARDL simulation. The result from the dynamic ARDL simulation suggests that natural disaster has positive and significant effect on sustainable development of Bangladesh in the short and long run. The use of ICT as well as non-renewable energy has positive and significant impact only in the long run. Furthermore, international cooperation significantly and positively affects sustainable development both in the long run and short run while corruption has no impact in any period. The study finally provides policy recommendations based on the above findings.& COPY; 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

> Thank you. Now, I would like to use Bangladesh as a case study to highlight some key messages about the potential for adaptation investment. Do you see some kind of story coming out from these abstracts?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! The abstracts paint a vivid picture of Bangladesh as a case study for adaptation investment, highlighting several key messages:
> 
> ### 1. **Vulnerability to Climate Change:**
> Bangladesh epitomizes vulnerability to climate impacts like flooding, extreme weather, and agricultural disruption. Studies in the abstracts show rising temperatures, increased monsoon rainfall, and significant erosion anticipated under future scenarios. These vulnerability markers signal an urgent need for comprehensive adaptation strategies.
> 
> ### 2. **Urgency and Scale of Investment:**
> The need for massive adaptation investments is underscored by the estimated requirement of USD 533.7 billion for implementing climate plans like the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan and the Delta Plan. This financial challenge highlights both the enormity and urgency of past and future crises.
> 
> ### 3. **Successful Strategies and Challenges:**
> Bangladesh has seen some adaptation success, as in the adoption of innovative agricultural practices like floating agriculture, which help maintain food security during climate-induced floods. However, inconsistent progress and challenges in sectors like energy demonstrate the complexities involved in adaptation.
> 
> ### 4. **Policy and Institutional Frameworks:**
> The Delta Plan 2100 and other frameworks reflect a forward-thinking policy environment aimed at achieving long-term sustainability. Yet, the need for better financial backing, institutional reforms, and implementation capacity is clear. Effective policies need to merge technological innovation with grassroots engagement.
> 
> ### 5. **Social Dimensions of Adaptation:**
> Climate impacts in Bangladesh have pronounced social dimensions, particularly concerning gender and agricultural livelihoods. Adaptation must consider food security impacts, especially on women and the poor, suggesting targeted interventions that enhance resilience among the most vulnerable groups.
> 
> ### 6. **Integration of Multisectoral Approaches:**
> Successful adaptation in Bangladesh involves integrating diverse factors across sectors: agriculture, infrastructure, energy, and social systems. This calls for a coordinated approach that leverages both local and technological knowledge to drive climate resilience.
> 
> ### 7. **Global Implications:**
> Bangladesh’s experiences with adaptation present broader lessons for global climate policy—highlighting the importance of long-term planning, substantial investment, and multi-level governance. The potential for technological solutions, like green energy transitions and machine learning applications in policy evaluation, offer hope but underscore the need for global cooperation.
> 
> ### Storyline:
> Bangladesh’s story as a frontrunner in adaptation highlights the nation’s existential climate challenges and the innovative strategies pursued to counteract them. Especially relevant are the country’s policy vision and grassroots innovations like floating agriculture, demonstrating both the promise and the funding gap in adaptation efforts. The need for enhanced investment and resilience-building through integrated, inclusive strategies is key to transforming Bangladesh’s vulnerability into a beacon of sustainable development, offering hope and examples for other climate-vulnerable regions.
> 
> The Bangladesh experience can serve as a compelling case for the international community—advocating for greater collaboration and investment in climate adaptation as essential to global sustainability and equitable growth.
