> Uncertainty in the scenarios (ctd): Do we need to account for different natural system CH4 emissions depending on how much CO2 (or warming) there is in a given scenario?
> Explore the full uncertainty of META‘s parameters and TP modules (we currently use mean or median values across some of these)?

> The paper explores the economic benefits of global methane mitigation in the context of avoided climate change. The authors began by updating the social-cost Integrated Assessment Models (META), with a particular focus on incorporating new insights about tipping points. They then estimated the reduction in global warming resulting from methane mitigation efforts and calculated the associated economic benefits. Notably, the study quantifies the extent to which methane mitigation reduces the intensity of tipping points and the associated tail risk. Additionally, the authors provide estimates of the social cost of methane at the country level.
> 
> This research is of interest for its insights into climate pathways involving tipping points and for its country-level analysis of the social cost of methane, areas that have not been fully explored in previous studies. However, the paper’s structure is somewhat unclear, and several key issues are not adequately addressed or discussed. On one hand, I can recognize the efforts and advances made in this work; on the other hand, there are some very important mechanisms that it fails to include.
> 
> Major comments.
> 1. For a scientific journal, the discussion should include concrete numbers to support the analysis. For example, the authors mention that methane levels have increased at a faster rate in recent years but do not provide specific rates or figures. This lack of quantitative data is a recurring issue throughout the manuscript, making it difficult to fully understand the findings and raising questions about the validity of the conclusions. Including precise numerical data would significantly enhance the clarity and credibility of the discussion.
> 
> 2. When discussing methane abatement, particularly for future years, it is crucial to consider the baseline of natural emissions and their projected evolution. There is a consensus that wetland emissions will increase in response to rising temperatures and CO2 fertilization, especially in mid- to high-CO2 scenarios. For example, wetland emissions may double (or increase by 150-200 Tg a-1) by 2100. This significant increase would substantially affect the conclusions of this work. Additionally, other natural emissions, such as those from lakes and wildfires, introduce further uncertainty that must be accounted for in the analysis.
> 
> 3. It is unclear how the model addresses the lifetime of CH4 across different mitigation pathways. As shown in Figure 1 (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115204118), anthropogenic NOx and VOC emissions significantly influence the CH4 lifetime, and their effects on OH levels are non-linear. However, this study does not account for this mechanism, or at least it is not presented anywhere in the manuscript.
> 
> 4. This study completely neglects the air quality and health benefits associated with methane abatement. Are these effects significantly smaller than the climate-related impacts? The authors should either reference existing literature to support this claim or provide their own evaluation to clarify the relative significance of these benefits.
> 
> 5. The authors need to justify the validity of their country-scale estimates of SC-CH4 (Table S4). They can do this by regressing these values against various socioeconomic factors (e.g., GDP, population, etc.). If no robust relationships are found, the validity of these estimates is considerably weakened. This validation process is crucial and should be included. Additionally, the authors should compare their results with existing literature and provide explanations for any discrepancies. Including a table in the supplementary information to summarize these comparisons would be helpful. Although the authors discuss some of these points, the discussion is insufficient and needs to be expanded.
> 
> Minor comments.
> Line 25. Needs to give the uncertainty of 0.13C here. Also for the listed numbers in the following sentences in the abstract.
> Line 34. Briefly mention what is the social cost of CH4 here?
> Line 46. These sentences need to be specific, e.g. at a rapid rate of XXX ppb per decade.
> Line 49-51. Putting the lifetime of CH4 here can better explain how rapidly the atmospheric concentration responds to emission reductions.
> Line 60-63. Still, if the authors can put the numbers of GWP-20 and GWP-100 here, it helps the authors better understand the message.
> Line 75. Methane also elevates tropospheric ozone, which should be mentioned here.
> Line 84-96. How does this model treat natural methane emissions?
> Line 129-133. I can hardly agree with the authors here. The energy sector currently contributes 100-120 Tg of methane annually. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that the expansion of renewable energy could reduce coal, oil, and gas production by 50-80% in many countries by 2050, leading to a similar reduction in methane emissions. The reference [7] used cannot support the argument here.
> Line 158. Needs to give a reference of the baseline emission here.
> Line 164. How much is the uncertainty here? 95% confidence levels? In other words, how do you define the low and high emission scenario.
> Line 199. it mentions that the Global Methane Assessment uses a much higher baseline emission. Needs to give the number of emissions here.
> Line 198-202. I guess the authors still need to explain the difference of 0.2C and 0.3C, instead of just attributing to uncertainty.
> Line 204. Needs to elaborate what the economic benefits of methane action are here.
> Line 249. What is country-level avoided damage? Needs to be more specific here.
> Line 267-270. Given the high uncertainty at the tails, are these changes significant? I can see that the whole distribution has shifted, but the numbers reported here seems to arbitrary due to the large uncertainty.
> Fig. 5. Regarding the tipping points, the authors should address the uncertainty associated with their method. Climate systems are highly complex, and responses to climate forcing are inherently non-linear. I am uncertain whether the method presented here, which appears to be simplified, can accurately or comprehensively simulate these tipping points.
> Line 328. Needs to give the number of SC-CO2.
> Line 325-327. It seems the effects depend on how you choose these tipping points. This adds a lot of uncertainty to the results presented in Fig. 5-6.
> Fig. 6b (bottom panel). Don’t make the colors saturated. The readers are interested in these countries with high SC-CH4.
> About Fig. 6, it is confusing that the mean and median values in the upper panel are an order of magnitude higher than country-level values in the bottom panel.
> Line 425. Finally, the authors began to mention the effects on ozone. Is this impact important? If not, please give reasons.
> Line 660-748. The air quality pathway is not included in the model. Need to give a reason.

> This paper investigates the social cost of methane (SC-CH4), a greenhouse gas that has been relatively understudied but is rapidly gaining attention in recent climate mitigation policies. Given the rising prominence of methane in discussions about global warming, the findings of this study have significant potential implications for policy-making. However, while the study is timely and relevant, its contribution in terms of methodological innovation is somewhat limited, as it largely relies on the well-established META Integrated Assessment Model (IAM). The model used in this research incorporates some altered parameter settings to better serve the specific purpose of the study, but these modifications do not constitute a major methodological advancement.
> 
> One critical point of concern is the scenario setting for methane used in the study. These scenarios lack empirical quantitative support and are instead based purely on the optimistic policy objective of Global Methane Pledge that aims to limit global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Preliminary observations from this year suggest that the average temperature increase may have already surpassed this 1.5-degree target. As such, it is imperative that more realistic scenarios are considered in this research to provide a more accurate and applicable analysis.
> 
> 1. Claim of Novelty and National-Level Analysis:
> The authors assert that their work is the first national-level analysis of the benefits of methane reduction actions that uniquely incorporates tipping points. However, the results section does not meet expectations. It lacks a detailed breakdown of national benefits, merely noting the number of countries experiencing either positive or negative benefits. There is a clear need for more in-depth analysis and discussion on the reasons behind these disparities, as the variation in outcomes across different countries is not adequately addressed.
> 2. Implications of Tipping Points:
> The paper does not sufficiently explore the implications of tipping points for specific countries. There is a critical question regarding whether considering tipping points exacerbates inequality between low-income and high-income countries. The authors should provide more insightful explanations and discussions on this issue.
> 3. Scenario Descriptions:
> The scenarios presented lack necessary details about how the 30% reduction by 2030 will be achieved and how this will extend into 2100. These descriptions should be included in the supplementary materials to help readers understand the basis of the cost estimates.
> 4. Uncertainty Analysis:
> The uncertainty analysis is currently weak. The paper only considers parameter uncertainty within the FaIR module, neglecting uncertainties from other modules and discount rates. A more comprehensive uncertainty analysis is needed to demonstrate the robustness of the social cost of CH4 results.
> 5. Comparison with SC-CO2:
> Please include a comparison between SC-CO2 and SC-CH4 in the discussion section to highlight the cost-effectiveness and importance of methane abatement measures. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss recent investments and the obstacles to methane mitigation.
> 6. Textual Logic and Clarity:
> The logical flow of the text should be improved. Some sentences are confusing and should be relocated to the methods or discussion sections, such as those in lines 276-289. Ensure the continuity and coherence of each paragraph throughout the paper.

> The manuscript titled “Large Economic Benefits of Global Methane Action” by Stoerk et al., evaluate the economic advantages of mitigating methane emissions through global action, particularly focusing on the Global Methane Pledge’s reduction target. The authors use a new Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) META, coupled with a simplified climate model FaIR, to quantify the potential cost of climate damages that can be reduced from methane abatement. They simulate different future scenarios by running their model under various future emission pathways. The results suggest substantial economic and environmental benefits from methane abatement. Overall, I think the results are interesting and could have important implications for global climate policies. However, there are some uncertainties in the calculation of the social cost of methane and limitations in the model’s representation of the global methane cycle—particularly the wetland methane feedback —which may impact the robustness of the conclusions.
> 
> I’m not a climate economist so I cannot provide comments on the originality or novelty of the economic aspects.
> 
> General comments:
> 
> - CH4 feedback mechanism. The authors consider tipping elements in their model but seem to overlook the natural wetland methane feedback, which occurred in the past warming events (Hopcroft et al., 2017) and could largely offset the committed reduction in anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the future scenarios (Zhang et al., 2023). The introduction briefly mentions this, but there is no discussion in the main text. Can the authors evaluate this feedback? Also, could the authors provide more details on how the methane cycle is modeled and clarify whether natural methane feedbacks are considered in the simulations?
> 
> - I like the section of quantifying the potential environmental benefits of methane abatement in lowering the risk of tipping points, but this does not seem to be directly linked to the economic benefits, which are the central focus of the manuscript. Furthermore, The probability of tipping points is dependent on how well the simplified climate model represents tipping-point mechanisms and their interactions. Further discussion on how these mechanisms affect economic outcomes is needed.
> 
> - The parameters used in the national damage calculations appear overly simplified. For instance, drought damage is treated as constant after a threshold, equating to 3.5% of GDP. A more realistic way is that it depends on the strength, duration, and location of the event. Also, the impact of droughts is highly heterogeneous. How does this simplification affect the country-level SC-CH4.
> 
> - The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed analysis and discussion of the relative priorities of CO₂ and CH₄ abatement, given methane’s short atmospheric lifetime. This is a key point of interest for the climate policy community. While the introduction touches on this issue, there is no follow-up discussion that addresses it.
> 
> - The social cost of methane is calculated based on national temperatures, but there is uncertainty in the process of disaggregating climate model outputs to finer spatial scales. Climate models typically estimate temperatures at coarse resolutions, which may not accurately capture conditions in smaller countries located within a single model grid cell. The influence of these uncertainties on cost estimates for small countries needs further clarification.
> 
> - Form and Structure. The manuscript currently does not fully align with the format in Nature. The abstract is somewhat lengthy, and the connection between climate tipping points and economic benefits is not clearly explained. Additionally, the main text includes too many plots, and the results section 1.1 includes excessive detail, which could be streamlined for better readability.

> I did not find this set of reviews very encouraging. Overall, I have the feeling that we did not 'connect' with the reviewers. Put it another way – I don't think they find the policy question very interesting. They are primarily interested in the model and its limitations. But this is not a methods paper, it does not pretend to be a big leap forward in terms of modelling, so if they don't find the policy question to be of first-order importance, then we are up against it. Also, we pretty clearly didn't get a draw of reviewers with much in common with us. R3 is very explicitly not a climate economist, R1's rather annoying review doesn't give the impression of any IAM expertise, and while R2 seems to have a bit more understanding of IAMs but still may not be in the literature estimating SC-GHGs. So, I think we got a bit unlucky with referees and we should reflect on our suggestions for next time. 
> 
> I'll pick out some of the more important comments just below, but obviously we face a more strategic question of whether to make edits and how substantial those edits should be before resubmitting. If we need reviewers to see this as a key policy question, maybe we should try Science (Policy Forum) next? The randomness of the review process, especially in multi-disciplinary science journals, suggests we should try all the other top ones before dropping down. But if we drop down we probably get less harshly judged on methodological contribution.
> 
> Comments:
> Two reviewers raise the issue of natural CH4 emissions from wetlands. Obviously we need a better discussion of this at minimum, which I hope Drew can help with. I don't know whether we need to enhance the model.
> We have this problem that as time passes climate targets set around the end of the 2010s look unrealistic, calling for new scenarios accounting appropriately for the wasted time between then and now. We might need to run some kind of modified policy scenario that accounts for this, not as our main policy scenario (the GMP), but as additional analysis.
> There are some comments about the limited scope of our uncertainty analysis. I don't think the reviewers fully understand what is being treated as uncertain and what is not (this is to be forgiven!), but we know of some parts of the model where we currently treat parameters as deterministic when in fact they should really be random variables (e.g., the pattern scaling coefficients as far as I recall). We have also consciously decided not to randomise the discount rate parameters and the damage persistence/mean reversion parameter, which we could revisit perhaps.
> R3 brings up the issue of comparing CH4 mitigation and CO2 mitigation. This resonates with a thought I have been harbouring for some time, namely that we leave this issue unexplored. For example, we show CH4 abatement is pro-poor, but I think this raises another question of whether it is more or less pro-poor than CO2 mitigation. It is not terribly surprising that GHG mitigation is pro-poor. The same goes for the risk reduction properties of CH4 versus CO2 mitigation. To my mind, the contribution of these sections of the paper would be enhanced by making the comparison, although I am not necessarily suggesting we do this before our next submission; we probably want a stronger signal of journal interest before doing lots more modelling.

Some valid points are raised though, and I think we might consider improving the explanation and analysis of a couple things before sending elsewhere. Just to note that I believe FaIR does include the GHG forcing due to ozone produced from methane.

> For 1, the reviewers seemed to want more on why the national level values look as they do. I expect this is simply a combination of economic output x vulnerability (stuff in harms way x risk of harm) and wouldn’t be directly related to population (as R1 mentions) and, more importantly, wouldn’t be directly related to methane specifically being the driver of climate change. That is, those nations with high methane-related damages would be the same that’d have high CO2-related damages. If so, perhaps we can just say that clearly.
>

> For 2, the above could be part of the response, but I agree with Simon’s comment here that there are interesting comparisons to be made such as relative ‘pro-poor’ strength as well as things like relative national level values. Again I agree with Simon that we don’t necessarily want to do a lot more modeling now, but perhaps a bit more comparison with existing results for SC-CO2 would help us to address at least some of these issues.

> So we have an idea of the range, which depends mostly on epidemiological uncertainties. These are mortality-based VSL estimates though, so not sure how one would incorporate this information to match what’s done for health impacts via temperature, etc. James and I have been working towards some of this in PAGE but not there yet. Note that I also have values at the national level if useful, and we have some morbidity data for things like hospitalization costs and asthma costs, but they’re quite small so not sure worth including.

> For 4, I’ve spent a fair amount of time looking into this, and the bottom line is that this is probably a very small effect. Roughly speaking, it takes a forcing of about 2.6 W/m2 to cause a degree of transient warming (which is I think the most relevant comparison for our purposes as we’re looking at a fast response and over the near-term, not millenia). The AR6 reported that methane emissions from wetlands are expected to increase as the Earth warms, leading to additional positive forcing of 0.03 ± 0.01 W m-2 °C-1 (mean ± 1 standard deviation) due to those emissions. They further note that the strength of this positive feedback is based upon limited evidence, with potentially much larger values of up to 0.16 W m-2 °C-1 (Gedney et al. 2019; Thornhill et al. 2021) based on models that also account for the effects of CO2 changes on productivity (Canadell et al. 2021). A recent (post-AR6) empirical estimate of methane’s feedback reported a value of 0.08 W m-2 °C-1 (Cheng & Redfern, 2022) that falls between those values. The strength of the methane/climate feedback can also be constrained using paleoclimate data. For example, the methane change during the transition between the last glacial maximum and the Holocene was a response to climate change. The feedback can be estimated based on the methane change of ~390 to 750 ppb over this time which accompanied a global mean warming of ~ 6°C (Gulev et al., 2021). That methane change leads to a direct forcing of 0.3 W m-2 which is increased by ~36% to 0.4 W m-2 when accounting for the chemical responses of ozone, stratospheric water vapor and CO2 responses to methane emissions (Szopa et al., 2021). The feedback in this case is thus 0.07 W m-2 °C-1, similar to the recent empirical value and larger than the central AR6 estimate though well within their quoted uncertainty range across their estimates. My point in all this is that if you take this full range of about 0.02 to 0.08 W/m2 per degree (leaving out the very high end value that includes CO2 changes, as those aren’t relevant to methane-driven impacts), that represents a positive feedback of about 1-3%, with the AR6 value at the low end but a long tail. That’s not a negligible value, but obviously a change in the SC-CH4 that added around 1-2% would be pretty minor. I’d think this wasn’t even worth including in the model given it’s likely so small, but this data would presumably be enough to add it if one wanted to. Note that the part of the response that is due to climate (likely most of it, though the effects of CO2 are even more uncertain than those of climate) so would be similar for any climate driver. In that sense, this is a very small compared with the uncertainty of other climate feedbacks such as clouds.

It sounds like something we should include in META-- at some point-- but it's not closely tied to our research question. We're using META because it's the best available model for methane-climate interaction, but we shouldn't claim that it has all methane feedback processes.

Without pollution effects, the main difference between CH4 and CO2 for their respective spatial SCs will be due to their residence time, and what that means for comparative inequality might depend a lot on how we measure it. But still, it's worth doing.

What the right scenario could be is not obvious to me, so my pragmatic suggestion would be to use the delta in 2050 consumption loss between the baseline scenario and the 1.5C scenario, since we already ran those.

If we find this to be the case, we should amend the manuscript by stating this clearly as recommended by Drew.

> The attached file contains the multi-model mean results for premature mortalities per Mt methane emissions. I used Mt rather than tonne as that makes the premature death numbers easier to deal with (otherwise they’ve very, very small). Costs are in millions of US$ so since those are per Mt the conversion to $/tonne is easy – the same value as in the file and just drop the ‘millions’ before US$. All values are in 2018 $US.

> There are several issues to keep in mind. One is that the epidemiological data for respiratory disease responses to ozone is more robust than that for cardiovascular diseases. Several large organization such as the US EPA and WHO therefore consider the respiratory deaths only in their analyses, though they acknowledge that there is suggestive evidence for cardiovascular responses as well and that they’re therefore making a quite conservative choice.
> 
>

> Next is that even for respiratory, some groups (EPA, Global Burden of Disease) still use an older exposure-response function than what we used. This I don’t feel is justified as the older one is from the American Cancer Society-II (ACS-II) cohort study, and the newer one is by the same team of researchers using an extended version of that same cohort (as it’s now run longer and so has more data). So to my mind, if you believe that’s a good study and those researchers do a good job of analyzing it, as implied by using their older results, why not update to a better version of that same work? So this is just really a FYI in case someone were to raise this.

> As for cardiovascular diseases, while as I noted the evidence base isn’t quite as strong, the results are clear in the ACS-II data meaning highly statistically significant. What’s less clear is primarily the biological causal pathway. We included this as there is also evidence that the ACS-II response is on the low side. New studies in China show a far larger cardiovascular response, for example, than that in the US data. So while one could argue that the cardiovascular results are not as robust as respiratory, one could also argue that this estimate is a conservative one.

> Finally, it’s worth noting that a recent paper (attached) looked at the social cost using the US government’s framework for the respiratory methane-driven ozone mortalities. They had a fairly similar number of mortalities, but a higher valuation ($1800/tonne vs our $1300/tonne). A small part of that is due to their use of a later year (2020 vs 2018) and a lower discount rate but it must also be due to slightly different assumptions in the modeling (e.g., baseline mortality rate projections). That might be useful to note in discussion.

> 
> Indeed I want us to look into this more, as I think the paper would be considerably stronger for being able to say something about how pro-poor CH4 abatement is relative to CO2 abatement. I see two ways to do this.
> 
> The first is as described by Thomas — look at total damages and compare CH4 abatement only with CO2+CH4 abatement (the delta in 2050 consumption loss between the baseline scenario and the 1.5C scenario). I think this could work. The disadvantage is that it is less clean than comparing CH4 abatement only with CO2 abatement only. But, we don't currently have a CO2 abatement scenario that doesn't have accompanying CH4 abatement. And such a scenario probably doesn't make sense conceptually anyway — we have argued you can vary CH4 abatement while holding CO2 abatement constant, but I don't think the argument goes the other way, as CO2 abatement will reduce CH4 (reduce fossil fuel extraction, distribution and use). So, we could argue that if the analysis is done on total costs, then this is the way you have to do it.
> 
> The second way is to remake the whole inequality analysis in terms of the distribution of marginal costs. This is less work than it sounds because we have many of the ingredients for that, we would just have to do the normalisation of national utility impacts by global mean GDP per capita rather than national GDP per capita, and then we would compare the distribution of the SC-CH4 to the distribution of the SC-CO2, and how each correlates with income. An advantage of this kind of analysis is that, as Drew has said, it may indirectly shed a bit more light on the fundamental drivers of the national SC distribution, which the Nature reviewers were interested in. Another advantage is that it might help people understand better what we are doing when we calculate national SC-CH4s normalising by national GDP per capita as well. So, in sum, this option has us featuring the marginal/social cost distribution a lot more in the paper, both as a means of exploring country incentives under non-cooperation as now but also as a means of analysing inequality.

> This is good, this is going to make the paper quite a bit stronger, although what it will do is make an amazing economic case for methane abatement even more amazing! We'll just have to see how to handle that rhetorically, because with negative abatement costs, we already have a bit the flavour that all our careful modelling of avoided climate damages doesn't matter a lot.

> 
> Hi Thomas, Drew, Simon,
> 
> Thank you all for the thoughtful insights and detailed feedback on the manuscript. I agree with the consensus that we should focus on strengthening the current paper with additional analyses and edits rather than undertaking new META modeling at this stage. Here's a summary of my views and contributions to the next steps:
> 
> **A1: Inequality Impacts of Mitigating CO2 vs CH4**
> I support exploring both avenues described by Simon to clarify the pro-poor nature of methane abatement. I lean towards using the delta in 2050 consumption loss between the baseline and the 1.5°C scenarios, as it efficiently leverages our existing analyses while offering meaningful insights.
> 
> **A2: Further Analyses into the National Distribution of SC-GHGs**
> I'm willing to take on the application of the Cobb-Douglas function to help explain the distribution of national SCCs. I'll coordinate with the necessary META outputs and share my findings for integration into the manuscript.
> 
> **A3: Add Air Quality Co-Benefits Channel**
> Drew, your previous work provides a robust foundation for integrating air quality benefits. Adding these as an external value will considerably enhance our paper. Please let me know if there are specific inputs or adjustments you'd need for this addition.
> 
> **E1: Wetland Forcing**
> I concur that incorporating a concise discussion on the negligible impact of wetland forcing, based on Drew's material, will address the reviewers' concerns effectively without overcomplicating our narrative.
