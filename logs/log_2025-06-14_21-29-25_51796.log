> Dear Dr. Rising, 
> My name is Muallimul Islam, and I am reaching out from Bangladesh. I am keenly interested in joining your research team at the University of Delaware as a graduate student.
> I recently read your research about how climate change affects fishery productivity by changing cross-boundary flows. Although I haven’t worked directly on this topic, my recent research in Bangladesh looked at how changes in temperature and salinity caused by climate change affect fish health and survival. We studied stress in local freshwater fish using tissue analysis, blood tests, and gene studies. We also tried using Spirulina and probiotics to help reduce these effects. This work made me very interested in how environmental changes affect fishery systems, especially how climate change changes fish numbers and where they live. I would love to learn more and take part in research that helps make fisheries stronger in a changing climate.  
> Please let me know if there are any available graduate studentships or research assistant positions in your lab, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss them with you.
> 
> I have attached my CV and academic transcripts for your review.. I would be delighted to discuss my research and am available for an interview whenever you have time.
> 
> Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of working with you.
