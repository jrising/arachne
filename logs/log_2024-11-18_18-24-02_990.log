> I'm looking for some new webcomics. For a long time, I've been a fan of XKCD, SMBC, OOTS, and Buttersafe. What should I try now?
**assistant**:
> Great to hear that you're looking to diversify your webcomic reading list. Given your interest in the humor and insight of XKCD, the eclectic hilarity of SMBC, the fantasy-driven narrative of OOTS, and the sweet absurdity in Buttersafe, I have a few suggestions that you may enjoy:
> 
> 1. **Dinosaur Comics**: This webcomic by Ryan North utilizes the same six panels in every comic, all featuring talking dinosaurs. Despite this limitation, the comic covers a vast array of topics from philosophy to superpowers, creating humor through its creative scripts.
> 
> 2. **The Perry Bible Fellowship**: Surreal and sometimes dark, but often hilarious, Nicholas Gurewitch's comic is a modern classic. The humor and art style vary wildly from comic to comic, bringing an element of surprise to each click.
> 
> 3. **Questionable Content**: Created by Jeph Jacques, this is a great slice-of-life comic with a cast of well-developed characters. With over 4000 strips, there's plenty to keep you entertained, and the blend of humor, drama and sci-fi elements may appeal to your diverse tastes.
> 
> 4. **Hark! A Vagrant**: Although no longer updating, Kate Beaton's historical and literarily-informed comic is sharp, witty, and often laugh-out-loud funny. If you enjoy the more academic humor of XKCD and SMBC, this could be a great addition.
> 
> Remember, humor is highly subjective, so feel free to check out the first few comics in these series to see if they resonate with you. Enjoy your new reading adventures!
