> I am processing 3-hourly data in a netcdf in python (xarray) to daily data. When I do `ds.groupby("time.date")`, I get a date coordinate, and then that fails when I try to write the result back out with to_netcdf(). How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> The `groupby` function in xarray tries to return a DataArray or Dataset grouped by a certain coordinate or dimension. When you're using `"time.date"`, you are creating a new group coordinate which is a date object, but this type can't be written into a netCDF file, because netCDF only supports numeric and text types.
> 
> Here is a way to perform this operation by rounding your time coordinate to 'daily' resolution:
> 
> 1. First, ensure your 'time' field is a datetime object.
> 
>     ```python
>     import xarray as xr
> 
>     ds = xr.open_dataset('inputfile.nc')
> 
>     # confirm the `time` dimension is a datatime64 object
>     print(ds.time.dtype)  
>     ```
> 
>     If not, convert this to a datetime64 object:
> 
>     ```python
>     ds['time'] = ds.indexes['time'].to_datetimeindex()
>     print(ds.time.dtype)  # should be 'datetime64[ns]'
>     ```
> 
> 2. Then, you can use the `resample` function to downsample the data to a daily frequency:
> 
>     ```python
>     daily_ds = ds.resample(time='1D').mean()
>     ```
> 
>     This creates a new dataset, `daily_ds`, where the original dataset has been resampled to a daily frequency using a mean function over each new daily period. You can replace `mean()` with `sum()`, `max()`, etc., depending on your specific use case.
> 
> 3. When you're satisfied with your data manipulations, you can then save your resampled Dataset:
> 
>     ```python
>     daily_ds.to_netcdf('outputfile.nc')
>     ```
> 
> The result is a netCDF file which contains your original data, resampled to daily frequency.
>   
> Please replace 'inputfile.nc' and 'outputfile.nc' with your actual file names. File paths can be added before the filenames if they are not in your current working directory.
