> My name is Jingwen Jiao, and I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Statistics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research in statistics, econometrics, network science and their applications in environmental economics and social sciences has strengthened my resolve to pursue further studies in climate change and climate modeling. I am writing to express my interest in the PhD program at the University of Delaware, particularly under your guidance.
> 
>  
> 
> During my time at UESTC, I consistently excelled academically, achieving a GPA of 3.8/4.0 and receiving multiple scholarships, including the National Scholarship for Postgraduate Students. My active engagement in research led to contributions as a first author in high-impact journals such as "Energy" (Q1, Impact Factor: 9.0) and "Journal of Statistics and Decision Making" and one paper is currently under review at "Nature Human Behaviour". In these projects, I employed econometrics, causal inference, statistical machine learning and complex network analysis to explore topics such as the transmission mechanisms of geopolitical risks to the oil market and the impact of scientific awards on citation networks.
> 
>  
> 
> Beyond my individual research, I have collaborated on interdisciplinary projects that broadened my perspective and skills. For instance, collaborating with Prof. Santo Fortunato from Indiana University, Bloomington, and Prof. Yifang Ma from the Southern University of Science and Technology on " Ripple Effects of Prizewinning in Science" project, I utilized econometrics and data science to uncover the exponential nature of the ripple chain in collaboration networks. Recently, I am working as a research assistant with Prof. Junjie Zhang at Duke University, where I construct a county-level climate risk index, investigating the spillover effects of climate risk on supply-chain networks and measuring the vulnerability of the bank system to climate risk. These experiences underscore my deep passion for research and my ability to tackle complex problems through innovative and interdisciplinary approaches. I am committed to advancing the purpose of research and making meaningful contributions to my field.
> 
>  
> 
> I am particularly interested in your research in climate change and climate modeling, as it aligns closely with my previous experiences and research interests. Your papers on this topic have deeply inspired me, and I am motivated to further my studies in this field. I believe I am an excellent fit for your PhD program for several reasons. I have mastered complex statistical modeling methods and successfully applied them in interdisciplinary contexts. My strong statistical background and interdisciplinary research experience have honed my analytical skills and enhanced my ability to contribute effectively. Also, I possess a strong theoretical foundation in statistics and econometrics, and I am proficient in using data analysis tools such as R, Python, Stata, and GIS. Additionally, I have passed professional qualifications including FRM, CFA, and ACCA, providing me with comprehensive knowledge in finance and economics. These skills and experiences have equipped me to conduct high-level academic research independently.

> Under your mentorship, I am confident in further developing my research skills and making significant contributions to this field. Additionally, I am open to seeking online collaboration with you in advance to build a productive research relationship before the PhD program begins.

> Based on Jingwen Jiao's email, here are the specific points and questions she raised:
> 
> 1. Jingwen is interested in pursuing a PhD at the University of Delaware, specifically under your supervision, focusing on climate change and climate modeling.
> 2. She has a strong background in statistics, econometrics, and interdisciplinary research, with impressive academic achievements and contributions to high-impact journals.
> 3. Jingwen is currently involved in research addressing climate risk, which aligns with your research interests.
> 4. She expresses a desire to collaborate with you in advance of potentially joining the PhD program.
> 
> Given her background, it seems she would be a strong candidate for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics, considering her quantitative skills and alignment with your research interests. However, it's also worth noting that she is not local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, and she doesn’t mention any connections with the listed universities (MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD).

> Dear Jingwen,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your impressive academic background and research experiences. Your work in statistics, econometrics, and climate risk is highly relevant and aligns well with my research in climate change and climate modeling.
> 
> We have recently introduced a new system to assist prospective students in identifying the best academic programs for their interests and backgrounds. I encourage you to fill out the form here: [https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7](https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7). This will help us determine the best fit for your skills and research goals within our graduate programs.
> 
> If you are considering our Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics, please note that it is the preferred program for prospective students with strong quantitative skills like yours. However, funding is limited, so it is important to apply by December 1 for full consideration. Mentioning my name in your statement of purpose would indicate your interest in my supervision.
> 
> I look forward to learning more about your research aspirations through the form. Thank you again for your interest in our program.
