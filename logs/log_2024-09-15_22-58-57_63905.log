> I want to ask them a multiple choice question that checks that they have done the reading, and I want it to focus on the discussion of a "trim tab". Can you provide me with some suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are some multiple-choice questions focusing on the "trim tab" concept from the reading:
> 
> 1. **What is a "trim tab" as used in the reading, and what does it illustrate about systems thinking?**
>    * A: A decorative element on a boat, illustrating aesthetics in design.
>    * B: A small rudder on the main rudder of a ship, illustrating how small, focused actions can lead to significant changes.
>    * C: A measuring device for fuel efficiency, illustrating the importance of metrics in systems.
>    * D: A safety feature on airplanes, illustrating risk management.
> 
> 2. **Why does Buckminster Fuller use the "trim tab" as a metaphor in systems thinking?**
>    * A: To emphasize the importance of incremental effort in achieving change.
>    * B: To show how large systems cannot be influenced by minor changes.
>    * C: To demonstrate how small, non-obvious actions can have a big impact when applied correctly.
>    * D: To highlight the redundancy present in complex systems.
> 
> 3. **According to the reading, how does a trim tab help illustrate the concept of leverage in systems?**
>    * A: It is an example of how redundancy in systems reduces effectiveness.
>    * B: It shows that large problems always require large solutions.
>    * C: It exemplifies that small adjustments can facilitate larger changes by making it easier to turn the rudder.
>    * D: It demonstrates the difficulty of changing direction in large systems.
> 
> 4. **How does the function of a trim tab relate to finding high-leverage points in systems?**
>    * A: Trim tabs make the system more rigid and less responsive to change.
>    * B: They represent obvious areas of intervention because they are visible.
>    * C: They show that less noticeable components can greatly enhance system performance when used judiciously.
>    * D: They signify the futility of making changes in such large systems.
> 
> These questions should help ensure your students focus on the concept of leverage as illustrated by the trim tab metaphor in the context of systems thinking.
