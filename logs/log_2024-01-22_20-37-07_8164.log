**user**:
> I am preparing a grant proposal on the consequences of climate change on food security, and from food security to health (e.g., wasting). I have separate sections describing the background on food insecurity, climate change on food production, and the vulnerability of small-holders. What should I include in my section on "Consequences of Malnutrition on Health".
**assistant**:
> The "Consequences of Malnutrition on Health" is a critical section for your grant proposal, James. It needs to capture the gravity of the problem and the ripple effect on health. Here's a structure you might consider:
> 
> ### Consequences of Malnutrition on Health
> 
> **1. Overview**: Begin with a concise statement on the global prevalence of malnutrition and its relation to food insecurity and climate change. Establish that malnutrition impacts health on notable scales, from individuals to populations.
> 
> **2. Forms of Malnutrition**: Elucidate types of malnutrition, primarily undernutrition (including wasting, stunting, underweight), micronutrient-related malnutrition (including micronutrient deficiency or 'hidden hunger', and micronutrient excess), and overnutrition (including overweight and obesity).
> 
> **3. Impact on Body Systems**: Discuss how malnutrition disturbs various body systems on immediate and long-term scales. For instance, undernutrition can lead to impaired immune response, lower IQ in children, and even cause death. Overnutrition can lead to non-communicable diseases like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.
> 
> **4. Impact on Population Health**: Introduce macro-level consequences, such as the links between mass malnutrition and wider society health indicators. For instance, the increased vulnerability of malnourished populations to pandemics or endemic diseases. 
> 
> **5. Vulnerable Groups**: Dissect the effects of malnutrition on specific groups like children, pregnant women, aging populations, and those with pre-existing health conditions. 
> 
> **6. Socio-Economic Consequences**: Mention the socio-economic consequences of health degradation due to malnutrition, such as the increase in healthcare costs, decrease in productivity, and effects on economic development.
> 
> **7. Climate Change's Role**: Reiterate the connection to your earlier sections, focusing on how climate change-induced food insecurity can exacerbate the situation, contributing to more prevalence of malnutrition and subsequent health issues.
> 
> Remember that adding graphs, maps, or other visuals can help communicate complex data. A synthesis table recapping different malnutrition forms, related health concerns, vulnerable groups, and climate influence can be very useful, too. Be sure to use recent, high-impact references to bolster your arguments. 
> 
> This will not only make it more compelling and accessible but also underscore the urgency and importance of your research.
