> To look for mountable drives on Ubuntu, you can use a variety of command-line tools and utilities. Here are some common methods:
> 
> 1. **Using `lsblk` Command**:
>    ```bash
>    lsblk
>    ```
>    This will display information about all available block devices.
> 
> 2. **Using `fdisk` Command**:
>    ```bash
>    sudo fdisk -l
>    ```
>    This lists all available disks and their partitions.
> 
> 3. **Using `blkid` Command**:
>    ```bash
>    sudo blkid
>    ```
>    This provides details about available block devices and their UUIDs.
> 
> 4. **Using `df` Command**:
>    ```bash
>    df -h
>    ```
>    This shows disk space usage for mounted filesystems.
> 
> 5. **Using `cat /proc/partitions`**:
>    ```bash
>    cat /proc/partitions
>    ```
>    This shows all partitions recognized by the system.
> 
> 6. **Using GParted**:
>    If you prefer a graphical interface:
>    ```bash
>    sudo apt-get install gparted
>    sudo gparted
>    ```
>    This is a powerful partition manager.
