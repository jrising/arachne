**user**:
> At some point, I set up a proxy or something, where when I go to Nature.com, it tries to go first to udel.idm.oclc.org. But this domain no longer works-- it refused to connect. How can I remove this in my browser?
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you've previously set up a bypass or a custom proxy to access Nature.com, possibly through the University of Delaware's proxy service. This setup might have been configured directly in your browser settings or through an extension.
> 
> Here’s how you can troubleshoot and remove the proxy settings for a few common scenarios:
> 
> ### 1. Browser Proxy Settings
> 
> #### Google Chrome
> 1. Open Chrome and go to `Settings`.
> 2. Scroll down to `Advanced` and click on it to expand more options.
> 3. Under the `System` section, click on `Open your computer’s proxy settings`.
> 4. Depending on your operating system:
>    - **Windows**: In the `Proxy` tab, turn off `Use a proxy server`.
>    - **MacOS**: Uncheck any proxies that are checked under the `Select a protocol to configure` list.
> 5. Save the changes and restart your browser.
> 
> #### Mozilla Firefox
> 1. Open Firefox and click on the menu button (☰) in the upper-right corner.
> 2. Go to `Settings` (or `Preferences` on Mac).
> 3. Scroll down to the `Network Settings` section and click on `Settings...`.
> 4. Check `No proxy` or manually remove any proxy settings if configured.
> 5. Save the changes and restart Firefox.
> 
> ### 2. Browser Extensions
> 1. Check for any extensions related to proxies or VPNs that might be redirecting your connection.
> 2. Open your browser’s extension or add-on manager:
>    - **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions/`
>    - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
> 3. Disable any extensions that might relate to proxy settings and test the connection again.
> 
> ### 3. Hosts File (Advanced)
> If manually configured, check if the redirection was set in your system’s hosts file, though this is less common:
> - **Windows**: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
> - **MacOS/Linux**: /etc/hosts
> 
> Open the hosts file using a text editor and remove any lines associated with the redirect, then save the file.
> 
> After trying these steps, check your browser by visiting Nature.com directly to see if the issue has been resolved. Let me know if you need further assistance!
**user**:
> It's not in my system's proxy settings, because it only happens in one browser. It's not an extension and it's not in /etc/hosts.
**assistant**:
> If the issue is limited to one browser and isn’t related to proxy settings, extensions, or the hosts file, it could be a per-site setting, cached data, or a custom configuration in that browser. Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot:
> 
> ### 1. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies
> Clearing cached data may resolve redirection issues if outdated data is causing the problem.
> 
> - **Google Chrome**
>   1. Go to `Settings` > `Privacy and security` > `Clear browsing data`.
>   2. Select `Cookies and other site data` and `Cached images and files`.
>   3. Click `Clear data`.
> 
> - **Mozilla Firefox**
>   1. Go to `Settings` > `Privacy & Security`.
>   2. Scroll to `Cookies and Site Data` and click `Manage Data…`.
>   3. Search for `nature.com`, remove it if it exists, and then clear cached data.
> 
> ### 2. Check Site-Specific Permissions
> Sometimes, specific permissions for websites can affect access.
> 
> - **Google Chrome**
>   1. Visit Nature.com.
>   2. Click on the padlock icon in the address bar.
>   3. Go to `Site settings` and reset permissions for that site.
> 
> - **Mozilla Firefox**
>   1. Visit Nature.com.
>   2. Click on the padlock icon in the address bar.
>   3. Click on `Clear Cookies and Site Data…` or adjust permissions as needed.
> 
> ### 3. Reset Browser Settings
> Resetting the browser can resolve persistent issues and restore defaults.
> 
> - **Google Chrome**
>   1. Go to `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Reset and clean up`.
>   2. Select `Restore settings to their original defaults` and confirm.
> 
> - **Mozilla Firefox**
>   1. Go to `Help` (☰) > `More Troubleshooting Information`.
>   2. Click on `Refresh Firefox` and confirm.
> 
> ### 4. Check for Any Custom URL Redirects
> Sometimes, configurations can cause one specific URL to redirect:
> 
> 1. In Chrome, you can check settings by navigating to `chrome://settings/` and checking for any redirects.
> 2. In Firefox, check if any settings are affecting redirection under `about:config` (search for "redirect").
> 
> After performing these steps, try visiting Nature.com again. Let me know if the issue persists!
