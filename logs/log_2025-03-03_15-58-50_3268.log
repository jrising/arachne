> Is there a way to find out which columns of a given dgCMatrix row are non-zero efficiently? Perhaps I can convert the whole matrix first to a different non-dense matrix format to get the information out more easily. I don't want to get out the rows themselves because then I get a dense vector.

> Yes, you can efficiently find the non-zero columns of a given row in a `dgCMatrix` (which is a sparse matrix class in the Matrix package in R) without converting the entire matrix format. A `dgCMatrix` is stored in a column-compressed format, which means each column is stored along with the indices of its non-zero entries and corresponding values. Here's a method to extract the non-zero columns of a specific row:

> This method lists column indices directly, avoiding the creation of a dense vector. Note that R uses 1-based indexing, so make sure the row index corresponds to this convention. Let me know if there's anything else you need!
