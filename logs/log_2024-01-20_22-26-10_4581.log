> I'm trying to install Copernicus's CDS API. They say to do `pip install cdsapi`. I've done that, and it says it was successful (`Requirement already satisfied: cdsapi in /home/jrising/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages (0.6.1)`). But when I do `import cdsapi`, it says 
> Traceback (most recent call last):

> Here are some common solutions when facing such issues:
> 
> 1. **Wrong Python Version/Environment**: It's possible you're using a different Python environment or version than the one in which you installed the package. This is especially likely if you have more than one version of Python installed, or if you use virtual environments.
> 
>     **Solution**: Ensure you are using the same version of Python in which you installed the `cdsapi` package. You can print the Python version like this:
>     ```
>     import sys
>     print(sys.version)
>     ```
> 
>     If you are working within a virtual environment, ensure you've activated the correct environment.
> 
> 2. **Run pip with the Python Command**: It may help to ensure you're installing the `cdsapi` package for the correct Python interpreter.
> 
>     **Solution**: Install your package with Python interpreter directly:
>     ```
>     python3.10 -m pip install cdsapi
>     ```
> 
> 3. **['PYTHONPATH' Environment Variable](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH)**: If the Python interpreter can't find `cdsapi`, it may be that your 'PYTHONPATH' environment variable doesn't include the directory where this module resides.
> 
>     **Solution**: You could add this directory to the 'PYTHONPATH' environment variable. But it's generally better to install Python modules in locations that Python checks by default, or to use `pip` options that set up paths correctly, especially if you're less familiar with Python's import system and 'PYTHONPATH'.
> 
> Please do these checks and let's see what we uncover!
