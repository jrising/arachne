> Dear James Rising,
> 
> My name is Daniel Ozoemena and I’m a graduate of Agricultural Extension from the Federal University of Technology Owerri Nigeria, where I carried out my bachelor’s thesis in Agribusiness. I graduated with a 3.99 CGPA on a 5.00 Grading scale, which is equivalent to a 3.19 CGPA on a 4.00 Grading scale. I’m from Nigeria where our Official Language is English Language. 
> 
> My bachelor’s thesis was in “Agribusiness and its role in reducing poverty”. I find a connection between my bachelor’s thesis and a particular research area you are interested in ‘ Impacts of climate change bringing together empirical estimates and integrated assessment models; Modeling of social-environmental systems focusing on complex systems, food  and fisheries, and resource management’. I believe there are roles played by climate change that affect agribusinesses and economic development. I would be delighted to build upon my masters experience in “Environmental science and management” with you as I expand my research into related areas.
> 
> I have been advised to look for a Graduate Research Supervisor before submitting my application, as it gives me edge over other applicants. And hopefully I can secure a graduate assistantship/scholarship with your support. I am hoping there’s still space for application to come in.
> 
> I would be honored to work under your supervision. Below i have attached my academic CV and other necessary documents for perusal and I would appreciate your response to know my fate

> Dear James,
> 
> Thank you for forwarding me the email for analysis. Based on my assessment, Daniel Ozoemena seems to be primarily interested in the **Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)** program. He mentioned his desire to expand into "related areas" stemming from his bachelor's background dealing with agribusiness. He sees a connection between his past work and your research focusing on the impacts of climate change, complex systems, and food and fisheries, which succinctly aligns with the ESM curriculum.
> 
> Due to his nomenclature of "CGPA", he appears to be internationally schooled but English is the official language in his country, which means reference to local universities in your requested list is non-applicable.
> 
> His request for a potential graduate assistantship/scholarship indicates interest in financial aid, signaling the importance of making clear the funding limitations for this program.
> 
> The questions I've identified from his email are:
> - Is there still space for application?
> - Would it be possible for him to work under your supervision?
> - Could he secure a graduate assistantship/scholarship with your support?
> 
> Based on this, I propose the following response:

> Dear Daniel,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your background in agribusiness and interest in the environmental impacts of climate change align well with our Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program. This program has recently turned more exciting with a new Marine track – something you might find interesting to explore.
> 
> However, funding is always a limiting factor in our ability to accept students – most students in the ESM program are unfunded. If you're able to seek out funding from other sources (like scholarships, grants, or assistantships outside our department) this will greatly strengthen your application.
> 
> Concerning your inquiries about application deadlines and availability within the program, I recommend reaching out to the program administration directly to ensure the most accurate and timely information.
> 
> Finally, when you apply, I encourage you to mention my name in your statement of purposes indicating your interest in my research areas. That could certainly bolster your standing in the selection process.
> 
> I urge you to apply by December 15 so that your application can be considered for any available school funds.
