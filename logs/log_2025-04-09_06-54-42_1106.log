It notes familiar issues like disaster risk management while introducing novel challenges, such as ensuring decarbonization efforts are not hindered by climate impacts and addressing equity and resilience in vulnerable communities. Growing importance is given to natural capital's role in resilience and the still-emerging concept of adaptation for MoFs. The report adopts the UNFCCC definition of adaptation. It outlines three steps for MoFs: identifying climate risks and impacts, assessing solutions, and understanding the interplay of these factors in macroeconomic planning. Specific questions are provided to guide MoFs in quantifying risks and finding effective adaptation measures.

Notably, it highlights the greater concern among Emerging Market and Developing Economies compared to Advanced Economies about macroeconomic climate implications. The survey reveals that while many MoFs participate in national climate strategies, fewer are involved in adaptation and resilience planning. The data also shows limited progress in the integration of climate considerations into public financial management and analytical tools. Only a minor segment of MoFs has conducted detailed analyses on fiscal needs for climate adaptation and resilience.

> Page 18 discusses how Ministries of Finance have incorporated climate considerations into economic analysis and decision-making, noting that progress is varied. The page reveals that few ministries have fully integrated climate impacts into their core functions like policy appraisal, financial sector policies, and macroeconomic forecasting. Budget projections see some progress, with about 35% of countries incorporating climate factors at some level. However, the integration of climate concerns into fiscal and tax measures remains limited. The text underscores gaps in using dedicated climate-economy models and highlights varying methods and model limitations. Many ministries are still in early stages of analyzing fiscal needs for adaptation, with around 44% not having conducted such analyses and 16% being unsure about their status.

> Page 21 explores the economic implications of climate change on public finance, particularly highlighting the pressures extreme weather events place on government budgets through both explicit and implicit contingent liabilities. It emphasizes how such events, like floods and droughts, can increase public debt, damage sovereign assets, and negatively affect credit ratings. These physical risks also impact public health and social structures, leading to additional public expenditure and reduced tax revenues. The text argues that climate change can exacerbate fiscal challenges due to its non-linear relationship with GDP, which becomes more costly with higher temperatures. The complexities of integrating physical science insights into economic impact assessments are acknowledged, with varied methodologies leading to differing results.

It uses vertical columns to represent different risks and the temperature at which they occur, segmented into color bands to indicate varying levels of risk. The key risks are grouped into four categories:

>    - **Human heat stress, mortality and morbidity:** Risk escalates from moderate (yellow) to high (red) and very high (purple) as temperature increases.
> 
> 2. **Key Risk 2:**
>    - **Marine ecosystems disruptions**
>    - **Terrestrial ecosystems disruptions**
>    - **Losses in crop production:** Each shows a similar pattern of increasing risk with rising temperatures.
> 
> 3. **Key Risk 3:**
>    - **Water scarcity in Southern Europe (SEU)**
>    - **Water scarcity in Western and Central Europe (WCE)**
>    - **River and pluvial flooding:** These risks also follow the ember color gradient of moderate to very high risk with temperature rise.
> 
> 4. **Key Risk 4:**
>    - **Coastal flooding**
>    - **Delayed risks for cultural heritage and long-living infrastructure:** Again, increasing levels of risk are depicted as temperatures rise.

> The levels of risk are represented by colors: yellow for moderate, red for high, and purple for very high. Confidence in these predictions is shown by black dots, ranging from low to high confidence. There is a background shading indicating temperature increases and their impact on risks. The chart emphasizes the rising danger to society and ecosystems as global temperatures rise, offering a visual representation of potential future impacts.
