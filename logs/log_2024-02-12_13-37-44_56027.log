**user**:
> I tried to hang up a heavy shelf on my drywall wall. I used drywall anchors, but when the whole thing came crashing down, it became clear that these anchors just made equally-large holes in the wall and that the ridges on them didn't actually anchor into the drywall. Is there anyway to use the anchor-holes to put up the shelf?
**assistant**:
> Sorry to hear about your shelf. Once a hole has been made too large for its intended anchor in drywall, the initial anchor usually can't be used in the same hole again effectively. Drywall anchors rely on the tension between the wall and the anchor to hold weight. If the hole becomes too large, that tension is lost.
> 
> Should you wish to reuse the same holes, you have a few options:
> 
> 1. **Larger Anchors**: Buy larger anchors that can fit the now-bigger holes, re-drill, and install (or use toggle bolts, which can hold more weight).
> 
> 2. **Fill and Redo**: Fill the holes with a substance like joint compound or a repair patch, let it dry, then re-drill and install new anchors. This process is more work and requires painting over the filled hole to match your wall.
> 
> 3. **Locate a Stud**: Ideally, heavy items should be mounted in wall studs. Use a stud finder to determine if there's a stud you can drill directly into. If the holes aren't too far apart, this may be viable with the existing anchor holes.
> 
> 4. **Stabilizing Plate**: Finally, if the holes are close together, consider using a broader stabilizing plate or board. Attach this plate to the wall securely (ideally at multiple, perhaps new, points, or using a stud), then attach the shelf to the plate. It helps distribute the load over a larger area of the wall.

> For future reference, make sure to pick the correct drywall anchor for the weight of your object. If you're uncertain, it's better to overestimate the weight. Also, consider using a different kind of anchor like a toggle bolt for heavier objects.
