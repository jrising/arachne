> I have a few slides in a Beamer prezentation that show the same rows (sectors of a climate risk estimate) but different columns (the first shows information on adaptation, the second on valuation, etc.). I want three slides to show up with a consistent spacing, so the rows the same height and place on the slide, even though they have different amounts of text. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> Ensuring consistent row height across multiple Beamer slides can be a bit tricky, especially if the amount of text varies. A good approach is to use the `tabular` environment with fixed row heights. This can be achieved with the help of `array` package to specify a fixed height for each row.
> 
> Here is a complete example that demonstrates how to achieve this:
> 
> 1. Load the necessary packages in your Beamer document.
> 2. Define a fixed height for rows using the `\arraystretch` command.
> 3. Use the `tabular` environment with a specified fixed height to ensure consistency across slides.

> Below is a minimal working example:
> 
> ```latex
> \documentclass{beamer}
> \usepackage{array}
> \usepackage{multicol}
> 
> % Set the row height
> \newcolumntype{P}[1]{>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{#1}}
> \setlength{\extrarowheight}{4pt} % Adjust this to control row spacing
> 
> % Row height definition with fixed height
> \newcommand{\rowheight}{\rule{0pt}{3ex}}

> ### Summary:
> 1. **Packages**: Use `array` and `multicol` for enhanced table formatting.
> 2. **Row height control**: Use `\extrarowheight` and a custom `\rowheight` command to ensure consistent row height.
> 3. **Consistent formatting**: Define a `P{width}` column type to ensure uniform column widths.
> 
> This setup ensures that, despite the varying text length across different columns, the row heights and overall layout remain consistent across multiple slides. Adjust the values of `\extrarowheight` and `rowheight` based on your specific formatting needs.
