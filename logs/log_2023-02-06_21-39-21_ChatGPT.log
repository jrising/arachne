> How much faster is a GPU at performing a dot-product than a CPU?
**assistant**:
> It is difficult to give a specific answer without knowing the specifics of the GPU and CPU in question, as the performance difference can vary greatly depending on the hardware specifications and implementation details. However, in general, GPUs are optimized for parallel processing and are significantly faster at performing matrix operations such as dot products compared to a CPU. The performance gain can range from several times to hundreds of times faster.
