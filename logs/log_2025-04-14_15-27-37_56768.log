> Is there a way to send a zoom link calendar invitation using Google's Schedule Send?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use Google's Schedule Send feature to send calendar invites that include Zoom links. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. **Create the Zoom Meeting:**
>    - Schedule your Zoom meeting in the Zoom application or website.
>    - Once scheduled, you will receive a Zoom meeting link.
> 
> 2. **Add the Zoom Link to Google Calendar:**
>    - Open Google Calendar and create a new event.
>    - Enter the event details like the meeting name, date, and time.
>    - In the 'Location' or 'Description' field, paste the Zoom link.
>    - Save the event to add it to your calendar.
> 
> 3. **Schedule Send the Invitation:**
>    - Go to your email and compose a new message.
>    - Add the recipient(s) you want to invite to the calendar event.
>    - In the message body, you can include any additional details or instructions if necessary.
>    - Instead of sending the email right away, click on the arrow next to the "Send" button, and select "Schedule send."
>    - Choose the date and time you wish to send the invitation.
> 
> By following these steps, you can ensure that your Zoom link is part of a calendar invitation that is sent at a scheduled time via Gmail. This allows you to plan your communication in advance and coordinate with your invitees more effectively.
**user**:
> But how will the calendar invite be sent with the email?
**assistant**:
> To send a calendar invite along with an email when using Google Calendar and Gmail, you can follow these steps:
> 
> ### Step 1: Create the Event in Google Calendar
> 1. **Open Google Calendar**:
>    - Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
> 
> 2. **Create a New Event**:
>    - Click the "+ Create" button or select a time slot on the calendar.
>    - Fill in the event details, including the meeting name, date, time, and any other specifics.
> 
> 3. **Add Zoom Link**:
>    - In the "Description" or "Location" field, paste your Zoom meeting link.
> 
> 4. **Add Guests**:
>    - In the "Add guests" section, enter the email addresses of everyone you want to invite.
>    - Ensure that "Guests can invite others" is checked if you want them to have that option.
> 
> 5. **Save the Event**:
>    - Click "Save" and choose to send invites to guests when prompted.
> 
> ### Step 2: Use Schedule Send in Gmail (Optional)
> If you want to include a personalized message in an email and schedule it to send at a specific time (but the invite will already be sent through Google Calendar as described above):
> 
> 1. **Compose a New Email**:
>    - Open Gmail and click on "Compose."
> 
> 2. **Write Your Message**:
>    - Include any details, reiterating the meeting time and purpose, and why the recipients should join.
> 
> 3. **Schedule Send**:
>    - Click the dropdown arrow next to the "Send" button and select "Schedule send."
>    - Choose when you want to send the email.
> 
> ### Important Note
> - When you create an event and add guests through Google Calendar, the invitees receive a calendar invite directly, which includes the event details and Zoom link. The email you send through Gmail is additional and can serve as a reminder or provide context. 
> 
> This combination ensures that everyone is aware of the meeting details and has the Zoom link readily available.
**user**:
> But that's exactly what I don't want-- this will send the invite immediately, rather than at a scheduled future time.
**assistant**:
> Got it! If you want to schedule a Google Calendar invite to send at a future date and time **without sending it immediately**, you can follow this workaround:
> 
> ### Steps to Schedule a Google Calendar Invite to Send Later
> 
> 1. **Create the Event in Google Calendar (without sending invites immediately):**
>    - Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
>    - Click on "+ Create" to create a new event.
>    - Fill in the event details like title, date, time, and paste your Zoom link in the description or location field.
>    - **IMPORTANT:** Do not add any guests at this point.
>    - Save the event.
> 
> 2. **Email the Calendar Invite Later:**
>    - After saving your event, go back to the event in Google Calendar, click on it, and select the "Edit" option (pencil icon).
>    - Now add your guests in the "Add guests" section.
>    - **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT click "Save" yet.
>    - Instead, open Gmail and compose a message with the details of the meeting (including the Zoom link).
>    - Schedule this email using the "Schedule send" option, choosing when you want the email to go out.
> 
> 3. **Send the Calendar Invite:**
>    - After your scheduled email is set, go back to the Google Calendar event (still in edit mode) and now click "Save" and confirm that you want to send invites. 
> 
> ### Summary
> - The email with the meeting details will be sent at the scheduled time.
> - The calendar invite will be sent when you hit "Save" in Google Calendar, which can be done separately before or after scheduling your email.
> 
> This way, the invitees will receive the calendar invitation when you choose, rather than immediately. However, if you want the calendar invite to go out at the same time as your scheduled email, you'll need to manage the timing closely. 
> 
> If Google Calendar doesn't provide the desired functionality for your needs, keep an eye out for third-party calendar tools or extensions that may offer more specific scheduling capabilities in the future.
**user**:
> But I figured that the google calendar invite option just sent emails with the calendar event as an attachment. I can't reproduce the same effect that way?
**assistant**:
> You’re correct that when you create an event in Google Calendar and add guests, it sends them a calendar invite via email, which contains the event details and can show up in their calendars. However, scheduling that specific event invitation via Gmail isn’t directly supported. 
> 
> That said, you can replicate this process and ensure your email contains the invite link by following these steps:
> 
> ### Step 1: Schedule the Zoom Meeting
> 1. **Create the Zoom Meeting**:
>    - Set up your Zoom meeting and copy the meeting link.
> 
> ### Step 2: Create a Calendar Event
> 1. **Open Google Calendar**:
>    - Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
>   
> 2. **Create a New Event**:
>    - Click on "+ Create".
>    - Enter the meeting details.
>    - Paste the Zoom link into the event's description.
> 
> 3. **Do Not Add Guests Yet**:
>    - Save the event without adding guests. This prevents any automatic invites from being sent.
> 
> ### Step 3: Prepare the Email with the Calendar Invite
> For the seasonal invite attachment:
> 
> 1. **Compose an Email in Gmail**:
>    - Open Gmail and click "Compose".
>    - In your email, include the details about the meeting (date, time, Zoom link, etc.).
>   
> 2. **Attach the Calendar Event**:
>    - Instead of adding an attachment manually, you can indicate in your email that your guests will receive a separate calendar invite shortly. You might want to include a reminder to check their calendar.
> 
> ### Step 4: Schedule the Email
> 1. **Schedule Send**:
>    - Click the dropdown next to the "Send" button and choose "Schedule send".
>    - Pick the time you want this email to go out.
> 
> ### Step 5: Later, Add Guests to the Calendar Event
> 1. **Go Back to the Calendar Event**:
>    - When you're ready to send the invite, edit your event again in Google Calendar.
>    - Add your guests in the "Add guests" section.
>    - Click "Save", and when prompted, choose to send invites.
> 
> ### Summary
> Although you can’t attach the calendar event itself via Gmail’s scheduling, this method allows you to send an information email with the Zoom link while ensuring that your official calendar invites go out separately at your desired time. The guests will get two communications: your scheduled email and the Google Calendar invitation later on. 
> 
> If you’re looking for a more integrated solution, consider third-party tools like scheduling apps that might combine both functionalities.
