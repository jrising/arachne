**assistant**:
> You can shift the axes of a raster from the range `-180 to 180` to `0 to 360` in several ways depending on the programming language you're using. Here's an example of how you could do it in R using the `raster` package:
> 
> ```r
> library(raster)
> 
> # Load raster
> r <- raster("<your_raster_file>")
> 
> # Shift raster
> r_shifted <- shift(r, x = 180)
> 
> # Update extent of the raster
> res <- res(r_shifted)
> e <- extent(r_shifted)
> e@xmin <- 0
> e@xmax <- 360
> extent(r_shifted) <- e
> 
> # Now, your raster's axes should be from 0 to 360
> ```
> 
> Remember to adjust `"<your_raster_file>"` to the path to your raster file. This code reads the raster, shifts it horizontally by 180 degrees, and then adjusts the extent to be between 0 and 360.
> 
> In Python, using `rasterio` and `numpy`, you can do the following:
> 
> ```python
> import rasterio
> import numpy as np
> 
> # Load raster
> with rasterio.open("<your_raster_file>") as src:
>     ras_array = src.read()
>     transform = src.transform
> 
> # Shift raster
> ras_array_shifted = np.roll(ras_array, ras_array.shape[1] // 2, axis=1)
> 
> # Update the metadata
> metadata = src.meta
> metadata['transform'] = rasterio.Affine(transform[0], transform[1], transform[2] + 180,
>                                         transform[3], transform[4], transform[5])
> 
> # Write the result to a new file
> with rasterio.open("<output_raster_file>", "w", **metadata) as dest:
>     dest.write(ras_array_shifted)
> ```
> This code reads the raster to a numpy array, rolls it horizontally, and writes it back to a new raster file with updated transform in the metadata.
> 
> Please be aware that shifting a global raster like this might introduce inaccuracies at the dateline (180 degrees). So, depending on your application, it may be better to work with coordinates from -180 to 180 instead of shifting them.
