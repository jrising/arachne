> Weather variation and climate change poses risks for agricultural production, particularly for perennial crops which represent an important form of semi-durable capital in many developing countries. However, misreporting of perennial crop yields and the effects of unobserved crop management decisions can undermine our understanding of these risks. For coffee production in Brazil, I show that extreme temperatures decrease yields, but also reduce reported harvest area due to die-off and selective harvesting by farmers.  The marginal damages from extreme temperatures on production is twice their effect on reported yields, since reported yields are calculated using harvested area rather than (unobserved) bearing area. By incorporating these effects into a structural econometric framework, the effects of management decisions can be distinguished.  Accounting for hidden dynamics reveals that both a greater direct effect of extreme temperatures on biophysical yields and a die-off effect with multi-year consequences.

> Perennial crops are an important semi-durable capital base for many developing countries.  However, the dynamics of their production remain poorly understood, with the central challenge of unobserved time-series of yields, heterogeneous ages, and farmer decisions.  These issues are tightly interrelated, and highlight the importance of two hidden processes that emerge from farmer-environment interactions: selective harvesting decisions and die-off dynamics. The elucidation of these effects requires a merging of the perennial supply and statistical yield literatures, applied here to coffee production in Brazil.  Combined, these techniques allow for a full accounting of the effects of prices, weather, and their interactions for a wide range of perennial crops.

However, misreported yields, unobserved crop management decisions, and complex production dynamics, including heterogeneous ages and farmer choices, can hinder our understanding of these risks. In Brazilian coffee production, I demonstrate that extreme temperatures not only decrease yields but also reduce reported harvest areas due to die-off and farmers' selective harvesting decisions. The marginal damages from extreme temperatures on production are twice their effect on reported yields, as these yields are based on harvested area rather than the unobserved bearing area.
