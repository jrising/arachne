**user**:
> can you summarize these points  Development tam meetings cna be improved by Clear expectations of who is responsible for what information/discussions during the meeting (and, this translates to workload and role responsibilities). Discuss plan for meeting funding needs for existing work before we talk about new work.
> For the meetings where you invite project staff - it's helpful to hear the progress of how the development team is doing in terms of reaching the fundraising goals. I also enjoy the budget update and budget need instead of an end of year check in, because then if there is a huge funding gap and the development team isn't able to get funding early on in the year - we can brainstorm on how the project or program team can support the development team on funding. Maybe there'd be the need to go to more specific conferences, etc. I think spending time making sure the development team is aware of the project priorities, milestones, and funding needs/goals is helpful to spend time on and then to hear the development team's strategic approach and their project plan to find funding is great.
> I think the meetings are good, I would like to see more action items and follow-up outside of the meetings
> Hard to say since I've only been to a couple of them
> Perhaps continue sharing pre-reads and simplify the ask/ request of attendees before the meeting
> Brainstorming and prospecting to match up our program ideas with funding opportunities.

> It seems like the codes team is asked to re-explain energy codes and our funding challenges over and over at development meetings. Creating an action plan for funding would be helpful. To my knowledge, no progress on supporting energy code funding has been made in the last 2 years/5 months I've been here.
> One key thing to improve is to get more clarity further in advance of the purpose of the meeting and what I need prepared for it. I'd also appreciate more brainstorming/discussion on funding opportunities for new projects, and clearer sense of what our strategy is.
> I don't need to know the dollar totals, so I'd like to join before or after we go over those.
