> The potential environmental impacts of the construction, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind projects are important to consider in the siting of offshore wind turbines. Potential impacts include avian mortality and displacement, habitat displacement, acoustic impacts on marine mammals and sea turtles, disruption of migratory routes, and sensitive fish habitat disturbance, including impacts on endangered, threatened, and rare species. Data on the distribution and abundance of endangered, threatened, and protected species were compiled to evaluate the use of the marine environment by wildlife that may be affected by offshore wind development. Information on abundance, migration and residency, and extent of habitat can be analyzed for geographical overlap and the degree to which biologically significant impacts and dislocation of competing users may occur. From a scientific standpoint, biologically significant impacts can be considered to individuals or to populations. Impacts to individuals occur when the animal’s ability to grow, survive, and reproduce is compromised, while population-level effects can affect the viability of the species (National Research Council, 2005). Here, it is logical to consider biologically significant impacts at the population level, as many activities in the ocean can impact individuals and not every biologically significant impact to an individual will necessarily trigger the preparation of an EIS (as opposed to an EA) under NEPA. Further, while wildlife protection laws regulate impacts to individuals, they focus management attention at the population level. For example, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) ensures that stocks, or interbreeding groups of the same species, remain above the optimal sustainable population (16 USC 1361 et seq.) The Endangered Species Act (ESA) likewise manages for species, subspecies or distinct population segments (16 USC
> 1532). Lastly, benefits from CO2 reductions resulting from decreased use of fossil fuels are generally thought of on a large scale, in which benefits to wildlife would be assessed on a population level rather than individual level. From a management perspective, it is important that we consider impacts to groups larger than the individual as we look towards long-term viability of each species.

> Sea Turtles
> Although little is known of the interactions of sea turtles and offshore wind projects, interactions may be anticipated by applying the spatial and temporal patterns of sea turtles. Sea turtles can be impacted during construction, operations, and decommissioning. Sea turtles can hear, and may be especially sensitive to low frequency sounds (Ketten & Bartol, 2005; O’Hara & Wilcox, 1990). Similar to marine mammals, sea turtles could suffer from increased noise, such as behavioral impacts, habitat displacement, avoidance, and injury (NMFS, 2008). However, it is important to recognize that the extent of this has not been well documented in the offshore wind industry due to the paucity of installations in sea turtle habitat at existing installations in Europe. Pre-construction survey impacts may occur from increased vessel traffic and the use of sonars and seismic profiling devices. Construction impacts include benthic disturbance causing temporary habitat avoidance, as well as noise disturbance or injury from foundation installation. Turbine operation and maintenance can bring increased vessel traffic, and decommissioning in the form of noise and increased vessel traffic. These impacts can be minimized or effectively eliminated through the use of proper planning and understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of sea turtles species in the mid-Atlantic region.
> Four species of sea turtles can be found within the study area (Read et al., 2011). The two most commonly seen species are the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) (threatened) and the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) (endangered) (see Table 2). Sea turtles that are seen in the study area infrequently include Kemp’s ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) (endangered) and the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) (threatened). All sea turtles in the study area are jointly managed by the NMFS and the USFWS. NFMS and USFWS have not designated critical habitat for any sea turtle species in the mid-Atlantic region, although a green sea turtle did lay eggs on the beach of Cape Henlopen State Park in summer 2011, the first time in recent history (MERR Institute, 2011). With potential impacts to sea turtles during multiple stages of offshore wind development, the spatial and temporal patterns of sea turtle distribution commonly found in the mid-Atlantic were examined for this project. The NARWC database was utilized to determine sea turtle sightings in the mid-Atlantic (Kenney, 2001). The core of this database is the 1982 Cetacean and Turtle assessment Program (CETAP), which was a large effort to characterize the distribution, abundance and seasonality of turtles and marine mammals in New England and the mid-Atlantic (Kenney, 2011). Data has been subsequently added to the database as available. Based on analysis of the NARWC database, sightings for loggerhead sea turtles were the most frequent and therefore used as a proxy to demonstrate the annual and seasonal abundance of sea turtles. Point data were exported to a shapefile, and subsequently converted to a raster dataset to depict relative abundance. Raster grids of 5-minute by 5-minute were used, with the total count per cell summed and displayed as such. Therefore, the spatial locations of sea turtle sightings are depicted relative to one another. The data for loggerhead sea turtles has been effort- corrected to account for survey bias.

> The loggerhead sea turtle is the most common sea turtle seen in the study area. The loggerhead is managed as nine distinct population segments (DPS). The Northwest Atlantic loggerheads occur within the study area, consisting of five separate nesting groups/sub-populations (50 CFR Parts 223 and 224). The Northwest Atlantic loggerheads are listed as threatened, with a primary threat of entanglement with fishing gear, as well as threats on nesting beaches (NOAA Office of Protected Resources, 2011). Loggerheads are highly migratory on a seasonal basis moving south with cooling sea surface temperatures (Geo-Marine, 2010; Mansfield et al., 2009). Seasonal maps for loggerheads can be found in Maps 21-24. Their abundance in a given area is thus strongly linked to sea surface temperature. Satellite tracking of immature loggerheads has shown that they may migrate in either a neritic or oceanic (beyond the continental shelf) pathway, corresponding with oceanographic features and likely have high site fidelity (Mansfield et al., 2009). Loggerheads are common in neritic environments in the summer months, from Cape Cod south to Florida. They are commonly seen close to shore, which is consistent with recent surveys in which they were identified from 0.8 – 21 nm off the coast of New Jersey (Geo-Marine, 2010). Although loggerhead sea turtles are distributed throughout the study area, a higher density of turtles are near shore, with 26% inshore of 35-meters water depth, 74% in greater water depths, although few beyond the 60-meter contour (Map 20). The inshore areas where sea turtles are more frequently seen coincide with areas where offshore wind turbines are more likely to be installed in the near term. Presence of sea turtles is highly seasonal throughout the study area, with sightings largely skewed towards summer, followed by fall (Figure 2). Impacts from development of wind turbines are also associated with specific activities, thus development should be carefully considered with respect to sea turtles.
> 
> Relatively few sightings of leatherback sea turtles occurred in the study area, though they are the second most common identified turtle. Too few sightings are recorded to complete SPUE calculations. However, leatherback sea turtles are endangered, and have different habitat preferences and distribution than loggerheads, making a useful comparison. Leatherbacks are generally pelagic species, and are very widely distributed (NOAA Office of Protected Resources, 2011). Leatherbacks undergo an annual migration in the northwest Atlantic, leaving the tropics and migrating up the Atlantic coast, with a late spring through summer occurrence in the mid-Atlantic (Geo-Marine, 2010). It is thought that leatherbacks migrate north to feed on jellyfish (Sherrill-Mix et al., 2008). Leatherbacks are found in both neritic and pelagic environments, with high variability in habitat usage in the Atlantic Ocean, which may be linked to multiple oceanographic conditions and hatchling drift scenarios (Fossette et al., 2010), rather than a single migratory corridor. As evidenced, 73% of leatherback sightings are inshore of the 35-meter contour, though survey bias has not been accounted for in this map. Please refer to Map 25.
