> The initial analysis as described above provides a static snapshot of current exposures. This could be supplemented with scenario analyses to explore exposures – and therefore sources of physical and transition risks – on a forward-looking basis. For physical risks, the source of risk can be the extrapolation of a trend or hypothetical shock in which one or more ecosystems or ecosystem services degrade or collapse. For transition risks, existing and announced nature-related policies on a global, regional and or national level could provide a starting point to develop scenarios, like the GBF, which defines 2030 targets on, among other things, protecting 30 percent of land and water, or the reduction of harmful subsidies.

> It is relevant to understand and consider the expected time horizon for these scenarios, for example, whether they will materialise in the short, medium, or long term. Lessons can be learnt from previous work on climate scenarios when developing such forward-looking exposure analyses, and, if feasible, forward-looking risk assessments in phases 2 and 3. Nature presents a number of open questions and unique challenges that must be carefully accounted for. To assist central banks and supervisors with forward-looking analyses, the Task Force has produced a Technical Document on Nature Scenarios. The documents identify a number of challenges that must be accounted for when developing nature scenarios.
