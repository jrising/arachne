**user**:
> I am writing an exam in LaTeX. How do I create a checkbox for students to fill in on the printed paper?
**assistant**:
> To create a checkbox in LaTeX, you will need the `amssymb` package, which contains the `\Box` command for creating an empty box. Here's how you do it:
> 
> ```latex
> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage{amssymb}
> 
> \begin{document}
> 
> \begin{itemize}
> \item $\Box$ Option 1
> \item $\Box$ Option 2
> \item $\Box$ Option 3
> \end{itemize}
> 
> \end{document}
> ```
> 
> In the document above, each `\Box` command creates a checkbox. Note, however, that these checkboxes cannot be checked interactively in the PDF, but they are perfect for printed documents.
> 
> If you want to create a filled box, you can use the `\CheckedBox` command. Here is an example:
> 
> ```latex
> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage{amssymb}
> 
> \begin{document}
> 
> \begin{itemize}
> \item $\Box$ Option 1
> \item $\CheckedBox$ Option 2
> \item $\Box$ Option 3
> \end{itemize}
> 
> \end{document}
> ```
> 
> In this document, the second option appears checked. Again, the boxes are not interactively checkable in the PDF.
