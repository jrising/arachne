> That sounds like a memorable and symbolic encounter! Falcons are often seen as symbols of vision, freedom, and determination. Having one hover over your wedding might be interpreted as a sign of good fortune and the strength and clarity to soar to new heights in your marriage. I hope your wedding day was as wonderful and full of meaning as the falcon's majestic presence suggests! Would you like to share more about your wedding or anything else about the event?
