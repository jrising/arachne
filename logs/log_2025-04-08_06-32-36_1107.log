> 
> There are many health co-benefits of climate change mitigation policies across a range of sectors. The magnitude of the benefits depends on context, including the specific policy, baseline exposure of the population to air pollution, the sources of the pollution, prevailing patterns of physical activity, and food consumption. Capitalizing on the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation actions is a win-win strategy that can improve public health while addressing the climate crisis.
> 
> **Key messages include:**
> 
> - Health benefits from mitigation in the long term include avoiding dramatic increases in heat-related mortality projected for later this century, particularly under high emissions scenarios. In the short term, benefits include reduced air pollution, increased consumption of healthy and more sustainable diets, and improved physical health from more sustainable transportation modes.
> - Fossil fuel-related ambient outdoor air pollution has been estimated to cause over five million premature deaths per year worldwide, over half of which are linked to coal combustion.
> - The Food Systems Economics Commission has estimated that the economic value of the damage caused by current food systems to human health and the planet is well over ten trillion dollars annually, which is more than they contribute to global GDP.
> - A diverse diet high in plant-based foods and low in animal products could prevent about eleven million premature deaths annually by twenty fifty, according to the EAT-Lancet Commission. Such a diet would significantly reduce the environmental impact of the food system by decreasing methane emissions from ruminant animals. Affordability and cultural acceptability will be crucial in determining the uptake of such diets.
> - More sustainable transport systems that provide opportunities for walking and cycling in relative safety and equitable access to public transport offer prospects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving health. Including economic valuation of health benefits in their appraisal can substantially increase estimates of their cost-effectiveness.
