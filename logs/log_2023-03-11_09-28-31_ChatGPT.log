> Once upon a time, there was a beautiful land filled with flowers, trees, and animals. The sun would shine brightly every day, and everything was happy and colorful.
> 
> But sometimes, the land would get very thirsty, and the flowers and trees would start to droop. The animals would get very hot and tired, and they would wish for something to cool them down.
> 
> That's when the clouds would come along. The clouds were fluffy and white, and they would float high up in the sky. They would look down on the thirsty land and see how much it needed some water.
> 
> So the clouds would gather together and start to fill up with water. They would collect all the water they could find, from the rivers and the oceans and the lakes.
> 
> And then, when they were full of water, the clouds would start to get heavy. They would get so heavy that they couldn't float anymore, and they would start to sink down towards the ground.
> 
> And that's when the rain would start to fall. The raindrops would come out of the clouds and fall down to the thirsty land. They would splash onto the flowers and trees and animals, and everyone would be so happy.
> 
> The rain would cool everything down, and the land would drink up all the water it needed. The flowers would stand up tall and the trees would get greener, and the animals would run around and play.
> 
> And that's why it rains, my little friend. So that the land can drink up all the water it needs, and everything can be happy and beautiful once again.
