> ## Introduction
> 
> The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) offers a transformative opportunity to enhance grid services through optimized energy management. This project seeks to harness the potential of EVs and charging stations to generate significant savings or revenue by participating in various energy markets. These include utility markets, such as selective non-peak charging (demand response) and energy arbitrage by capitalizing on price fluctuations, as well as RTO ancillary services like offering regulation and reserve services.
> 
> Traditional heuristic approaches to managing these opportunities can overlook the intricate optimization challenge presented by the complex interdependencies of EVs and the energy markets. This project addresses this challenge by developing a sophisticated optimization framework that combines considerations of uncertainty in market prices and EV capacity with the operational constraints faced by EV owners.
> 
> ### Scope and Objectives
> 
> The primary goal of this project is to maximize profit at the aggregator level via optimal grid service participation. By doing so, the project also aims to enhance decision-making related to fleet-wide EV charging schedules, accommodating the intrinsic variability in daily operations. This endeavor is predicated on the assumption of a fleet of vehicles with predefined schedules, yet remains robust to deviations from expected behavior.
> 
> Achieving these goals involves four key steps:
> 
> 1. **Price Projection Model**: The development of a statistical model to project 24-hour ahead energy prices, capturing full uncertainty through a k-nearest-neighbor approach. This model is updated daily just before bid submission, providing critical inputs for the optimization model.
> 
> 2. **Dynamic Programming Optimization**: Creation of a dynamic programming model designed to maximize profits. This model incorporates the uncertain and autocorrelated nature of price evolution, anticipates the total available vehicle fleet capacity, and accounts for efficiency losses.
> 
> 3. **Simulation and Analysis**: Performing simulations to evaluate the benefits of the optimized strategy and to analyze model performance under extreme and realistic conditions. This step serves to quantify the advantages of optimization over traditional heuristic methods.
> 
> 4. **Implementation for Nuvve's GIVe Aggregator**: Translating the developed model into an implementable framework by Nuvve. This includes identifying simplifying assumptions that ensure operational efficiency without compromising optimization performance.
