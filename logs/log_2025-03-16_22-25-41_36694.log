> Section Two: Systemic Risks, a Framing. Scale is important in three ways. First, a system at a place may be vulnerable to pressures and challenges from a much larger geographic area. For example, food price shocks in a place may be driven by production shocks elsewhere. Second, a systemic risk in one location may feed into risks elsewhere through larger higher-level linkages. For example, an increase in local insecurity may overflow to other countries through population displacement. Third, a systemic risk could directly affect some global system, for example, widespread crop failures affecting global food markets. The focus here is on systemic risks which generate an international response. This can be through a local risk with international consequences, or a risk that arises in several places at once.

> In business, political, and military terms, a systemic risk is typically seen as a cascading consequence of an external shock, a domino effect. Systemic risks generated by climate change are different because climate change will generate a number of acute shocks, often termed as "black swans," superimposed on a longer-term chronic change, such as in the climatic suitability for agriculture, which may push systems into failure, often termed as "grey rhinos." These acute shocks and chronic changes are occurring across the world, and both vary from place to place and are geographically connected. Climate change is also superimposed onto other pressures and changes, such as increases in population, economic development pressures, and increasing economic inequality.
> 
> A direct risk of climate change is a specific impact on a specific part of a system which can be directly attributed to weather or climate, such as a drought affecting crop production or a heatwave affecting human health. It can be characterized in biophysical terms, like the magnitude of a drought index or the number of days with temperature exceeding some threshold, for example, or in human terms, such as the reduction in crop growth or numbers of people suffering ill-health. A systemic risk, in contrast, is one which affects the integrity of a system as a whole and is the consequence of the nature of linkages between parts of the system. The concept of systemic risk was introduced in the financial sector, and most empirical studies, therefore, come from that sector. However, the concept has since been applied more widely. The scope of a systemic risk depends on the definition of the system of interest, from the transport system, for example, to the world economic system, but the key point is that a systemic risk is much more consequential than a direct risk.
