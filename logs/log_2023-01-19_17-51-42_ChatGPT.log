**assistant**:
> In Julia, you can use the "TwoSampleTTest" function from the "HypothesisTests" package to perform a two-sample t-test. Here is an example of how you can use this function:
> 
> ```julia
> using HypothesisTests
> 
> # sample data
> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
> y = [3, 4, 5, 6]
> 
> # perform the t-test
> result = TwoSampleTTest(x, y)
> 
> # print the test statistic and p-value
> println("t-statistic: ", result.tstat)
> println("p-value: ", result.pvalue)
> ```
> You can also use the ttest function from the StatsBase package, with the following example:
> ```julia
> using StatsBase
> 
> # sample data
> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
> y = [3, 4, 5, 6]
> 
> # perform the t-test
> t_stat, p_val = ttest(x, y)
> 
> # print the test statistic and p-value
> println("t-statistic: ", t_stat)
> println("p-value: ", p_val)
> ```
> It is important to note that the null hypothesis is that the two samples have the same mean and the alternative hypothesis is that they have different means.
