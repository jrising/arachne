**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. As part of this work, I have conducted a survey, asking respondents to discuss data and datagaps. Below are responses they have given:
> 
> Respondent 1:
> 
> 3.1 Can you identify any important information about the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean that you feel is currently not available or insufficient?
> real time monitoring and detection of whale presence in heavily utilized areas, shifts in marine species populations and distributions due to climate change
> 3.2 How would this additional information benefit you or your organization/business?
> whale monitoring will help offshore wind and other ocean transportation users avoid and minimize disturbance to these marine mammals, changes in species abundance and distribution due to climate change will help to elucidate and parse out any effects of offshore wind development on marine species that are separate from the rapid changes due to climate.
> Respondent 3:
> 
> 3.1 Can you identify any important information about the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean that you feel is currently not available or insufficient?
> EIS frequently omit or misrepresent population and species data for the species that we are authorized to protect. In addition, direct notification of planned impactful projects is rarely made to our organization.
> 3.2 How would this additional information benefit you or your organization/business?
> It would allow us as stakeholders to contribute to the planning phase of projects and to inform environmental considerations and mitigations
> 3.3 Do you have suggestions for how data collection or distribution could be improved?
> Comprehensive data should include complete species, population, and distribution data for marine mammal and sea turtle species in Delaware coastal waters.  Distribution of data that includes this information will help to provide more accurate EIS for proposed industrial projects.
> Respondent 4:
> 3.1 Can you identify any important information about the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean that you feel is currently not available or insufficient?
> Wetland health and statewide plans to control flooding
> 3.2 How would this additional information benefit you or your organization/business?
> Incorporating coastal resilience best practices will allow communities to plan for future sea level rise
> 3.3 Do you have suggestions for how data collection or distribution could be improved?
> Open and more frequent communication between the State, Counties and Municipalities
> Respondent 5:
> 
> 3.1 Can you identify any important information about the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean that you feel is currently not available or insufficient?
> Limited sediment data both offshore and in estuarine wetlands
> 3.2 How would this additional information benefit you or your organization/business?
> improve efforts to map and model environmental phenomena
> Respondent 6:
> 3.1 Can you identify any important information about the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean that you feel is currently not available or insufficient?
> We have a pretty well described array of environmental monitors and sensors. Unfortunately, our biological data are not as spatially or temporally robust.
> 3.2 How would this additional information benefit you or your organization/business?
> Improvements to management, and research accuracy.
> 3.3 Do you have suggestions for how data collection or distribution could be improved?
> We could increase data collection frequency to improve temporal and spatial resolution of the trends we are predicting.
> Respondent 7:
> 3.1 Can you identify any important information about the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean that you feel is currently not available or insufficient?
> Our own agency is working to fill some gaps in information, particularly around sea level rise and salinity. Another example is that there are numerous contaminants of emerging concern that are understudied. We are also working to find finanical support to build out a comprehensive data portal for the Delaware River Basin.
> 3.2 How would this additional information benefit you or your organization/business?
> better management decisions across agencies and stakeholders, better transparency and value proposition for funding of work via grants and appropriations.
> 3.3 Do you have suggestions for how data collection or distribution could be improved?
> DRBC has a good model for communicating and coordinating work in this area through its Monitoring Advisory and Coordination Committee. Recommending speakers or new members would help improve these efforts. https://www.nj.gov/drbc/about/advisory/MACC_index.html Supporting science and policy convenings like the PDE Science and Environmental Summit and PDE/DRBC joint Climate Forum are appreciated. 
> Respondent 8:
> 3.2 How would this additional information benefit you or your organization/business?
> Place a value on what it brings to Sussex County's tourism economy
> I have a few questions asking you to summarize these responses.
> First, across these responses, can you construct a bullet point list of the data gaps that have been identified?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James. Here is a summary of identified data gaps based on the information provided:
> 
> 1. Real-time monitoring and detection of whale presence in heavily utilized areas.
> 2. Shifts in marine species populations and distributions due to climate change.
> 3. Accurate and representational population and species data for species under protection.
> 4. Direct notifications of planned impactful projects to relevant organizations.
> 5. Assessment of wetland health and statewide plans to control flooding.
> 6. Sediment data from both offshore and estuarine wetlands.
> 7. Robust biological data that matches the existing array of environmental monitors and sensors in spatial and temporal resolution.
> 8. Comprehensive data on sea level rise and salinity.
> 9. More information on contaminants of emerging concern.
> 10. Financial support for the expansion of a comprehensive data portal for the Delaware River Basin.
> 11. Value analysis of data as it pertains to Sussex County's tourism economy.
**user**:
> Second, we have organized our data gaps report into the following subsections:
> Activities: Aquaculture (oyster and other), Conservation (coastal, marine, salt marsh), Commercial fishing, Cultural sites and activities (history, tribal), Energy and mineral resources (wind, other energy, sand), Infrastructure, Military (operations, former sites), Navigation services (services, ports, ship building), Navigation (activity, anchorage, lightering), Recreation (beach, water, fishing), Science and technology, Transportation (freight, ferry), Inlets and Outlets (water intake, waste disposal)
> Other data: Administrative coverage, Bathymetry, Species and Habitats (bird, fish, mammal, other, generic habitats), Ocean chemistry and climate, Ocean economy
> 
> Can you map the responses into these categories?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, James. Here's how the responses from the survey map onto your report subsections:
> 
> **Activities:**
> - Conservation (coastal, marine, salt marsh): Information on wetland health, sea level rise, and salinity; also relates to shifts in marine species populations due to climate change.
> - Energy and mineral resources (wind, other energy, sand): Data on real-time whale monitoring can help avoid disturbance to marine mammals by offshore wind and other ocean transportation users.
> - Science and technology: Improved efforts to map and model environmental phenomena through better sediment data and real-time monitoring.
> - Navigation services (services, ports, ship building), Navigation (activity, anchorage, lightering): Information like direct notification of planned impactful projects to conservationist organizations for better environmental considerations and mitigations.
> 
> **Other Data:**
> - Bathymetry: Limited sediment data both offshore and in estuarine wetlands, affecting modeling of environmental phenomena.
> - Species and Habitats (bird, fish, mammal, other, generic habitats): Acquisition of spatially and temporally robust biological data. Complete species, population, and distribution data for marine mammal and sea turtle species. Shifts in marine species populations due to climate change.
> - Ocean chemistry and climate: Changes in species abundance and distribution to parse out effects of offshore wind development, apart from climate change impacts; understudied contaminants of emerging concern.
> - Ocean economy: Place a value on the data as it pertains to Sussex County's tourism economy.
> 
> Some of the responses also touch on systemic improvements and do not fit into a single category, such as:
> - Improving communication between the State, Counties, and Municipalities.
> - Recommendations for how data collection frequency can be increased.
> - Better transparency and value proposition for the funding of environmental work.
> - Encouragement for involvement in committees like DRBC's Monitoring Advisory and Coordination Committee and support for scientific and policy convenings.
> 
> These systemic improvements would cut across several of the subsections, as they speak to the overall enhancement of data collection, communication, and utilization practices.
