> please sumarize :The building and construction sector continues to account for almost 40% of global CO2 emissions, equivalent to just under 10 gigatons. In 2022, it increased its emissions by 1%, while its energy intensity dropped by 3.5%. This is both bad and good news, as we grapple with how to build and retrofit buildings in way that makes financial sense yet reduces emissions and increases resiliency in a meaningful way. Performance regulations, for both new and existing buildings, are one way to approach this. There’s never a dull day for buildings in the DC region, and this Spring has been no different. Here’s a rundown of some of the major regulatory developments in the greater DC area

> The building and construction sector is responsible for nearly 40% of global CO2 emissions, which translates to just under 10 gigatons. Despite seeing a 1% increase in emissions in 2022, the sector's energy intensity experienced a 3.5% drop, signaling both challenges and progress in reducing emissions and enhancing resilience in a cost-effective manner. Performance regulations for both new and existing structures present a potential solution. The Washington D.C. region, known for its dynamic building landscape, continues to experience significant regulatory developments.
