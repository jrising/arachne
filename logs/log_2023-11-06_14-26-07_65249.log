> Temperature Changes
> Since the late 19th century, global mean surface temperature has increased by about 1.0°C, with the trend accelerating after 1980. Almost every location on the planet has exhibited an upward temperature trend over this period (Wuebbles et al. 2017). Warming has also been substantially faster over land than the ocean— between 1880–1900 and 1997–2017, the land has warmed 1.4°C (2.5°F) on average while the oceans warmed roughly 0.6°C (1.1°F) (GISTEMP Team 2018).
> As one would expect, given the array of factors affecting temperatures, the overall rise in temperatures has not been smooth over time or homogenous across space. For example, warming was dampened in the 1950s–1970s, most likely as a result of both aerosol emissions, which reflected sunlight away from the planet (Maher, Gupta, and England 2014), and natural variability. Since 1980, the most rapid warming has occurred in the far north, where the replacement of highly reflective summer sea ice with dark, open ocean rapidly increases the absorption of sunlight and local warming (Serreze and Barry 2011).
> A heavily discussed period of slowed average warming over 1998–2013, the so-called “hiatus,” now appears fully consistent with the natural variance of the climate system (Cahill, Rahmstorf, and Parnell 2015), as can be readily seen in the overlay of simulated and observed temperature time series in the right panel of Figure 2. Relative to the distribution of simulations for the first decade of the 21st century, the observed values fall toward the low end of projections but never leave the envelope of expected variations. However, in addition to natural variability, it is thought that some model simulations warmed too quickly because the emissions scenarios in the RCPs underrepresented volcanic and human aerosol emissions after 2005 (Medhaug, Stolpe, Fischer, and Knutti 2017).
> Based on the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of CMIP5 simulations, projected global mean surface temperature is likely to rise 0.9–2.3°C (1.6–4.1°F) above preindustrial levels (defined as the 1850–1900 average) by 2080–2100 under a low-emissions scenario, 1.7–3.3°C (3.1–5.9°F) under a moderate-emissions scenario (shown in Figure 2), and 3.2–5.4°C (5.8–9.7°F) under a high-emissions scenario (Collins et al. 2013).
> As in the past, warming will be more rapid over land, where most economic activity occurs, compared to over the ocean. The only location on the surface that is projected by some models to cool is a very small portion of the North Atlantic Ocean just south of Greenland, where changing ocean circulation may induce cooling. Although warming will continue to occur fastest over the Arctic, average summer temperature will diverge from the historical range soonest in low-latitude regions, which experience lower historical variance. Figure 3A illustrates regional heterogeneities in the rate of warming (in °C) that are otherwise masked by globally averaged summary statistics. The map depicts the average warming at each location associated with a 1°C increase in global mean temperature; values greater than 1°C indicate rates of warming faster than the global mean, while values below 1°C indi- cate warming that is slower than the global mean.

The cluster in the bottom left of the figure in blue text indicates historically observed temperatures, while the cluster in the upper right of the figure in red text indicates average projected mean tempera- tures for 2080–2099 across models simulating a high-emissions scenario. This layout allows for projected future temperatures to be matched to historical analogs. For example, future summers in Vermont will be similar to historical summers in Mary- land, summers in Connecticut will be similar to past summers in Arizona, future summer in New Jersey will be slightly hotter than historical Louisiana summers, and future summers in Georgia and Florida will be much hotter than anything previ- ously experienced in the United States. As shown in Panel B, a similar analysis at the level of countries shows that future temperatures in Norway are projected to be similar to historical temperatures in Germany, future Mexico will be slightly hotter than historical Iraq, future Indonesia will be similar to historical Mali, and India and Thailand are projected to be hotter than any country presently on Earth.6
> Precipitation Changes
> A warmer atmosphere is capable of holding more water vapor, leading to an increase in overall average precipitation (rainfall and snowfall). Observed precipita- tion in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere has increased since the 1950s. Heavy precipitation events in particular have increased, most clearly in North America

> and Europe, where the most data is collected (Hartmann et al. 2013). Both of these changes are consistent with those expected on a warming planet. However, because the atmospheric dynamics that govern precipitation involve both large motions of air masses and processes that occur at scales below the spatial resolution of many climate models, precipitation changes are considerably more challenging to model numerically than temperature changes. This difficulty, combined with the array of changes in temperature, wind, humidity and other factors that all affect when and where precipitation falls, have rendered projections of precipitation changes more complex and more uncertain than projections of temperature.
> There is large heterogeneity in the sign of projected precipitation change, with many locations getting wetter while many others get drier. Precipitation dynamics are also strongly affected by internal variability—such as the El Niño–Southern

> Oscillation—and projections for specific locations depend upon changes in large-scale patterns of atmospheric circulation (Collins et al. 2013). Figure 3B illustrates average changes in local rainfall for each 1°C increase in global mean temperature. At many locations, there is a large range of uncertainty for projected changes, with plausible projections allowing for no change. Simple summary statements like “dry regions are likely become generally drier and wet regions are likely to become generally wetter” hold well over the ocean, but are coarse descriptions of the complex precipitation changes that may occur over land (Greve et al. 2014). In the United States, the most robust projections are for a springtime drying of the Southwest, summertime drying of the Northwest, and increase in winter and spring precipitation in the Northeast, upper Midwest, and northern Great Plains (Houser et al. 2015).
> Humidity Changes
> Specific humidity is the total moisture content of air. Relative humidity is the ratio of specific humidity to a theoretical maximum moisture capacity, which rises exponentially as temperature increases. Since the 1970s, global mean specific humidity has increased; however, there is little evidence of an increase in global mean relative humidity and some evidence for a decline, possibly reflecting faster warming of the land than of the oceans, which are the primary source of atmospheric moisture (Sherwood and Fu 2014). Models that project that the largest increases in temperature on land also tend to predict the largest decreases in relative humidity (Fischer and Knutti 2013).
> One reason that humidity is thought to be economically important is that it affects human health, since higher humidity levels make it more difficult for the human body to cool itself in hot conditions through sweating. One physical metric closely related to the combined effect of heat and humidity is wet-bulb temperature. Wet- bulb temperatures are measured using a ventilated thermometer wrapped in a wet cloth, and are strongly related to the experienced conditions of a sweating person.
> Dangerously hot and humid conditions are projected to become dramati- cally more likely in several regions around the world (Sherwood and Huber 2010). For example, Houser et al. (2015) defined “dangerously hot and humid days” as those characterized by peak wet-bulb temperatures over 80°F. By this definition, dangerously hot and humid days are “typical of the most humid parts of Texas and Louisiana in the hottest summer month, and the most humid summer days in Washington and Chicago.” Their analysis found that, in the southeastern United States, the population-weighted frequency of dangerously hot and humid days are projected to rise from 8 per year on average in 1981–2010 to 17–28 days per year over 2040–2059 in a moderate emissions scenario and to 40–70 days/year on average over 2080–2099 in a high emissions scenario (Houser et al. 2015).
> Tropical Cyclones
> Tropical cyclones are the class of phenomena that includes tropical storms, typhoons, hurricanes, and cyclones; these categories are distinguished by wind speed and the ocean basin where the storm occurs. Tropical cyclones are driven by the temperature difference between the warm ocean surface and cooler temperatures higher in the atmosphere. The warm ocean moistens overlying air, which rises and
>

> cools, releasing energy and rain. Thus, climate change is thought to have counter- vailing effects on storms: warming sea surface temperatures fuel storms, but warming temperatures higher in the atmosphere may suppress them (Knutson et al. 2010).
> Tropical cyclone formation and storm trajectory depend on myriad additional factors, especially wind patterns, which introduce additional complexity into projec- tions of their future changes. Furthermore, inconsistent historical data on storms in the open ocean prior to the satellite era make inferences difficult. However, there is evidence that the frequency and intensity of the strongest storms in the Atlantic have been increasing since the 1970s, and some evidence that humans contributed to this change (Walsh et al. 2016).
> Efforts to model all of these factors together broadly agree that the frequency of intense tropical cyclones (such as category 4 and 5 hurricanes), as well as the average intensity of their associated rainfall, is projected to increase with warming (Kossin et al. 2017). The effect on total number of storms remains less certain, though most studies suggest a stable or decreasing quantity of lower-intensity storms. The effect of climate change on storm tracks (the paths that storms take toward land) is uncertain and may offset or enhance the effect of increased storm intensity in some regions.
> The spatial distribution of these changing risks is heterogeneous. For example, systematic changes in the spatial distribution of storm tracks within an ocean basin may reallocate cyclone risk between populations, even if the overall frequency of storms does not change. Across ocean basins, models generally agree in projecting substantial increases of storm intensity in the West Pacific, affecting East Asia and Oceania, with some decreases in activity occurring in the Indian Ocean, affecting Southern Asia and East Africa. Projecting changes in the North Atlantic, which affects Central and North America, has been more challenging; the greatest scien- tific uncertainty persists for this area (Knutson et al. 2010; Christensen et al. 2013).
> Humans may also affect the genesis and growth of tropical cyclones through the regional effects of aerosol pollution. Aerosols aloft may cool local sea surface temperatures, by reflecting sunlight before it reaches the sea surface, as well as heat higher levels in the atmosphere, by absorbing sunlight when the particles are dark-colored. Both of these effects generally work to weaken storms, and storm activity in recent decades may have been greater had greenhouse gas co-pollutants been absent (Walsh et al. 2016).
> Sea-Level Rise
> Global mean sea-level rise is driven by two processes: an increase in the volume of the water already in the ocean, which occurs as the water warms and expands, and an increase in the mass of water in the ocean, primarily from the melting of ice on land. Since 1900, global mean sea level has increased by about 18–21 cm, with the rate of rise since about 1990 being 2–2.5 times faster than during the preceding nine decades. A substantial fraction of this rise is attributable to human-caused climate change (Sweet et al. 2017). Regional sea-level changes can differ substantively from this global trend, modulated by changes in currents and winds; changes in Earth’s gravitational field, rotation, crust, and mantle that occur as land ice changes; and changes in the height of land that result from compaction of sediments, plate
> 
> tectonics, the ongoing mantle response to historical land ice changes, and other factors (Kopp, Hay, Little, and Mitrovica 2015). Historic sea-level rise has led to a detectable increase in the frequency of coastal flooding, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude (Sweet and Park 2014).
> Due to the slow response time of the oceans and ice sheets, sea-level rise is fairly insensitive to alternative emissions scenarios for the first half of this century. Across studies, median projections of future global mean sea-level rise are 20–30 cm during 2000–2050, with less than a 5 percent chance of exceeding 50 cm (for a review see Horton et al. 2018).
> After 2050, projections become more deeply uncertain, due to both uncer- tain human emissions and the uncertain response of the polar ice sheets (Kopp, DeConto, et al. 2017). Median projections for 2000–2100 range from 40–80 cm for a low-emissions scenario to 70–150 cm for a high-emissions scenario. However, global mean sea-level rise of as much as 250 cm by 2100 cannot be ruled out. For reference, the last time global temperatures were about as high as they currently are (about 125,000 years ago), global mean sea-level was about 6–9 meters higher than today. Some coastal areas will be inundated permanently; others will be protected by additional investments to be incurred. The resulting increase in the frequency of tide- and wave-driven flooding is expected to render some low-lying island states uninhabitable (Storlazzi et al. 2018).
> In addition to increasing average high-tide levels, a major economic conse- quence of sea-level rise results from its interaction with tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones (like the “nor’easter” storms that sometimes hit the north- eastern United States). Storm surges that occur during these storms can impose major costs and sea-level rise adds roughly linearly to peak storm surge height. Figure 5 illus- trates the joint effects of projected sea-level rise and changing tropical cyclone activity on the flood risk of Miami, FL, and New York, NY (Hsiang et al. 2017). The extent of areas expected to flood with a 1 percent annual probability increases substantially after 2050 for Miami but much earlier in the century for many regions of New York.
> Droughts and Floods
> By altering temperature and precipitation patterns, climate change alters the frequency and intensity of extreme moisture conditions, such as droughts and floods. There is a limited but increasing ability to attribute intensifying extreme floods and drought to human activity. For example, Emanuel (2017) estimated that climate forcing by humans amplified the probability of rainfall experienced by Texans during Hurricane Harvey six-fold.
> Since 1950, the likelihood of drought has increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa and decreased in central North America and northwestern Australia (Hartmann et al. 2013); again, assessment of the human role in this trend is chal- lenging (Bindoff et al. 2013). Some measures of drought in the United States have increased due to warming, which increases evaporation and exhibits an anthropo- genic signal (Wehner, Arnold, Knutson, Kunkel, and Legrande 2017). In model projections, the frequency of droughts tends to increase in dry regions (Collins et al. 2013), which are also projected to expand. Prolonged hot and dry periods are

> projected to become substantially more frequent in many grassland areas with low agricultural productivity, regions that today often depend on livestock production (Bell, Sum, Longmate, Tseng, and Hsiang 2018). In regions with more vegetation, amplifying oscillations between heavy rainfall and drought is projected to increase the frequency of wildfires (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016) because vegetative fuel grows rapidly during wet periods then becomes flammable during dry periods.
> The observed increase in heavy precipitation suggests that climate change is contributing to increasing rain-driven flood damages ( Jiménez Cisneros, Oki, et al. 2014). Projected increases in heavy precipitation and shorter-lived snowpack are likely to further increase the frequency of inland flooding. In addition to changing rain- fall patterns, rising sea levels amplify the frequency of coastal flooding (Buchanan, Oppenheimer, and Kopp 2017). Changing patterns of flood risk are of particular economic importance, as flooding is recognized as one of the costliest classes of disaster globally (Swiss Re Institute 2018). However, in many cases, the dominant drivers of increased flood damages are related to the number of people and extent of development affected by the flood rather than the physical size of the flood.
> Clouds
> Understanding clouds is scientifically important, because they generate competing feedbacks in the climate system. However, cloud physics are complex, and many important dynamics occur at a spatial resolution finer than those used
>    Current 2030 2050 2100
>

> in most global climate models, generating substantial uncertainty in the projected changes in cloud cover for many regions of the world.
> On the one hand, clouds reflect visible light, so increases in cloud cover, partic- ularly low-altitude cloud cover, can increase the fraction of incoming sunlight that is reflected before it warms the Earth’s surface. On the other hand, clouds absorb outgoing infrared radiation leaving the Earth’s surface and thus contribute to the green- house effect, so increases in cloud cover can amplify warming (Boucher et al. 2013).
> To date, global-scale changes in cloudiness remain unclear. Looking forward, some analyses suggest the potential for circulation changes leading to large-scale, nonlinear reductions in low-latitude cloudiness with warming that could substantially increase the sensitivity of temperature to CO2 forcing (Caballero and Huber 2013).
> One way in which cloud science may become important to economists is in the rapidly growing research field of “geoengineering” or “climate engineering,” which considers various proposals to intentionally alter the climate so as to coun- teract some effects of greenhouse gas emissions (Caldeira, Bala, and Cao 2013). The most widely proposed intervention is “solar radiation management,” which involves increasing the reflectivity of the atmosphere in order to shade and cool the surface. One proposed mechanism for increasing reflectivity is to spray aerosol precursors into the upper atmosphere, mimicking the mechanism through which historical volcanic eruptions have cooled the surface. Another proposal, with more localized and shorter lasting effects, is “cloud brightening,” achieved by manipu- lating cloud-droplet size by spraying particles into lower portions of the atmosphere. A theoretically appealing feature of cloud-brightening proposals is that cloud brightening might be used to temporarily cool a city or ecosystem during particu- larly damaging heat waves, although the various economic costs and unintended effects of such policies remain poorly studied (Proctor et al. 2018).
> Ocean Acidification
> As the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increases, some of this CO2 will dissolve into ocean water, where it will form carbonic acid and increase ocean acidity. Currently, the ocean absorbs roughly one-quarter of global CO2 emissions through this process.
> The rate of acidification depends on local chemistry, temperature, circulation patterns, and freshwater inputs. For example, in the North Pacific during the last three decades, surface ocean acidity has increased by about 12 percent. Globally, the current rate of acidification is unparalleled in at least the last 55 million years, as reflected in a variety of chemical indicators from ocean sediments (Hönisch et al. 2012). In a high-emissions scenario, global mean surface ocean acidity is projected to increase 100–150 percent ( Jewett and Romanou 2017).
> Ocean acidification is thought to alter marine ecosystems substantially, although the magnitude of these effects is not well understood. The acidity of ocean waters is known to alter the ability of organisms, such as clams or corals, to create the hard shells and reefs that they depend on for survival, effects with largely unknown conse- quences for the various fish stocks and other marine products consumed around the world.
> 
> 24 Journal of Economic Perspectives
> Ecosystems
> Numerous ecosystem changes that can be directly related to climate change have been observed. In many locations around the world, a broad suite of terrestrial organ- isms is migrating toward higher altitudes and latitudes (Chen, Hill, Ohlemüller, Roy, and Thomas 2011). In the oceans, fish are migrating to stay within their preferred water temperatures (Pinsky, Worm, Fogarty, Sarmiento, and Levin 2013). Under moderate- and high-emissions scenarios, many slow-moving terrestrial species like the coastal redwoods (Roberts and Hamann 2016) may be unable to track the northward movement of climate zones—roughly 0.1–1.3 km per year (Loarie et al. 2009)—quickly enough to stay within their thermal tolerances. In many instances, the ability of species to migrate is further aggravated by fragmentation of habitat. Overall, high-latitude ecosystems are likely to be transformed by invasions from lower latitudes, and extinctions may be common at lower latitudes (Pörtner et al. 2014).
> Coral reefs—home to more than a million species—are threatened by both high temperatures and ocean acidification (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). Bleaching events associated with high temperatures have become more frequent and exten- sive, with widespread events spanning the tropics in 1998, 2010, and 2015–2016 (Hughes et al. 2017), and a majority of coral reefs around the world are projected to be at risk of degradation even under a low-emissions scenario (Frieler et al. 2013).
> The relationships between climate change and ecosystem change can be difficult to untangle, because climate is only one of many human-caused factors affecting ecosystems. For example, land-use change, overexploitation, species intro- ductions, nitrogen deposition, and water resource development also play major roles and may exhibit trends that are correlated with climate change (Chapin et al. 2000). But it is worth noting that although the causes of mass extinction events in Earth’s geological history are complex and difficult to pin down, a growing body of evidence suggests that a number of the largest mass extinctions coincided with large-scale climate changes (for example, Payne and Clapham 2012).
> Tipping Elements and Critical Thresholds
> Nonlinearities and feedbacks in the Earth systems give rise to the potential for multiple stable states of different parts of the Earth system, with potentially rapid lock-in of a state shift once critical thresholds are crossed. These parts of the Earth system are often called “tipping elements,” and the their thresholds called “tipping points.” However, the “tipping point” language can create confusion about the speed with which state shifts can occur. In popular discourse and much of the economic analysis of climate change, changes associated with a “tipping point” are described as occurring “rapidly.” This description is accurate in a geological context, insofar as these changes are rapid relative to other comparable drivers of similar changes in the Earth system. But this description can be misleading in some economic contexts; while some state shifts may be rapid on a human timescale, others may play out over millennia. Below, we summarize a few examples; see Kopp, Shwom, Wagner, and Yuan (2016) for a detailed review.
> Tipping elements can exist in the atmosphere/ocean circulation. For example, many of the climate oscillations mentioned earlier, such as El Niño–Southern
> 
> Oscillation, occur due to tipping elements, and these patterns may undergo substan- tial shifts in frequency and amplitude in a warmer climate. Large-scale patterns of ocean circulation, such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation—an important component of global ocean circulation that plays a major role in setting temperature, precipitation, and sea level in the North Atlantic—are also potential tipping elements. These atmosphere/ocean tipping elements are among those most likely to undergo rapid shifts.
> Tipping elements also occur in ice sheets. For example, positive feedbacks involving ocean-ice sheet interactions might cause sustained ice sheet loss in the Antarctic that would eventually raise global mean sea level by multiple meters or tens of meters. Indeed, some evidence suggests that multiple meters of future sea- level rise from the Antarctic may already be locked in, although depending on the pace of regional warming this rise may take many centuries to manifest.
> Tipping elements can also exist in the carbon cycle and in ecosystems. For example, warming of previously frozen soils (permafrost) is allowing microbes to decompose freshly unfrozen organic material into CO2 and methane. These releases may be an important positive feedback on warming, which could potentially amplify warming by several tenths of a degree in the 21st century. Ecosystems are also well known to undergo rapid regime shifts; coral reefs, whose bleaching is discussed above, are a notable example.
> How Economists Can Help Climate Science
> We close with a few thoughts on how economists can provide support to climate science.
> Improving Emissions Forecasts
> Forecasts for greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades and centuries are a key ingredient to physical simulations of climate change. Emissions clearly depend on global economic activity, but there is not a one-to-one mapping of economic fore- casts and the standardized RCP emissions scenarios discussed earlier. Because global emissions are a single time series, there are many possible future configurations of the global economy, technology, and policy that could produce each emissions trajectory.
> The coordinated standardization exercise that produced the RCP emissions scenarios also constructed a set of five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which represent standardized population projections, forecasts of economic growth and convergence, and forecasts of technological change in both the energy sector and adaptation technologies. SSPs can be loosely thought of as potential “states of the world” that might be realized in the future and which no single country can unilaterally change through policy. The narrative for SSP 1 is “Sustainability,” repre- senting a world with low barriers to both mitigation and adaptation; SSP 2 represents a “Middle of the Road” scenario; SSP 3 is “Regional Rivalry,” representing a world with high barriers to both mitigation and adaptation; SSP 4 is “Inequality,” repre- senting a world with high barriers to adaptation but low barriers to mitigation (due to slow economic growth); and SSP 5 is “Fossil-fueled development,” representing
> Solomon Hsiang and Robert E. Kopp 25

> 26 Journal of Economic Perspectives
> a world with high barriers to mitigation but low barriers to adaptation. Different combinations of SSPs and policy choices give rise to different global emission trajectories. For example, SSP 5 in the absence of policy measures can give rise to emissions consistent with RCP 8.5, but other SSPs would require carbon subsidies or similar policies to give rise to such high emissions. In all SSPs, emissions low enough to be consistent with RCPs 4.5 and 2.6 require carbon mitigation policy.
> The construction of these Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and the corre- sponding sets of RCP emissions scenarios represent the output of a modeling program coordinated across numerous research groups (Moss et al. 2010). The energy/agriculture/economic/climate integrated assessment models used to construct the scenarios are elaborate process models that have been assembled by interdisciplinary teams of engineers and economic modelers, mostly from energy economics. At the heart of most models are assumptions about exogenous popula- tion growth and about the rate and convergence of technical change. Researchers using these models have addressed many issues over the years: for example, the tradeoffs among different technologies and their roles in meeting different emis- sions targets (for example, Clarke et al. 2009).
> However, many economists with expertise that would be useful to these modeling exercises have remained unengaged with (or unaware of) this enter- prise. In our view, deepening engagements with economists in subfields outside of energy economics, such as macroeconomics, development economics, and polit- ical economy, will help strengthen and accelerate this research program (see also Barron 2018). Further, there should be a stronger emphasis on using empirical results and hindcasting experiments to constrain the behavior of these models (for example, Calvin, Wise, Kyle, Clarke, and Edmonds 2017).
> Focusing Climate Research to Support Investigation of Economic and Social Questions
> Much of climate science research is focused on answering key research ques- tions formulated by physical scientists about the nature of the global climate system. These questions are scientifically important and of substantial consequence, but in many cases, key questions or measurements about the climate system that are economically or socially important remain unanswered. We see three general areas where the potential gains from intellectual exchanges between climate scientists and economists seem large.
> First, empirically disentangling the economic consequences of climate change is a large research enterprise (discussed by Auffhammer in this symposium; for a summary, see Carleton and Hsiang 2016). Such analyses universally require some “data engineering” to map physical observations appropriately onto social systems (Auffhammer, Hsiang, Schlenker, and Sobel 2013; Hsiang 2016). Several advances in this literature have arisen from methodological innovations in how physical infor- mation from climate science has been summarized and integrated into theoretical and econometric models. For example, Schlenker and Roberts (2009) developed an approach for accounting for the accumulating effects of exposure to extreme heat; Hsiang (2010) developed a method for reconstructing continuous human

> exposure to tropical cyclones using standard, albeit limited, meteorological data; Hsiang, Meng, and Cane (2011) introduced a technique for identifying popula- tions heavily impacted by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation; and Proctor et al. (2018) developed an approach to isolate the optical effects of overhead volcanic aerosols. These innovations required both insight into the physics of the climate system coupled to insights from economists regarding the construction of economi- cally meaningful measures. Continued empirical progress will require deepening engagement between researchers in these two fields.
> Second, global intercomparison programs for climate change models specify outputs that modeling groups must record in order to participate, but in the past these outputs have been geared towards scientific questions rather than toward calculation of economic outcomes that result from climate change. For example, the expected future correlation of drought events across the major agricultural regions is likely to be important for future food prices, but statistics about such correlated extremes are not commonly computed (Kopp, Easterling, et al. 2017). By supplying the climate modeling community with information on what variables, patterns, and scales are of key economic interest, economists can help the climate modeling community synthesize and output their findings in new and useful ways.
> Finally, economists can aid climate scientists in identifying research questions that would be the most valuable to address from a socioeconomic perspective. For example, economists can help distinguish between those economic impacts for which it is most valuable to improve climate model resolution, and those for which is it more important to explore structural or parametric uncertainties, even if at lower resolu- tion. Economists can help distinguish between economic outcomes for which it is more important to constrain long-term climate sensitivity and those for which better characterization of short-term responses, natural variability, or spatial patterns is a priority. Economists can also identify new climate observations that would contribute the greatest value to improved risk-management strategies. In short, economists are well suited to support climate scientists by valuing the different types of information that these scientists could potentially provide to the world.
> Climate change management is an urgent and pervasive societal challenge. Natural scientists have had a century’s head start over economists in studying the topic, but at this point, input from social scientists can be especially productive. We hope this article can spur more economists to engage in this challenge.

**assistant**:
> In this section, the reading discusses various aspects of climate change and their potential economic and social implications. It highlights the following key points:
> 
> 1. Temperature Changes: Global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th century, with a greater increase over land compared to the oceans.
> 
> 2. "Hiatus" Period: The period of slowed average warming from 1998 to 2013, often referred to as the "hiatus," is attributed to natural variability and potential underrepresentation of volcanic and human aerosol emissions in models.
> 
> 3. Projected Temperature Increase: Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, global mean surface temperature is likely to rise by 0.9-5.4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2080-2100, depending on emissions scenarios.
> 
> 4. Precipitation Changes: Climate change affects precipitation patterns, with projections indicating increased heavy precipitation events and changes in regional rainfall patterns. The effects are complex and vary across locations.
> 
> 5. Humidity Changes: Specific humidity, a measure of moisture content in the air, has increased globally, while relative humidity shows little evidence of a trend. Changes in humidity can have implications for human health and heat stress.
> 
> 6. Tropical Cyclones: Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones and the average intensity of their associated rainfall. The total number of storms may remain stable or decrease, with regional variations.
> 
> 7. Sea-Level Rise: Global mean sea level has risen due to warming temperatures and melting land-based ice. Projections suggest varying levels of sea-level rise by 2100, which can have significant impacts on coastal areas and increase flood risk.
> 
> 8. Droughts and Floods: Climate change affects the frequency and intensity of extreme moisture conditions, leading to changes in droughts and floods. The impacts vary across regions and depend on factors such as local rainfall patterns and land use.
> 
> 9. Clouds: Cloud physics and their impact on climate change remain complex and uncertain. Cloud feedbacks can have both warming and cooling effects, and understanding cloud dynamics is important for studying climate change.
> 
> 10. Ecosystems: Climate change affects terrestrial and marine ecosystems, leading to shifts in species' distributions, coral reef degradation, changes in vegetation, and potential extinctions. These ecological changes have wide-ranging impacts.
> 
> 11. Tipping Elements: Certain components of the Earth system, called tipping elements, can undergo rapid shifts and reach critical thresholds when triggered. These include atmospheric circulation patterns, ice sheets, carbon cycles, and ecosystems.
> 
> The reading suggests that economists can contribute to climate science by improving emissions forecasts, focusing research on economic and social questions, and collaborating with climate scientists to identify valuable research areas and inform decision-making.
