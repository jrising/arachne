**assistant**:
> The Tolerance parameter used in QGIS's distance-based feature simplification tool represents the maximum distance a vertex can be moved from its original position during the simplification process. It is a measurement of the allowable error introduced by the simplification process.
> 
> Here's a brief explanation of how it works:
> 
> When you simplify a geometric feature (like a polygon or line), you essentially remove some of its points to create a less complex shape that approximates the original. The Tolerance parameter sets the threshold for which points can be removed or shifted, based on their distance from the original shape. 
> 
> For example, if you set a tolerance of 5 meters, no point will be moved more than 5 meters from its original position during simplification. This guarantees that the resulting simplified shape does not deviate from the original shape by more than the specified tolerance.
> 
> It's crucial to choose a suitable Tolerance value that maintains an acceptable level of detail while achieving the desired simplification. A small Tolerance will keep more points and preserve more detail, but result in less simplification. Conversely, a large Tolerance will remove more points and produce a simpler shape, but at the cost of accuracy and detail.

> What are the units of the tolerance value? I have a lat-lon map, but I don't think it's degrees since a value of 1 makes fairly small changes.
**assistant**:
> In QGIS's distance-based feature simplification tool, the tolerance value is typically specified in the linear unit of the coordinate system being used. 
> 
> If you are working with a lat-lon map, the coordinate system is most likely WGS84, which uses degrees as its unit. However, it's important to note that the tolerance value does not directly represent degrees because the Earth's surface is curved, and degrees of latitude and longitude do not have a consistent linear relationship.
> 
> If a tolerance value of 1 in QGIS's simplification tool is resulting in fairly small changes, it is probable that the tolerance value is being interpreted as linear units rather than degrees. This could mean that the map's coordinate system is not correctly set to WGS84, or that the tool is treating the tolerance value as a linear measurement.
> 
> To resolve this, you can ensure that your map's coordinate system is correctly set to WGS84, and then adjust the tolerance value based on the desired level of simplification in the specific unit you prefer (e.g., meters).
