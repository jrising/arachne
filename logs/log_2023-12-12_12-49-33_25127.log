> Reasons for a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware
> The global community is grappling with an escalating challenge: environmental degradation and
> resource depletion. Among these concerns, the issue of illegal small-scale mining, commonly
> known as “galamsey” in Ghana, has emerged as a critical environmental and socio-economic
> problem. As a passionate advocate for addressing the adverse effects of galamsey on my
> homeland, I am driven to pursue a graduate degree in Environmental Economics at the University
> of Delaware. In this essay, I will articulate my motivations for selecting this program, elucidate
> how I intend to tackle the galamsey issue through my studies, and explain why the University of
> Delaware is my chosen institution. Galamsey has emerged as one of Ghana’s most pressing
> environmental and economic challenges. This informal and illicit small-scale mining practice
> involves the extraction of precious minerals, particularly gold, without adherence to
> environmental regulations and sustainable mining practices. The repercussions of galamsey are
> multifaceted, spanning from deforestation and water pollution to land degradation and health
> hazards. Despite government efforts and policies, this issue continues to persist, underscoring
> the necessity for innovative and sustainable solutions.
> My motivation to study Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware is deeply rooted
> in my ardent desire to make a meaningful contribution to resolving the galamsey problem in
> Ghana. This program is renowned for its interdisciplinary approach, blending economics,
> environmental science, and policy analysis. Such an approach is imperative for a comprehensive
> understanding of and effective responses to complex environmental challenges like galamsey. The
> program aligns perfectly with my academic and career goals. The curriculum not only delves into
> the theoretical foundations of environmental economics but also places a strong emphasis on
> practical applications and policy development. This equilibrium between theory and practice will
> equip me with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively address intricate environmental
> challenges like galamsey. Furthermore, the University of Delaware boasts a distinguished faculty
> specializing in Environmental Economics, prominently featuring Prof. Leah Palm-Forster. Her
> research focus within Environmental and Natural Resource Economics closely aligns with my own
> interests. I initiated contact with Prof. Palm-Forster to express my eagerness for mentorship, and
> I am pleased to report her enthusiastic response, indicating her anticipation of reviewing my
> admission application. Her guidance and insights, and those of other distinguished faculty, are
> bound to prove invaluable as I endeavor to formulate effective strategies for addressing the
> environmental and socio-economic repercussions of galamsey.
> Through my enrollment in this graduate program, I aim to attain a comprehensive grasp of the
> underlying economic drivers fueling illegal small-scale mining and the attendant environmental
> ramifications. My intention is to harness advanced economic tools and methodologies to evaluate
> the true costs and benefits associated with illegal mining activities. This in-depth analysis will serve
> as the foundation for crafting innovative policy interventions designed not only to deter illegal
> mining but also to foster sustainable alternatives for affected communities.

> commitment for me. I am a young man from Ghana, and my achievement of being the first to
> complete high school and college marks a significant milestone for both my extended and nuclear

> tertiary institutions in Ghana using the University of Cape Coast as a case study. This is where I
> first became interested in research and a career in academia.
> After completing my bachelor's degree, I engaged in one year of national service as both a
> research and a teaching assistant at the School of Economics, University of Cape Coast. During
> this period, I played a pivotal role in various aspects of academic support. I contributed to research
> efforts by assisting in literature reviews, data collection, data entry, and data analysis. In the
> teaching realm, I worked closely with Dr. Benedict Afful, aiding in the instruction of subjects like
> Introductory Statistics, Industrial Economics, and Economics of Development. This included

> Oops, and I just noticed that the keywords for the research interests got dropped, and I forgot to mention that column in the table. I think most of what is currently in research proposal should be in a new research interests column, and then the "research proposal" column should just be mentioned keywords like "motivated", "literature", "methodology". Can you clean that up?
