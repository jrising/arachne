> But the timeout error doesn't work properly, because `as_completed` uses a global timeout-- so it doesn't impose it on the individual futures-- and that timeout gets thrown by  as_completed-- so the try-execpt doesn't catch it. How can I implement individual timeouts?
**assistant**:
> You're right that `concurrent.futures.as_completed` uses a global timeout for the whole group of futures, not individual ones. To impose an individual timeout on each future, you can use the `concurrent.futures.wait` function with a timeout parameter for each future. Here's a modified version of your function to accommodate individual timeouts:

**user**:

**assistant**:
> You are correct in your observation. When using futures in Python's ThreadPoolExecutor, futures can sit idle while waiting for available threads to execute their respective tasks, and the time of creation may not reflect the actual start of execution. To handle individual timeouts accurately without assuming that creation time equals the start time, you can use `concurrent.futures.TimeoutError` with a custom timer to keep track of individual timeouts for each future.

**user**:

**user**:
> Nope, the worker thread isn't providing its start time to the master. What is a thread-safe place where I can have each worker thread store its start-time?
**assistant**:
> To have each worker thread store its start time in a thread-safe manner, you can utilize thread-local storage provided by the `threading.local` module in Python. Thread-local storage allows you to create unique attributes for each thread, ensuring that the start time information is kept separate and accessible only within the relevant thread. Here's how you can modify your code to incorporate thread-local storage:

> import concurrent.futures
> import queue

> import time

> 1. The `threading.local()` object `thread_data` is used to provide thread-local storage for `start_time`.
> 2. Inside the `collect_feeds` function, each worker thread will store its start time in `thread_data.start_time` before executing the task.
> 3. The `collect_feed_worker` function is modified to store the start time of each thread in the thread-local storage.
> 4. The master thread can access the start time of each worker thread through the `thread_data` object, ensuring thread safety and accurate timeout management for individual tasks.
