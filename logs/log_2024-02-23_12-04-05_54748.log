**user**:
> How do I hide the little "a" that appears in a ggplot legend when I add a geom_label? The legend already has fill colors, from another ggplot geom command.
**assistant**:
> In ggplot, adding `geom_label` to a plot will indeed show an "a" in the legend. To hide the "a" from the legend while keeping other components, you would want to use the `show.legend = FALSE` argument in the `geom_label` function. Like this:
> 
> ```r
> ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
>   geom_bar(aes(fill = factor1), stat="identity") +
>   geom_label(aes(label = label_var), show.legend = FALSE) 
> ```
> 
> In this case, the "fill colors" legend for `geom_bar` will remain visible, but the "a" legend for `geom_label` will be hidden.
**user**:
> How do I move the legend to the bottom, so it shows up as a row across the bottom?
**assistant**:
> To move the legend to the bottom of a ggplot and display it as a row across the bottom, you can use the `theme` function in ggplot2. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:
> 
> ```r
> # Sample plot code
> ggplot(data, aes(x, y, fill = factor1)) +
>   geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
>   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
>   theme(legend.direction = "horizontal")
> ```
> 
> In this code snippet:
> - `theme(legend.position = "bottom")` moves the legend to the bottom of the plot.
> - `theme(legend.direction = "horizontal")` specifies that the legend items should be arranged horizontally.
> 
> You can adjust other aspects of the legend appearance using further theme options as needed.
