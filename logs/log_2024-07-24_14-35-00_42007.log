> I am looking for papers for a systematic meta-analysis  that are econometric studies of the effect of temperature variation on GDP growth. What search should I use to be comprehensive for a systematic review?
**assistant**:
> To comprehensively search for econometric studies examining the effect of temperature variation on GDP growth for a systematic meta-analysis, you should use a combination of database searching, keyword strategies, and citation tracking. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step strategy:
> 
> ### 1. Define Key Databases
> 
> - **Academic Databases**: JSTOR, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, SpringerLink.
> - **Economics-Specific Databases**: RePEc, EconLit.
> - **Climate Databases**: Climate Impact Lab, IPCC reports.
> 
> ### 2. Develop Keywords and Search Strings
> 
> Construct a list of keywords and search strings. Combine terms related to temperature, econometric analysis, and economic growth. Use Boolean operators (AND, OR) to structure your search.
> 
> **Keywords:**
> - Temperature variation
> - Climate change
> - Weather shocks
> - Econometric analysis
> - Regression
> - GDP growth
> - Economic impact
> - Causal inference
> - Panel data
> - Time series
> 
> **Example Search Strings:**
> - "temperature variation" AND "GDP growth" AND (econometric OR regression OR "panel data" OR "time series" OR "causal inference")
> - "climate change" AND "economic growth" AND (econometric OR regression OR "panel data" OR "time series" OR "causal inference")
> - "weather shocks" AND "economic impact" AND (econometric OR regression OR "panel data" OR "time series" OR "causal inference")
> 
> ### 3. Set Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
> Define clear criteria for selecting studies to ensure your review remains focused.
> 
> **Inclusion Criteria:**
> - Studies must use econometric methods.
> - Studies must examine the effect of temperature variation on GDP growth or economic performance.
> - Peer-reviewed articles, working papers, dissertations, and conference papers.
> - Studies published in English.
> 
> **Exclusion Criteria:**
> - Non-econometric studies.
> - Studies not focused on the economic impact of temperature change.
> - Articles not available in full text (if access is restricted).
> 
> ### 4. Conduct the Search
> Run your search strings across the chosen databases. Adjust the strings as necessary based on search results and refine keywords to capture relevant studies.
> 
> ### 5. Screen Results
> - **Title and Abstract Screening**: Initially screen articles based on titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant studies.
> - **Full-Text Screening**: Retrieve and review the full text of potentially relevant studies to apply inclusion and exclusion criteria more rigorously.
> 
> ### 6. Citation Tracking
> - **Forward and Backward Citation Search**: Use seminal papers to find additional relevant studies. Look at the references (backward) and use tools like Google Scholar for articles that cite the paper (forward).
> 
> ### 7. Keep Records
> - Use a reference management tool (e.g., EndNote, Mendeley, or Zotero) to keep track of your searches, screening process, and article selection.
> 
> ### Example Search Execution
> Here's an example of how you could set up your search:
> 
> 1. **JSTOR**:
>    ```markdown
>    Keywords: ("temperature variation" AND "GDP growth" AND (econometric OR regression OR "panel data" OR "time series" OR "causal inference"))
>    ```
>    
> 2. **ScienceDirect**:
>    ```markdown
>    Keywords: ("climate change" AND "economic growth" AND (econometric OR regression OR "panel data" OR "time series" OR "causal inference"))
>    ```
>    
> 3. **RePEc**:
>    ```markdown
>    Keywords: ("weather shocks" AND "economic impact" AND (econometric OR regression OR "panel data" OR "time series" OR "causal inference"))
>    ```
> 
> By carefully crafting your search strategy and utilizing a systematic approach, you can ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant literature for your meta-analysis.
