**assistant**:
> Yes, you can add a new variable to an xarray.Dataset by using the syntax `ds["name"] = x`, where `ds` is the Dataset, `"name"` is the key (variable name) you want to add, and `x` is the appropriately dimensioned DataArray. Note that I used square brackets and quotes around the variable name, as you should treat the Dataset like a dictionary in this case.
