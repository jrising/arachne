> I am very excited to apply to the Open Rank position in Global Governance for Sustainability, as a lateral move at the Assistant Professor level. Since its inception, a position at Stanford’s Doerr School of Sustainability has been a dream job for me. I believe that my research and other activities exhibit a compelling approach to global governance, and would be a good fit for the School’s mission and dovetailing with many of Stanford’s other strengths.
> 
> My research is on the interactions between economic and environmental systems and the policy opportunities to manage them. One branch of my research focuses on the quantitative analysis of the risks of climate change, including empirically estimating impacts, improving integrated models of climate policy, and grappling with risks that are currently missing from the economic discourse. In the other branch, I study the interactions between farmers and fishers and their environments, with an emphasis on spatial trade-offs. I am working to bring these together to better understand the future potential of our natural resources.
> 
> My work is broadly interdisciplinary, and I have also collaborated on research in conflict mitigation, urban access, water management, public health, and flood prediction. New techniques in complexity modeling and data science are a key thread in my research, and I have applied them to better understand the role of spatial organization and uncertainty in social-environmental systems.
> 
> Beyond my research, I have been an active member of the sustainable development community, coordinating stakeholder and interdisciplinary researcher workshops, which bring additional energy to my work and student interactions. I have been engaged in the work of closing gaps between academic work on climate risks and governance, by organizing grant-funded workshops, advising government and intergovernmental bodies (EPA, OMB, the UK’s CCC, and IPBES).
> 
> As my writing sample, I am including a recent article in Nature, the Missing risks of climate change. The perspective piece shows both my efforts to improve how research addresses climate risks to better support global governance, as well as my multidisciplinary, quantitative approach to these issues. I have also been published in PNAS, Science, QJE, and Global Environmental Change. My research statement explains the motivating themes behind my diverse research, and how I see them continuing to evolve in coming years.
> 
> Since participating in a student-teaching program at M.I.T., teaching both official and unofficial classes has been an important part of my career. At the University of Delaware, I have developed four courses on the analysis of complex systems, the economics of climate change, human-natural systems, and the philosophy of research.
> 
> I believe that a position in the Doerr School would be an excellent fit for my interests and experience, and look forward to connecting with you. Please feel free to reach me either by phone, at 1 202 657 2377, or by email, at jrising@udel.edu.

> My research delves into the intricate dynamics between economic and environmental systems, with a focus on identifying policy opportunities for their effective management. One aspect of my work involves the quantitative analysis of climate change risks, including empirical estimations of impacts, improvements to integrated climate policy models, and addressing currently overlooked risks within economic discussions. In the other facet of my research, I investigate the interactions between farmers, fishers, and their environments, emphasizing spatial trade-offs. Bridging these areas of study, my goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the future potential of our natural resources.

This article showcases both my commitment to enhancing research's contribution to global governance in addressing climate risks and my multidisciplinary, quantitative approach to these vital issues. Moreover, I have published in esteemed academic journals such as PNAS, Science, QJE, and Global Environmental Change. In my research statement, I outline the motivating themes driving my diverse research and articulate how I envision their future development.
