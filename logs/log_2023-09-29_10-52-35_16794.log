**user**:
> I have a CSV file with a column that contains "MULTIPOLYGON" points. How do I load this into QGIS as polygons?
**assistant**:
> Loading a CSV file with column containing "MULTIPOLYGON" points in QGIS involves a number of steps. Here is a step-by-step guide:
> 
> 1. First, convert your CSV file into a spatially recognized format, like a Shapefile or GeoJSON. This will be done through a GIS software or Python library like `geopandas`. Here's an example using Python:
> 
>     ```python
>     import geopandas as gpd
>     import pandas as pd
>     from shapely import wkt
> 
>     # Load your CSV
>     data = pd.read_csv('yourfile.csv')
> 
>     # Make sure the MULTIPOLYGON data are in WKT format
>     # Convert the 'multipolygon' column in data to geometry
>     data['geometry'] = data['multipolygon'].apply(wkt.loads)
> 
>     # Convert pandas DataFrame to GeoDataFrame
>     gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data, geometry='geometry')
> 
>     # Save this as a Shapefile (or GeoJSON)
>     gdf.to_file("output.shp")
>     ```
> 
> 2. After obtaining your shapefile (or GeoJSON), you can load this in QGIS.
> 
>    - On the toolbar, click `Layer` > `Add Layer` > `Add Vector Layer`.
>    - A new window will open. Click `Browse` and navigate to the saved shapefile (or GeoJSON), select the file and click `Open`. Then click `Add` in the `Data Source Manager | Vector` window.
> 
> Your polygons should now be visible in the QGIS canvas.
> 
> Just a note: The type of spatial object (point, line, polygon) is defined by you when you create the geometry. So make sure your WKT strings really represent MULTIPOLYGONS.
