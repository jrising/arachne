**user**:
> I'm finishing a hand written addendum to my Christmas letter for someone who loves puzzles and puns, writing "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and ...", and I want to end with an anagram of a pun. Do you have suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Of course, James! Here's a fun anagram of the phrase "fun puns" that fits in well with the puzzle theme: "Nun's Up F". It refers to "upping the fun", but in a puzzling and humorous way. So, you could complete your sentence as, "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and a full year of 'Nun's Up F'!" Remember, it might take a while for them to figure it out, but that's part of the fun, making it a gift within a gift!
