> Project Structure: NOWASTING integrates stakeholder engagement (WP1), climate impacts on crop and fisheries (WP2-3), economic decision-making (WP4), and nutrition and health (WP5). Stakeholders, including farmers and fishers, government officials, and NGO representatives, will be engaged throughout the process, but in particular in co-designing work under WP1 and WP5, and informing output metrics from WP2 - 5.
> 
> WP1 (Stakeholder Engagement) will organize workshops to develop environment and adaptation storylines. These will be used throughout the project, and in particular translated into concrete climate and socioeconomic scenarios for projections under WP2 - 3.
> 
> WP2 (Agriculture) and WP3 (Fisheries) will quantify changes in the productive capacity of staple crops and key fish species. 
> ===
> Now, I want to say that WP2-3 and WP1 will iterate to quantify a quite of ecosystem services: provision services from WP2-3, supporting services from WP1, but the final quantification of all of these will depend upon inputs from both WP1 and WP2-3. How can I say that?
**assistant**:
> Project Structure: Our project, NOWASTING, is designed as an iterative, interrelational framework that centers on stakeholder engagement (WP1), climate impacts on crops and fisheries (WP2-3), economic decision-making (WP4), and nutrition and health (WP5). Notably, each of our Work Packages (WP) closely interfaces with each other, creating synergy towards achieving our holistic sustainability goals.
> 
> WP1 ("Stakeholder Engagement") will organize workshops to co-develop environment and adaptation storylines with a diverse group of stakeholders, including farmers, fishers, government officials, and NGO representatives. These storylines, categorized under the umbrella of supporting ecosystem services, will inform and enhance the depth of our project's scope, serving as the basis for the socioeconomic scenarios utilized in WP2-3.
> 
> WP2 ("Agriculture") and WP3 ("Fisheries") will focus on provision services, quantifying changes in the productive capacity of staple crops and key fish species. 
> 
> In an innovative iteration process, WP1 and WP2-3 will collaboratively derive metrics for both supporting (from WP1) and provision (from WP2-3) ecosystem services. The final quantification of these services, crucially, will not occur in isolation, instead, it will be a product of the reciprocal integration of inputs from both WP1 and WP2-3. This method ensures that the full suite of ecosystem services are appropriately valued, echoing our commitment to comprehensive sustainability assessments.
> 
> The continuous involvement of stakeholders (especially in WP1 and WP5) and their contribution to shaping the output metrics from WP2 - 5, reinforces our interrelated ecosystem services approach, further solidifying the merits of our project structure.
