> The following is a paragraph from a grant proposal I am writing: 
> 
> We look at three levels of health outcomes: (Level 1) food quality and nutritional content; (Level 2) nutritional deficiencies; and (Level 3) anthropometric indicators and population-level health outcomes. Level 1 describes the market basket in terms of its calories and nutrients. Level 2 compares level 1 to nutrient needs and accounts for variability, dietary supplements, and poisoning risk, and looks at outcomes such as micronutrient deficiencies. Level 3 looks at how these nutrition gaps translate into anthropometric indicators, such as stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and underweight (low weight for age). Morbidity and mortality outcomes, including diarrhea, anemia, malaria, and heart disease will be included in the analysis. Population measures will be disaggregated as appropriate to analyze infant, child, and maternal health.

**assistant**:
> Here's a more succinct and streamlined version of your paragraph:
> 
> Our research dissects health outcomes on three levels: Quality of Food and Nutritional Content (`Level 1`), Nutritional Deficiencies (`Level 2`), and Manifested Health Outcomes (`Level 3`). `Level 1` defines the nutritional and caloric value of available food. `Level 2` measures this against nutrient requirements, considering factors such as diversity in diet, supplement intake, and risk of contamination. Here, we'll focus on outcomes like micronutrient deficiencies. `Level 3` examines how these gaps impact population-level health indicators, including stunting, wasting, and underweight occurrences, plus disease morbidity and mortality involving conditions like diarrhea, anemia, malaria, and heart disease. We'll disaggregate population data to specifically focus on health impacts amidst infants, children, and pregnant women.
