> I am Chamanthi, a Sri Lankan girl currently working as a graduate teaching assistant (demonstrator) at Uva Wellassa University of Sri Lanka after completing BSc (Hons) in Aquatic Resources Technology with a Second class upper division (GPA of 3.59/4.00) at the same University. I have two publications and research experience in marine ecology, Oceanography, Aquaculture, genetics, water quality, and fisheries management.
> 
>  
> 
> In my undergraduate period, I conducted my final year research project on the â€œLivelihood status of the fishing community of Mahakanadarawa reservoir in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka". While conducting this research, I found out the livelihood of the fishery community under social, human, physical, natural, and financial capitals. I found the length-weight relationship of Oreochromis niloticus along with its condition factor.

>  
> 
> I have been a part of research on the operation of a coal-fired power plant and its impact on adjoining marine environments and groundwater chemistry, with special reference to heavy metals. In this study, I focused on the power generation process, heavy metal analysis, and social and environmental impacts of the coal-fired power plant.
> 
>  
> 
> As a self-driven researcher, I possess a deep passion for furthering my studies in the realm of marine science, focusing on marine biology and marine ecology with a solid background in ecotoxicology, oceanography, and marine conservation applications in environmental science. As such, I would be incredibly glad if you could kindly offer me a position as a PhD/MSc researcher in your research group, allowing me to expand my knowledge in this subject while also contributing to the work done at the University of Delaware.

**assistant**:
> Dear James,
> 
> It appears that Chamanthi is interested in furthering her studies in marine science, specifically focusing on marine biology and marine ecology with an emphasis on ecotoxicology, oceanography, and marine conservation. The inquiry does not specify a preference between a PhD and a MSc degree, which suggests she may be open to either.
> 
> Based on her research interests and academic background, she seems to have strong interpersonal skills and experience in conducting research in marine ecology and oceanography. These traits would likely make her a good fit for the PhD in Marine Policy program or the Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program with a Marine track. 
> 
> It's worth noting that she has worked on a diverse field of projects, from the livelihoods of fishing communities to the environmental impacts of a coal-fired power plant, which points to an interdisciplinary approach that aligns well with the ESM program. 
> 
> Chamanthi did not mention attending a university in the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, nor did her curriculum vitae indicate that she attended MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD. 
> 
> Therefore, a suitable response could go along the following lines:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Chamanthi,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your experience and interdisciplinary research interests in marine science, particularly in marine biology, oceanography, and ecotoxicology, would make you a strong candidate for our PhD in Marine Policy program or our Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program.
> 
> Please note that our Masters in Marine Policy program transitioned to the exciting new [Environmental Science & Management program](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/) that also offers a Marine track. 
> 
> Both programs generally have limited funding, and it would be wise to apply early within the application period, which would typically offer the best chance for any available funding. 
> 
> If you choose to apply to the PhD in Marine policy, please consider including how your research interests align with my own, specifically climate change risks, food systems and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling, in your statement of purpose.
