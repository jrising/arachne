**assistant**:
> To replace all instances of the string "enerfrac" with "soc" in `.jl` files in a directory on a Mac, you can use the `sed` command in the Terminal. Here's a step-by-step guide:
> 
> 1. **Open Terminal**: You can open Terminal by searching for it using Spotlight (Cmd + Space) or by navigating to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.
> 
> 2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change to the directory containing your `.jl` files. For instance:
>    ```bash
>    cd /path/to/your/directory
>    ```
>    Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path to your folder.
> 
> 3. **Run the `sed` Command**: Execute the following command to replace "enerfrac" with "soc" in all `.jl` files:
>    ```bash
>    sed -i '' 's/enerfrac/soc/g' *.jl
>    ```
> 
>    Explanation of the command:
>    - `sed`: The stream editor.
>    - `-i ''`: This flag tells `sed` to make an in-place edit, which directly modifies the file. The `''` is required on macOS for compatibility reasons and specifies that no backup of the original file will be made (if you want to keep a backup, use `-i '.bak'`).
>    - `'s/enerfrac/soc/g'`: This is the substitution command, where `s` stands for substitute. It replaces all instances (`g` stands for global) of "enerfrac" with "soc".
>    - `*.jl`: This specifies that the command should be applied to all files ending with `.jl`.
> 
> 4. **Check Your Files**: Once the command completes, you may want to check a couple of files to ensure the replacement was successful.
