> What is a good textbook for me to learn input-output modeling, getting up to an advanced level (so, lots of linear algebra)?
**assistant**:
> Great choice to go in-depth into Input-Output (I/O) modeling, James. Given your desire for a text with an emphasis on linear algebra, I'd recommend:
> 
> 1. **"Input-Output Analysis: Foundations and Extensions"** by Ronald E. Miller and Peter D. Blair. This book is renowned as a comprehensive and accessible introduction to modern input-output analysis. It provides a systematic account of the foundations of input-output analysis, model formulation and interpretation. The linear algebraic approach is well-integrated and explanations of key algebraic operations are provided.
> 
> 2. **"Inputâ€“Output Economics"** by Wassily Leontief. As the Nobel laureate who developed the input-output analysis, Leontief provides the foundational premises of the model with a mathematically intensive bent. This book is a historical and foundational text.
> 
> For an emphasis on matrix operations and theorem proofs, you may want to delve into:
> 
> 3. **"Matrix Methods in Economics"** by Ichiro Takayama. Though not solely focused on I/O models, this book provides extensive linear algebra tools relevant to the field.
> 
> Remember, even for a skilled mathematician, the richest understanding comes from pairing linear algebra knowledge with good old economic intuition. These books do a good job of straddling both worlds. Happy learning!
