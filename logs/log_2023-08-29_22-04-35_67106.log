> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. The majority of passenger transport is represented by the Cape May-Lewes Ferry. About 13% of passenger boats pass through Delaware waters and the rest enter the Bay. There are only two enterprises dedicated to deep sea passenger transportation in Delaware.

> "Delaware marine waters play a disproportional role in passenger transport, with a sizeable representation by the Cape May-Lewes Ferry. Interestingly, approximately 13% of all passenger boats make their transit through Delaware's waters, while the remainder journey into the broader expanse of the Bay. Despite this significant marine activity, for those seeking deeper water transportation, options are relatively sparse. Only two enterprises currently dedicate their efforts to facilitating deep sea passenger transportation within Delaware. Such a divergence between local and deep-sea options indicates a potential area for further exploration and development within the state's maritime sector."

> 
> Carrying more than a quarter of a million cars and three-quarters of a million people in a typical year, the Ferry System promotes tourism, trade and economic development.
> Data showed that every dollar of net expenditure on the Ferry System stimulates twenty dollars of economic activity.
> In addition to the economic study, the Ferry has conducted monthly passenger surveys each year since 2015 to monitor passenger trends. This data shows that ferry passengers spend a minimum of $125 million annually at Delaware Beaches and $144 million annually at the South Jersey Shore towns between Cape May and Atlantic City. Less than 1 in 20 passengers report driving through the area without stopping for something even if just for gas or take-out.

> Certainly! Here's an expanded paragraph that incorporates the additional information from the economic impact study on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry:
> 
> "Delaware's passenger transportation landscape boasts a notable player in the form of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, which carries a significant volume of cars and passengers. In a typical year, the Ferry System facilitates the transportation of over a quarter of a million cars and three-quarters of a million individuals, thereby actively promoting tourism, trade, and economic development within the region. An economic impact study revealed that the Ferry System generates substantial economic activity, with every dollar of net expenditure on the system resulting in a stimulating effect of twenty dollars on the overall economy. To further emphasize the economic significance of the Ferry, monthly passenger surveys conducted since 2015 have consistently demonstrated the substantial financial contributions made by ferry passengers to the local economy. These surveys indicate that annually, passengers spend at least $125 million at Delaware Beaches and an additional $144 million at the South Jersey Shore towns between Cape May and Atlantic City. Remarkably, less than 1 in 20 passengers report driving through the area without making a stop, even if it's just for gas or take-out. This data not only underscores the economic impact of the Ferry System but also highlights its profound influence on the local business ecosystem."

Monthly passenger surveys conducted since 2015 demonstrate the financial impact of ferry passengers, with an estimated minimum annual spending of $125 million at Delaware Beaches and $144 million at South Jersey Shore towns. The surveys also indicate that almost all passengers make stops in the area, emphasizing the Ferry System's role in stimulating local businesses and driving economic growth."
