**user**:
> What does a little circle between two function symbols in math mean?
**assistant**:
> The little circle between two functions in math, denoted as "∘" or simply "o", refers to function composition.
> 
> If we have two functions, f and g, their composition (f ∘ g)(x) is the function defined by (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)). In other words, you apply the function g to the input x, then you apply the function f to that result. This operation is not commutative; f ∘ g is generally not the same as g ∘ f.
**user**:
> What would I call it if I want to compute f(g)(x). That is, f takes a function as its argument, and returns a new function, which then takes x?
**assistant**:
> The process of computing f(g)(x), where f takes a function as its argument and returns a new function, which then takes x, is called function composition as well.
> 
> In this case, f is a higher-order function that takes g as an argument and returns a new function. This new function, obtained by applying f to g, can be evaluated by supplying it with the value x. Essentially, it's a composition of two functions: first applying g to x, and then applying f to the result.
> 
> You could refer to this as the composition of a higher-order function with a regular function or as the chaining of functions. It allows you to combine functions in a flexible and powerful way, enabling you to create new functions that encapsulate complex operations.
**user**:
> Is function composition of this form denoted the same way-- with a dot? Even though it describes doing something different?
**assistant**:
> No, function composition of the form you described, where f takes a function as its argument and returns a new function, is not typically denoted with a dot. Instead, it is often denoted using parentheses or other functional notation.
> 
> One common way to denote this kind of function composition is by using functional notation and parentheses. For example, you could represent f(g)(x) as f(g(x)). In this notation, you first evaluate the function g on the input x to get a result, and then apply the function f to that result.
> 
> Another way to represent this kind of function composition is using lambda notation or anonymous functions. For example, you might write f(g)(x) as (λy. f(g(y)))(x). In this notation, the lambda function (λy. f(g(y))) represents the function that takes y as an argument and applies the composition of f and g to it.
> 
> It's important to note that the dot notation, such as f ∘ g, is typically reserved for the composition of two regular functions, not for higher-order functions that take functions as arguments and return new functions.
