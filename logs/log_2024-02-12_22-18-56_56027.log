> What is the equation for an Archimedean spiral, parameterized by `t`, so that the distance from one point to another (say `t` to `t + 1`) is the same all the way along the spiral?
**assistant**:

> However, the specific condition you've set can't be perfectly met by either an Archimedean or logarithmic spiral. If you want equal distances between subsequent points as you move along the spiral, you wind up with a different sort of spiral entirely, which isn't as easily parameterizable. This is because the differential arc length (the distance between infinitesimally close points along the spiral) of these two common types of spirals does not remain constant but depends on the position along the spiral.
