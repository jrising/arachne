> The standard error of a function of estimated parameters, such as the marginal effect in your example, would typically be calculated using the Delta method. The Delta method gives an approximation for the variance of a function of random variables, and it's often used for inferring about functions of estimated parameters.

> For your model, the marginal effect is a function: g(β) = β1 + 2 * β2 * T. If we take the variance-covariance matrix of the underlying parameters to be represented by Σ (a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are the variances of the estimates, and the off-diagonal elements are the covariances), then the variance of this marginal effect can be approximated using the Delta method as follows:
> 
> Var[g(β)] ≈ (∇g)^T * Σ * ∇g
