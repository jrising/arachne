> What is a more science-y way to describe "limited substituability" between economic and natural goods?  This should be related to natural capital and strong sustainability.
**assistant**:
> A more science-y way to describe "limited substitutability" between economic and natural goods could be "low elasticity of substitution between natural and manufactured capital." This concept is central to strong sustainability, which posits that natural capital—the world's stocks of natural assets—cannot be simply replaced or substituted by human-made capital without loss of essential ecological functions. Therefore, strong sustainability asserts the necessity of maintaining adequate stocks of natural capital to ensure ecological integrity and the long-term viability of ecosystems.

> I meant "natural sciency". Limited substitutability and elasticity of substitution are both economics-y terms, which will not play well with non-economics audiences.
**assistant**:
> Got it! In a more science-oriented context, you could describe "limited substitutability" as "restricted interchangeability" between ecological and economic resources. This emphasizes that certain natural goods—like clean air, biodiversity, and stable ecosystems—cannot be effectively replaced by human-made goods.

> "The capacity to substitute economic goods for natural resources is limited, highlighting the critical role of natural capital in maintaining ecological balance and supporting life. This underscores the necessity of preserving natural ecosystems, as their unique functions cannot be replicated by manufactured alternatives."

> This phrasing connects effectively to concepts of natural capital and strong sustainability while remaining accessible to a broader audience.
