**user**:
> Is the NIH's "Dietary Reference Intakes" dataset appropriate for West Africa, or is there something more appropriate for evaluating nutrient gaps?
**assistant**:
> The National Institutes of Health's "Dietary Reference Intakes" (DRI) dataset provides valuable reference data on the nutrient intakes required to avoid deficiency diseases and maintain overall health. However, this dataset is based on data from U.S. and Canadian populations and may not fully reflect the unique dietary and nutritional circumstances prevalent in West Africa.
> 
> For West Africa specifically, you might want to consider the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) project data, facilitated by USAID. This project developed Food and Nutrition Surveillance Systems in several African countries and provides country-specific dietary reference intakes.
> 
> Another resource could be the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) "West African Food Composition Table". It can provide data on the nutrient composition of foods frequently consumed in West Africa, which could help you assess nutrient gaps.
> 
> Similarly, the World Health Organization's (WHO) "Nutrient Profile Model For the WHO African Region" can also provide useful data on nutrient profiles in the African context.
> 
> Remember, any data needs to be considered in the context of local dietary habits, food availability, cultural preferences, and socio-economic factors. For more nuanced perspectives, it could also be valuable to consult research studies on nutrition and dietary habits conducted specifically in West African contexts. 
> 
> It may also be necessary to link with health ministries or nutrition research centers in the specific West African countries you're interested in, or enlist the help of organizations that perform fieldwork. Journal articles and reports that analyze food and nutrient intake in the region can also be very useful.
> 
> Once you have settled on your data source, be sure to take into account any differences in dietary practices between rural and urban areas, different ethnic groups, and across different regions within the same country.
