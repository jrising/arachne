> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. I have a section on habitats and I would like to add a paragraph describing two related habitat types: shoals and coral habitats. Shoals are near short, coral habitat is along the canyons of the continental shelf (stony coral higher up and soft coral lower down). Below are descriptions of the underlying datasets:
> 
> Modeled Shoals
> These data are a combination of modeled shoal features that were produced by NOAA for the Shoal Map Assessment Tool for Essential Fish Habitat (ShoalMATE) as well as BOEM sand resources polygons from the Marine Minerals Information System (MMIS). The geospatial assessment used to produce the modeled shoal features solely focused on areas seaward of the U.S. Submerged Lands Act Boundary to a depth of 50 meters (from NOAA Coastal Relief Model) in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. Modeled shoal features are distinguished from BOEM Sand Resource areas by their study ID (shoalMATE). Much of the attribution that characterizes each feature comes from the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). For more information about how the modeled shoal features were generated, see OCS Study BOEM 2020-002 and NCCOS Technical Memorandum 270.

> Deep-Sea Stony Coral Habitat Suitability
> Deep-sea corals, also known as cold water corals, create complex communities that provide habitat for a variety of invertebrate and fish species, such as grouper, snapper, and sea bass. This data set depicts the relative likelihood of finding suitable habitat for stony corals at a given location and is a prediction based on a statistical model relating several environmental characteristics to the presence of stony corals using observations of stony coral. Stony corals form calcium-based skeletons and structures that have habitat value for other species. Shallow-water stony corals form the reefs that we are familiar with. Predictions from these habitat suitability models can be used to support conservation and management of deep-sea corals and to assist with targeting areas for mapping and exploration.

> Deep-Sea Soft Coral Habitat Suitability
> Deep-sea corals, also known as cold water corals, create complex communities that provide habitat for a variety of invertebrate and fish species, such as grouper, snapper, and sea bass. This data set depicts the relative likelihood of finding suitable habitat for soft corals at a given location and is a prediction based on a statistical model relating several environmental characteristics to the presence of soft corals using observations of soft coral. Soft corals, unlike stony corals, do not form calcium-based skeletons. A common example of a soft coral is a sea fan. Predictions from these habitat suitability models can be used to support conservation and management of deep-sea corals and to assist with targeting areas for mapping and exploration.

**assistant**:
> Sure, I'm happy to assist you in summarizing this information. Here's the paragraph for your report:
> 
> Delaware marine waters host a variety of diverse habitats, two of which are the shoals and coral regions. The shoals are primarily identified based on a combination of modeled shoal features generated by NOAA for the Shoal Map Assessment Tool for Essential Fish Habitat (ShoalMATE) as well as BOEM sand resources footprints from the Marine Minerals Information System (MMIS), focusing on areas seaward of the U.S. Submerged Lands Act Boundary up to a depth of 50 meters. Each feature's characteristics build on the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) and are distinct from BOEM Sand Resource areas through their study ID (shoalMATE) (see OCS Study BOEM 2020-002 and NCCOS Technical Memorandum 270 for more details).

> In contrast, along the continental shelf's canyons, one can find deep-sea coral habitats, including both stony and soft coral communities. The former is distinguished by forming calcium-based skeletons, while the latter, exampled by sea fans, does not exhibit this trait. These communities, also known as cold-water corals, provide habitat for various invertebrates and fish species like grouper, snapper, and sea bass. Their relative presence at a location is modeled using environmental characteristics and observed data of corals. The existence of these reliable models enables targeted conservation and management efforts towards these valuable but often under-recognized habitats.

> Can you summarize this into a paragraph about half the length?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a shorter summary paragraph:
> 
> Delaware's marine waters harbor diverse habitats, including shoals and coral regions. Shoals are areas seaward of the U.S. Submerged Lands Act Boundary, characterized by features generated through modeling and identified with the Shoal Map Assessment Tool for Essential Fish Habitat (ShoalMATE). On the other hand, the canyons of the continental shelf are home to deep-sea corals, both stony and soft. Stony corals, forming calcium-based skeletons, create complex communities that support various invertebrates and fish species. Soft corals, like sea fans, offer habitat without calcium-based structures. Predictive models based on environmental characteristics aid in identifying suitable habitat for these corals, assisting with conservation and targeted mapping efforts.
