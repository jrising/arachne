> My ancestor, James Rising, traveled from London to Bermuda in 1635 on a ship called the Dorset. He was probably going there along with other indentured servants to work the tobacco fields. What kind of ship would the Dorset have been?
**assistant**:
> In the early 17th century, transatlantic voyages from England to the Americas, including destinations like Bermuda, were typically undertaken by relatively small sailing ships. There are a few possibilities regarding the type of ship the "Dorset" might have been:
> 
> 1. **Caravel**: While caravels were more common during the earlier Age of Discovery, some may still have been in use by 1635. They are known for their maneuverability and effectiveness in long voyages.
> 
> 2. **Fluyt**: This Dutch design was widely adopted in Europe for its large cargo capacity and efficient use of resources, making it a common merchant vessel during the 17th century.
> 
> 3. **Barque or Bark**: Though traditionally referring to a specific rigging of ships, "barque" was often used more generically in the 17th century to describe medium-sized sailing vessels.
> 
> By 1635, most ships making such journeys would have been equipped with multiple masts and square sails, designed for ocean travel and carrying both passengers and cargo. Given the context of carrying indentured servants, the "Dorset" was likely a ship designed for transporting both people and goods, possibly a fluyt or similar merchant vessel. These ships were often crowded and spartan, focused on maximizing space for cargo and the transportation of passengers for profit.
**user**:
> If it was a Fluyt, how many masts would it have had?
**assistant**:
> A typical fluyt usually had **two masts**. The main mast carried a square sail, while the smaller foremast often had a triangular sail (a foresail). This rigging made fluyts efficient for trade and navigation, allowing for greater cargo capacity and improved maneuverability compared to other ships of similar size at that time. Depending on the specific design, some fluyts might also have carried additional sails on the masts for improved speed and handling, but the standard configuration was generally two masts.
