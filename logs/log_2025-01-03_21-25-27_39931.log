**user**:
> How can I get a formatted listing of all of the files in a given directory tree in python?
**assistant**:
> To get a formatted listing of all the files in a given directory tree in Python, you can utilize the `os` module which provides a way to interact with the operating system, particularly `os.walk()`, which is very handy for traversing directory trees. Below is an example code snippet that demonstrates how you can achieve this:
> 
> ```python
> import os
> 
> def list_files_in_directory_tree(root_dir):
>     for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_dir):
>         # Print the current directory path
>         print(f'Directory: {dirpath}')
>         # Print sub-directories
>         if dirnames:
>             print(f'\tSubdirectories: {", ".join(dirnames)}')
>         # Print filenames
>         for filename in filenames:
>             print(f'\tFile: {filename}')
> 
> # Specify the directory you want to list the files from
> directory_to_scan = '/path/to/your/directory'
> list_files_in_directory_tree(directory_to_scan)
> ```
> 
> This script will print out all the directories and the files under each directory in the tree starting from the specified root directory. The output is a simple console print, but you can format it further or write it to a file if needed.
> 
> If you prefer a more high-level and visually appealing output, you might consider using third-party libraries like `rich`, which allows for more sophisticated formatting:
> 
> ```python
> from rich.tree import Tree
> from rich.console import Console
> import os
> 
> def build_directory_tree(root_dir):
>     dir_tree = Tree(root_dir)
>     for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_dir):
>         if dirnames or filenames:
>             sub_tree = dir_tree
>             parts = dirpath[len(root_dir):].strip(os.sep).split(os.sep)
>             for part in parts:
>                 if part:
>                     sub_tree = sub_tree.children[-1]
> 
>             for dirname in dirnames:
>                 sub_tree.add(dirname, style='bold blue')
>             for filename in filenames:
>                 sub_tree.add(filename, style='')
> 
>     return dir_tree
> 
> # Initialize console
> console = Console()
> # Specify the directory you want to list the files from
> directory_to_display = '/path/to/your/directory'
> # Build tree and display
> console.print(build_directory_tree(directory_to_display))
> ```
> 
> This version makes use of the `rich` library to display a tree-like structure in the console. Just make sure to have `rich` installed in your environment (`pip install rich`).
**user**:
> What about just a list of all of the files in the directory tree, with their relative paths?
**assistant**:
> If you just want a simple list of all files in a directory tree with their relative paths, you can again use `os.walk()`. Below is a Python code snippet that accomplishes this task:
> 
> ```python
> import os
> 
> def list_all_files(root_dir):
>     file_list = []
>     for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_dir):
>         for filename in filenames:
>             # Get the relative path and append to the list
>             relative_path = os.path.relpath(os.path.join(dirpath, filename), root_dir)
>             file_list.append(relative_path)
>     return file_list
> 
> # Specify the directory you want to scan
> directory_to_scan = '/path/to/your/directory'
> all_files = list_all_files(directory_to_scan)
> 
> # Print the list of files with relative paths
> for file in all_files:
>     print(file)
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation
> 1. **`os.walk(root_dir)`**: This function generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up.
> 2. **`os.path.join(dirpath, filename)`**: Combines the directory path and filename to create a full path to the file.
> 3. **`os.path.relpath()`**: Computes the relative file path from the specified root directory.
> 
> ### Output
> The output will be a simple list of file paths relative to the specified root directory. For example:
> 
> ```
> subdir1/file1.txt
> subdir2/file2.txt
> file3.txt
> ```
> 
> Feel free to adjust the `directory_to_scan` variable to the directory you want to check!
