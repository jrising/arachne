> I previously asked for some information extracted from a document:
> ---
> Activity Name: Waste Dump Sites
> Description: There are former dump sites, some of which contain hazardous materials. These are places that received materials such as municipal sewage sludge, acid waste, and explosives. There is also a potential residual mine dump area.
> Current Status: These are discontinued dump sites. However, their existence may still pose challenges for development activities such as turbine installations and cable-laying.
> Spatial Extent: The study mentions three locations, distributed from west to east, and an additional one near the Delaware North and South firing ranges. More specific details could be obtained from the referenced NOAA Chart (Map 44) and USACE Environmental Assessment.
> Temporal Pattern: Not specified in the provided excerpt.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: There’s no mention of any potential changes or expansion of these sites since they are already discontinued.
> Stakeholders: Developers, resource managers, environmentalists, potentially nearby communities due to health and safety concerns.
> Sources: NOAA Navigational Charts, USACE Environmental Assessment (USACE, 2000).
> Other notes: Special precautions must be taken in these areas due to potential health and safety concerns.
> 
> Activity Name: Submarine Cables
> Description: There are undersea cables and pipelines installed in the past for telecommunication, oil and gas. Some are operational, while others are non-operational.
> Current Status: Submarine cables are a mixture of operational and non-operational lines. The majority of hazardous cables are in the eastern section of the study area.
> Spatial Extent: Specific data about their placement would be available from the referenced Multipurpose Marine Cadastre (BOEM-NOAA, 2011) and NOAA’s Electronic Navigation Charts (Map 44).
> Temporal Pattern: Not specified in the provided excerpt.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Identification and charting of submerged cables, particularly privately and government-owned ones not currently charted, is an area for future development and research.
> Stakeholders: Telecommunication companies, oil and gas companies, developers, and various government entities.
> Sources: Multipurpose Marine Cadastre (BOEM-NOAA, 2011), NOAA’s Electronic Navigation Charts.
> Other notes: Due to inaccuracies in charting and the presence of uncharted cables, it’s critical to properly identify all cables for future development activities.
> 
> Activity Name: Construction of Undersea Electricity Transmission Hub and Subsea High-voltage Transmission Line
> 
> Description: These facilities are designed to transport marine-based renewable energy to the shore, potentially connecting up to 7,000 MW of power through HVDC transmission lines. The hub intends to make few landings on shore to minimize the number of necessary landfalls to bring offshore energy to the grid. Currently, the hub is specifically mentioned as a key consideration for the siting of offshore wind projects to minimize disruptions.
> 
> Current Status: Plans for construction have been put forward by Trans-Elect and Atlantic Grid Development with a schematic published, but the report does not specify whether construction has begun.
> 
> Spatial Extent: The connection points are revealed to be at southern Delaware specifically at Indian River plus other locally relevant connection points at Piney Grove (Maryland) and Cardiff (New Jersey).
> 
> Temporal Pattern: Specific details about timing or stages are not given in the section provided.
> 
> Potential Expansion/Changes: There’s a possibility of more such hubs/substations to increase grid connectivity as offshore wind power generation grows.
> 
> Stakeholders: Atlantic Wind Connection (project owners), Trans-Elect, Atlantic Grid Development, and potentially Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey (as points of connections).
> 
> Sources: Information cited comes from the Atlantic Wind Connection and their “Right of Way Request” document from 2011.
> 
> Other notes: Cable locations, on-shore tie-ins, and the five distinct phases of installation can be sourced from a PDF map available for download from the AWC website.
> 
> Activity Name: Utilization of Substation Points for Small-scale Development
> 
> Description: Multiple small substation points are identified that could be used for the development of smaller-scale projects, generating between 50 to 100 MW of power.
> 
> Current Status: The report doesn’t specifically state whether these small-scale development projects have been initiated.
> 
> Spatial extent: This applies to several small substation points located on land – potentially in Delaware based on the information provided.
> 
> Temporal Pattern: No specific details about timing or stages are given in the section provided.
> 
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Depending on the success of smaller-scale projects, there may be an expansion to other substation points in the future.
> 
> Stakeholders: Not explicitly stated, but we can expect the Delaware government, local power companies, and perhaps independent power producers would be involved.
> 
> Sources: The information refers to the Atlantic Wind Connection’s 2011 works and plans.
> 
> Other notes: For larger projects, a substation tie-in at Indian River is identified as likely, providing connection for the proposed Atlantic Wind Connection.
