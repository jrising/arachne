**user**:
> I have a CSV table with latitudes and longitudes. How can read this in python, find the closest point to a given location, and then also identify the other information in that row of the table?
**assistant**:
> Here's a general way to do this using the `pandas` library for handling the CSV file, the `geopy` library for handling geographic distance calculations, and a little bit of basic Python for finding the closest location. This approach assumes the CSV file has columns named 'Latitude', 'Longitude', and 'Name' but you can easily replace these with the appropriate column names.
> 
> First, install the necessary libraries:
> 
> ```python
> pip install pandas geopy
> ```
> 
> Then, you can use the following code:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> from geopy import distance
> 
> # Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
> df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file.csv')
> 
> # Function to calculate the distance to the input location
> def calculate_distance(row, input_location):
>     row_location = (row['Latitude'], row['Longitude'])
>     return distance.distance(row_location, input_location).km
> 
> # Provide the location you want to find closest to.
> input_location = (input_latitude, input_longitude)
> 
> # Add a new column with the distance to the input location
> df['Distance'] = df.apply(calculate_distance, axis=1, args=(input_location,))
> 
> # Find the row with the closest location.
> closest_location_row = df.loc[df['Distance'].idxmin()]
> 
> # Print the details of this row.
> print(closest_location_row)
> ```
> 
> Replace 'path_to_your_file.csv' with the path to your CSV file and replace `input_latitude` and `input_longitude` with the latitude and longitude of your specified location. 
> 
> This will print all the information in the CSV row of the location closest to the given `input_location`, including the distance to it. The closest location is determined by its smallest geographical distance to the input location.
