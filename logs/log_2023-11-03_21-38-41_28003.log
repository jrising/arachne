**user**:
> I have some dplyr code, of the form:
> df %>% group_by(ISO) %>% summarize(MANY_THINGS)
> 
> I would like to take the summarize(MANY_THINGS) and put it into a function, since I use that same code in several places. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, it's a great practice to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Here's how you can put your `summarize()` call into a function:
> 
> ```R
> # Define the function
> summarize_many_things <- function(df) {
>   df %>% summarize(MANY_THINGS)
> }
> 
> # Use the function
> df %>% group_by(ISO) %>% summarize_many_things()
> ```
> 
> This function should take any data frame and conduct whatever `summarize` operation(s) you specify in `MANY_THINGS`. If you use this pattern in multiple places in the code, it makes your program easier to modify and understand.
> 
> Remember to replace `MANY_THINGS` with the actual operations you want to conduct in `summarize`, such as `mean(x)`, `sum(y)`, etc. You only have to specify this in `summarize_many_things` then.
> 
> Also, this function is specific to the pipeline that starts with `group_by(ISO)`. If you have other groupings or another pipeline using the same summarization, you could pass the grouping variable as a parameter to make the function more general. Feel free to ask if you want to see an example of how it would look.
**user**:
> Is there a way to generalize the names of the columns in MANY_THINGS? So, the logic would be the same, but the column names might be different in the various df's I pass in.
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can generalize the column names in the `summarize()` call by passing them as arguments to the `summarize_many_things()` function. Here's an updated version of the function:
> 
> ```R
> summarize_many_things <- function(df, ...) {
>   df %>% summarize(...)
> }
> ```
> 
> In this updated version, the `...` is called ellipsis and allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to the function. These arguments represent the column names or variables you want to summarize.
> 
> When using the `summarize_many_things()` function, you can specify the column names dynamically:
> 
> ```R
> df %>% group_by(ISO) %>% summarize_many_things(MEAN_COLUMN = mean(x), SUM_COLUMN = sum(y))
> ```
> 
> Here, `MEAN_COLUMN` and `SUM_COLUMN` are the generic names for the resulting columns, and `x` and `y` are the specific column names in your data frame. You can customize them as needed for each use case.
> 
> This way, you can reuse the `summarize_many_things()` function with different column names in different data frames while preserving the logic of the summarization.
**user**:
> Except that this removes the benefit of using the function. Because most of the stuff in MANY_THINGS will be the same, just the column names will differ.
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the misunderstanding. If most of the code in `MANY_THINGS` remains the same, with only the column names varying, you can pass the column names as strings and use them dynamically within the `summarize_many_things()` function. Here's an updated approach:
> 
> ```R
> summarize_many_things <- function(df, ...) {
>   df %>% summarize(across(all_of(...), .fns = list(MANY_THINGS)))
> }
> ```
> 
> In this version, the `...` represents the column names as strings. The `all_of()` function is used to convert the column name strings to symbols that can be evaluated within `summarize()`. The `MANY_THINGS` reference remains the same, assuming it contains the common operations you want to apply to the specified columns.
> 
> When using the `summarize_many_things()` function, pass the column names as a character vector:
> 
> ```R
> df %>% group_by(ISO) %>% summarize_many_things("MEAN_COLUMN", "SUM_COLUMN")
> ```
> 
> Here, `"MEAN_COLUMN"` and `"SUM_COLUMN"` are the specific column names you want to summarize. You can customize them for each use case while reusing the common logic specified in `MANY_THINGS`.
> 
> Please let me know if this approach aligns with your requirements or if you have any further questions.
