**user**:
> In jquery, I have some html returned by an ajax request. Now I want to wrap it in a ul tag and then append it to an element. How do I do that?
**assistant**:
> In jQuery, you can wrap your HTML content within a `ul` tag and append it to an element using the `append()` method. Below is an example, supposing that your AJAX request returns an HTML string saved in a variable named `html_data`.
> 
> ```javascript
> // This is assuming your ajax request returns an html string saved in `html_data`
> var html_data = "<li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li>"; // Your HTML content
> 
> // Wrapping the HTML content in a `<ul>` tag
> var wrapped_html = $("<ul>").html(html_data);
> 
> // Appending the wrapped HTML to an element with id `myElement`
> $("#myElement").append(wrapped_html);
> ```
> In this code, the `ul` element is created using `$('<ul>')`. The returned HTML content is then wrapped within this `ul` element using the `.html()` method. Finally, we use the jQuery `append()` method to add the wrapped HTML content to the specified element (in the example, an element with an id of `myElement`). 
> 
> It's worth noting that `.html()` method gets or sets the HTML content. When it gets the HTML, it returns the HTML content inside the first element in the set of matched elements. When it is used to set the HTML, it replaces the content of each element in the set of matched elements with the new content. The append() function is used to insert content towards the end of the selected elements.
