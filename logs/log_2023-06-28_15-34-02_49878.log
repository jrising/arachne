> What is the most common language in West Africa in general?
**assistant**:
> In West Africa, French is the most common language spoken across the region. This is largely due to the history of French colonization in several West African countries, such as Senegal, Ivory Coast, Guinea, and others. French is widely used in government, education, business, and media throughout the region.
> 
> English is also widely spoken in West Africa, particularly in countries that were under British colonization, such as Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Additionally, there are numerous indigenous languages spoken by different ethnic groups in West Africa, which reflect the rich linguistic diversity of the region.
