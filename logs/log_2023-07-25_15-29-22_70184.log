> I am working in the Mimi modeling framework in Julia. How do I get the keys of a dimension (like returned from dim_keys) within run_timestep, given that I don't have the model?

> If you're within the `run_timestep` function and you want to retrieve the keys of a dimension but you do not have access to the model, you'll need to pass the keys into the function as an argument.

> However, typically, if you need to access the keys within `run_timestep`, it may mean the design of your model could be improved. You might want to think about whether there's a way to organize your model such that all the information needed for a timestep is available without needing to access the model's dimensions' keys directly.
