> Hello, Austin! It's great to talk with you today. I love all the things you're interested in, especially that you like "your" moon and dragons! Very cool! 
> 
> Now, let's talk about how we make yogurt. It's made from milk, and we make it sour (in a good way) by adding something we call 'bacteria'. Don't worry — this kind of bacteria is safe and good for our health!
> 
> Here's how we do it:
> 
> 1. Heat the milk: First we need to heat up some milk. We do this so the good bacteria can do their job. The milk needs to be heated to about 180°F (82°C). That's very hot, so it's a job for a grown-up. 
> 
> 2. Cool the milk: After the milk has been heated, it's time to let it cool. We want it to cool down to just about 110-115°F (43-46°C). This is the temperature the good bacteria like best.
> 
> 3. Add the yogurt culture: Now it's time for the magic! We add some 'yogurt culture' to the warm milk. This is a fancy term for the good bacteria (sometimes called "probiotics") that will turn the milk into yogurt. Sometimes, we just add a couple tablespoons of already-made yogurt. 
> 
> 4. Let it work: Then we put our milk with the yogurt culture in a warm place and just let it sit there, undisturbed, for 7-8 hours. As it sits, the bacteria multiply and turn the milk into yummy yogurt.
> 
> 5. Enjoy: After the long wait, your yogurt is ready! You can see if it's firm and tangy, just like the yogurt you buy at the store. Put it in the fridge to get nice and cool, then you can eat it, maybe with a little honey or fruit on top! 
> 
> Remember, Austin, making yogurt has to be done with the help of an adult, because we need to heat the milk to a high temperature. So, you can ask your dad to help you make some. It may sound a bit like a science experiment, but it's really very simple and it can be lots of fun! Would you like to try? 
> 
> And just imagine, the good bacteria in the yogurt are a bit like the little helpers like the Doozers in Fraggle Rock, working hard to create something fantastic!
