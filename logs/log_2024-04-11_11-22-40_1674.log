> The EU ETS chose benchmarking over grandfathering to avoid "perverse incentives". What are those?
**assistant**:
> "Perverse incentives" refer to outcomes where an incentive produces an unintended and undesirable result, which is contrary to the intentions of its designers.

> In the context of the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), these perverse incentives could arise from a system known as "grandfathering." Grandfathering assigns emission allowances based on an entity's historical emissions. Entities that have historically emitted more greenhouse gases receive more allowances, effectively rewarding larger emitters. This could encourage firms to artificially increase their emissions ahead of allocation periods, to secure more allowances in the future.
> 
> Consequently, to avoid these perverse incentives, the EU ETS has largely moved towards an approach known as "benchmarking" for allowance allocation. Under this method, allowances are distributed based on performance standards (benchmarks) that reflect the best practices in a sector. This encourages firms to reduce their emissions, as more efficient firms are rewarded with more allowances relative to their emissions, whilst less efficient ones get fewer. 
> 
> In this way, benchmarking promotes technological innovation and efficiency, as firms are incentivized to employ cleaner technologies and practices in an effort to receive more allowances and hence gain a competitive advantage.
