**assistant**:
> This error message indicates that the Jekyll build process on GitHub Pages is encountering a problem when trying to render your CSS file `assets/css/style.scss`. The specific error `No such file or directory @ dir_chdir0 - /github/workspace/docs` suggests that it's looking for a file or directory that doesn't exist in the expected location.
> 
> Here are a few steps to troubleshoot this issue:
> 
> 1. **Check File Paths and Names:**
>    Ensure that all referenced files and directories exist and are correctly named. The paths in your `_config.yml`, as well as any includes or asset references in your HTML files, should match the actual structure of your repository.
> 
> 2. **Verify File Case-Sensitivity:**
>    Remember that filenames are case-sensitive on GitHub Pages. Double-check that the case you used in your path matches exactly.
> 
> 3. **Review `_config.yml`:**
>    Look at your `_config.yml` to see if there are any custom directories specified for your `source` or `destination`. These might alter where Jekyll looks for or places files.
> 
> 4. **Check for Broken Links or Missing Includes:**
>    If your Jekyll project includes files (using Liquid tags like `{% include %}`), make sure those files actually exist in the `_includes` folder or wherever they're supposed to be.
> 
> 5. **Look for `style.scss`:**
>    Make sure that `assets/css/style.scss` actually exists and that there aren’t any typos in its filename or path. Additionally, check the file for any errors in your Sass syntax that might cause an early failure before compiling.
> 
> 6. **Local Build:**
>    Try running the site locally with the same configuration to see if you get the same error. You can use the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` from your repository's root directory. This might help identify if the problem is local to GitHub Pages.
> 
> By systematically going through these steps, you should be able to pinpoint what's causing the issue. Let me know if you have any more questions or if you’d like further guidance on a particular step!
**user**:
> How do I just turn off this action?
**assistant**:
> If you want to disable the GitHub Actions workflow that is building your Jekyll site, you can do so by following these steps:
> 
> ### Disable GitHub Actions for Your Repository
> 
> 1. **Go to Your Repository:**
>    Navigate to the GitHub repository where your Jekyll project is hosted.
> 
> 2. **Go to the "Actions" Tab:**
>    Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of your repository page. This will show you the list of workflows and their status.
> 
> 3. **Find the Workflow File:**
>    Look for the workflow you want to disable. It’s often found in a file named `.github/workflows/<workflow_name>.yml`.
> 
> 4. **Edit the Workflow or Remove it:**
>    You have two options:
>    - **Disable the Workflow:**
>      - You can add `if: false` at the top level of the workflow file to disable it without deleting it.
>    - **Delete the Workflow:**
>      - Click on the workflow file, then click the pencil (edit) icon to edit the file, and simply delete its content or remove the file entirely.
> 
> 5. **Commit Your Changes:**
>    After making your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page, provide a commit message, and click "Commit changes."
> 
> ### Temporarily Disable GitHub Actions
> 
> If you want to keep the workflow file but prevent the action from running temporarily without modifying the code, you can:
> 
> 1. **Go to Repository Settings:**
>    Navigate to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
> 
> 2. **Scroll to "Actions":**
>    In the sidebar, select "Actions".
> 
> 3. **Change the Actions Permissions:**
>    Adjust the settings to allow/disallow workflows from running. You can choose to disable GitHub Actions entirely for the repository or adjust permissions for specific workflows.
> 
> ### Pause or Cancel Running Workflows
> 
> If you have workflows that are currently running and you want to stop them:
> 
> 1. **Go to the Actions Tab:**
>    In the "Actions" tab, find the currently running job.
> 
> 2. **Click on it:**
>    Open the running workflow.
> 
> 3. **Click "Cancel workflow":**
>    You should see an option to cancel the running job.
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to effectively disable GitHub Actions for your Jekyll project. Let me know if you need further assistance!
