> Is curriculum vitae singular or plural?
**assistant**:
> "Curriculum vitae" is singular. When referring to more than one, you would say "curricula vitae." This is because in Latin, "curriculum" is the subject (meaning "course") and "vitae" is a possessive genitive (meaning "of life"). So, the term literally translates to "course of life." Hence, when pluralized, "course" changes to "courses," while "of life" remains the same.
**user**:
> What is the plural?
**assistant**:
> The plural form of "curriculum vitae" is "curricula vitae." Each individual item is still referred to as a curriculum vitae, but when talking about multiple documents, you would use the term "curricula vitae." This plural form is not commonly used in everyday language, as "resumes" or "CVs" are more common terms in English.
