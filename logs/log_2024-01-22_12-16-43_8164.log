**user**:
> What counts as an invited talk on an academic resume? Do workshops count?
**assistant**:
> An "invited talk" on an academic resume typically refers to a presentation or speech requested by an organization, institution, or conference that the academic personally was asked to give. Generally, the invitation is extended to the individual because of their specific expertise or recognition in their field.
> 
> Workshops can count as invited talks if you, as the individual, were expressly invited to present or lead a session because of your specific expertise. If you just attended or participated in a workshop, it would not typically be considered an "invited talk", but could still be included on your CV under professional development or activities. 
> 
> Remember, the key attribute is being formally asked by the organizers to provide your expert insights due to your notable contributions in your field. Your role in such an event should be that of a speaker, presenter, or panellist, and not merely an attendee or participant.
> 
> Remember to include the title of your talk, the name of the hosting institution or event, the location (or note if it was a virtual event), and the date. The specific organization of these details can depend on the conventions of your specific field or the requirements of the position you are applying for.
