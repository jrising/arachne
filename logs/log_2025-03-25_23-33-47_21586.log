> As ocean-based industries expand and the economic value of marine resources is set to double by 2030, sustainable and effective marine spatial planning (MSP) becomes ever more critical. This paper examines data gaps that hinder the effective integration of ecological, economic, and social dimensions within MSP efforts, focusing on the Delaware coast. Utilizing a comprehensive catalog of spatially-resolved marine data, we assess multiple forms of data gaps pertinent to MSP processes. Our approach categorizes data into physical, resource, usage, management, economic, and future/proposed categories while emphasizing the interdependent nature of these data types. We evaluate 299 marine datasets spanning government records, NGOs, central data repositories, and academic articles, accounting for legacy and low-resolution issues. Our findings reveal significant data gaps across the Delaware coast, and supports the MSP process by identifying regions heavily used by only one or in potential conflict across two or more activities. This research provides a framework for identifying and addressing data deficiencies, facilitating more nuanced and effective MSP processes.Â

> When addressing the target audience for a talk based on your paper, consider who would benefit the most from understanding and applying the insights from your research. Here's a suggestion for your response:
> 
> The target audience for this talk includes policymakers, marine spatial planners, coastal managers, researchers, and stakeholders in ocean-based industries. These individuals and groups will gain the most from attending, as they are directly involved in the decision-making processes and on-the-ground implementation of marine spatial planning (MSP). Policymakers will benefit from insights into critical data gaps, helping to inform regulatory and funding priorities. Marine spatial planners and coastal managers can leverage the framework provided to identify and address deficiencies in current MSP efforts, leading to more sustainable and conflict-free usage of marine resources. Researchers will find value in the identification of data gaps, potentially guiding future research priorities. Stakeholders from ocean-based industries will gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of data interdependencies affecting their operations and potential areas of conflict or resource optimization. Overall, the talk aims to foster collaborative solutions among these varied interest groups to enhance the effectiveness of MSP along the Delaware coast and beyond.
