**user**:
> Do levelized costs include assumptions about discount rates?
**assistant**:
> Yes, Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) calculations typically do include assumptions about discount rates. 
> 
> The LCOE is the net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a system or a project. It is often given in currency per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-hour. It is a measure of a power source that allows comparison of different methods of electricity generation on a consistent basis.
> 
> The formula for LCOE is:
> 
> LCOE = ∑ (It + Mt + Ft) / (1+r)^t / ∑ Et / (1+r)^t
> 
> Where:
> - t is the year,
> - It, Mt, and Ft are the investment, maintenance and fuel costs in year t, respectively. 
> - Et is the electricity production in year t.
> - r is the discount rate.
> 
> As you can see, the discount rate (r) is included in the denominator of the equation to account for the time value of money. Changes in the discount rate can significantly affect the calculation of LCOE, making it a critical factor in project evaluation and energy policy. 
> 
> Thus, it is important to be clear about the assumed discount rate when comparing levelized costs across different studies or projects, since a lower discount rate will show a higher value of the future costs (and vice versa), impacting the LCOE value.
