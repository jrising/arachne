**user**:
> I am filing taxes jointly in the US with my wife. I've claimed the children on my taxes, so I think that means she doesn't. How many allowances should she put on her W-4 "Withholding Allowances Certificate"?
**assistant**:
> If you and your wife are filing taxes jointly, then you'll submit one tax return for the both of you, where you claim the total of your allowances and deductions for the entire family. So, the number of allowances your wife should put on her W-4 form shouldn't be determined separately from yours. 
> 
> However, if you're adjusting your W-4 forms for withholding reasons and you want to spread your allowances out, a larger number of allowances implies less tax will be withheld from the paycheck. That being said, for a family of four (yourself, your wife, and two children), it's common to put 3-4 allowances, given the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly and credits for two dependents. 
> 
> A general rule of thumb is to claim as follows:
> 
> - 2 allowances for yourself and your spouse (if filing jointly),
> - 1 allowance for each dependent.
> 
> In the current tax environment, you'd claim 4 allowances in total if you're following this structure. However, remember, these suggestions are just a general guide, the actual number can vary based on your personal financial situation, like if you're eligible for other tax credits (including education credits and childcare tax credits).
> 
> Please consult a tax adviser to get the most accurate advice for your personal financial situation.
**user**:
> My wife is getting a new job and is being asked by her new employer to fill out the W-4 certificate. Since I've already claimed the allowances, should she claim 0?
**assistant**:
> If your wife is starting a new job and her employer is asking her to fill out a W-4 certificate, it's a common practice to claim 0 allowances in this situation. By doing so, it will maximize the amount of taxes withheld from her paycheck, which can help ensure that you don't owe a large tax bill when it comes time to file your joint tax return.
> 
> Claiming 0 allowances effectively assumes that she has no other deductions or allowances to claim. It results in a higher withholding rate, which means more taxes will be withheld from her paycheck. This can help offset the fact that you have already claimed the allowances for your dependents on your own W-4 form.
> 
> However, it's important to note that claiming 0 allowances may result in somewhat higher taxes being withheld from her paycheck than necessary. This can lead to a larger tax refund when you file your joint tax return, as the excess withholding will be accounted for. If you prefer to have more money available in your paycheck throughout the year, she could consider claiming 1 or 2 allowances instead.
> 
> Ultimately, the decision depends on your specific tax situation and financial preferences. It's always a good idea to consult a tax professional or use online tax calculators to determine the most appropriate withholding allowances for your circumstances.
