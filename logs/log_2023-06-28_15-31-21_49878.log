**assistant**:
> The short furry creatures in Star Wars are called Ewoks. They are a species of small, bear-like bipeds who inhabit the forest moon of Endor. Ewoks made their first appearance in the 1983 film "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," where they played a significant role in helping the Rebel Alliance in the Battle of Endor against the Galactic Empire. Ewoks are known for their primitive technology, tree-dwelling villages, and their alliance with the Rebel forces.
