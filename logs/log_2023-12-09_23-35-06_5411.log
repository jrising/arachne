**user**:
> What would be a dangerous wave height for a 19th century 3-mast ship such as the whaler Essex?
**assistant**:
> Given the size and shape of a 19th-century 3 mast ship like the Essex, we can say that it was a fairly stable vessel in open water. However, it would still be vulnerable to extreme sea conditions. While exact numbers may vary and there's little specific historical data, contemporary vessels in similar size ranges generally start to experience difficulty in wave heights over 5–6 meters (16-20 feet). 
> 
> Once wave heights exceed 8–10 meters (26-33 feet), conditions can be considered dangerous, leading to possibility of the ship capsizing due to rolling or pitchpoling (flipping end over end). However, experienced crews and captains used clever seamanship to maneuver through such conditions, for example by sailing with the waves (running before the wind), rather than against (beating into the wind). They might also deploy drogues to manage their speed and control the direction of their vessel.
> 
> Extreme waves, or 'rogue waves,' which are 2-3 times the significant wave height (average of the highest one-third of waves) can pose a particular risk, and may occur even in less severe sea conditions. These unexpected monsters can exceed 20-30 meters (65-100 feet) and can pose significant risk to any vessel.
> 
> Keep in mind, though, risk from conditions at sea is not purely about wave height. Other factors such as wave period, wind speed and direction, visibility, temperature, currents, the condition of the ship, and the experience and preparedness of the crew play critical roles in the actual danger experienced.
