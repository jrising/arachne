**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Sand and Borrow Sites” as a data gap. Here is the discussion in Dewberry Engineers 2018:

> The forthcoming BOEM Marine Minerals Information System will provided needed information on potential sand and borrow sites synthesized for both state and federal waters. Current data sets are not complete and are not synthesized, so users have had to acquire state data sets for nearshore areas, where available, and BOEM data for areas farther offshore. It was noted that the current BOEM site can be difficult to navigate, there are many portals, data are scattered, and the sand areas are not named with “sand.” Historic data are also not all in digital format.

> The Great Lakes experience bluff failures from erosion. Littoral drift needs to be better understood and nearshore monitoring is needed. A recent restoration project failed due to a lack of understanding of littoral drift. Decision making depends on good data.

**assistant**:
> Certainly, here's a synthesized summary of the material from both Dewberry Engineers 2018 and Trice et al. 2021:
> 
> Sand, gravel, and cobble borrow sites, which are areas designated where ocean bottom materials can be "borrowed" for use in beach nourishment or other purposes, represent a significant data gap in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. Information related to these sites is crucial for a variety of areas, such as offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience and climate adaptation, sand and sediment management, species and habitat management, oil and gas exploration and extraction, maritime and navigation safety, and permitting and siting for offshore infrastructure (Dewberry Engineers, 2018).
> 
> Improvements in this data could provide more accurate decision-making tools, helping to manage shoreline erosion, littoral drift, future coastal development, and better planning in relation to species habitat and fishing areas. Notably, understanding and monitoring of littoral drift is critical, as some restoration projects have reportedly failed due to a lack of understanding in this area (Dewberry Engineers, 2018).
> 
> However, both Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021) point out that existing information on sand and borrow sites is incomplete and not synthesized for practical use, making it difficult to navigate and make informed decisions. Additionally, historical data is not consistently available in digital formats, presenting obstacles to its use in the planning process. 
> 
> The forthcoming Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Marine Minerals Information System is expected to address many of these data issues, synthesizing information on potential sand and borrow sites for both state and federal waters. This promises to provide much-needed data improvements that will bolster decision-making related to Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process (Dewberry Engineers 2018, Trice et al., 2021).
> 
> To conclude, the data related to the sand and borrow sites is a key gap that needs addressing to effectively manage and plan sustainable activities in the Delaware Ocean and Bay. The BOEM Marine Minerals Information System, once available, is expected to overcome many of these data challenges.
