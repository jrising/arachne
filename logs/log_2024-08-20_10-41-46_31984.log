> I have a google treemap displayed in a Shiny app. It worked fine until I switched to the ShinyDashboard package, and then it is given a very small space. It's within a full-width box:
>                     box(title="Coastal Businesses", width=12,
>                         HTML('<div id="chart_div" style="width: 1000px; height: 400px;"></div>')),
>                     ),
> But the actual treemap is only given 400 px x 200 px. Any ideas why
**assistant**:
> When using ShinyDashboard, some of the layout settings can differ from standard Shiny applications, particularly related to how space is allocated and CSS is applied. Here are a few things to consider to address your issue:
> 
> 1. **Ensure the container is not restricting size**: Check the enclosing container's CSS to ensure it's not limiting the size of the treemap. You might want to inspect the element in your browser's developer tools to see if any parent containers are constraining its size.
> 
> 2. **Use CSS directly**: Apply CSS directly to ensure that your treemap uses the full space available. You can either do this in a separate CSS file that you include in your app or directly within the app's UI definition. Here's an example of inline CSS adjustments:
> 
>    ```r
>    tags$style(HTML("
>       #chart_div {
>           width: 100% !important;
>           height: 400px !important;
>       }
>    "))
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Check conflicting styles**: Sometimes other styles (from ShinyDashboard or other components) might override your settings. Using `!important` in CSS is a way to enforce your desired settings and ensure they take precedence.
> 
> 4. **Verify width in the box panel**: ShinyDashboard's `box` might have default padding or margin settings. You may consider setting a specific height and utilizing `height = "auto"` for the width to adapt to the available space.
> 
> 5. **JavaScript for dynamic resizing**: If your UI changes dynamically and may require resizing, consider adding JavaScript that updates the size of your treemap based on the available space whenever the window resizes:
> 
>    ```r
>    tags$script(HTML("
>       $(document).on('shiny:connected', function(e) {
>          var resetSize = function() {
>             var width = $('#chart_div').width();
>             var height = 400; // Or calculate dynamically for auto-height
>             $('#chart_div > div').width(width).height(height);
>          };
>          $(window).on('resize', resetSize);
>          resetSize();
>       });
>    "))
>    ```
>
