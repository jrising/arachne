> Would you be interested in speaking on a panel as part of a live event for the Virtual Ocean Pavilion at COP28? We do not have an exact date or time for the event, but we expect it to be held sometime Nov 30-Dec 12th.

> Kimberly and I have been discussing some ideas, and here's the current thought (we have 300 characters, including spaces, for the abstract):
> The United Nations Ocean Decade catchphrase is "the science we need for the ocean we want," but deciding who WE are and what we WANT is a difficult social science problem. Our event will highlight different ways of thinking about how social goals are negotiated and how they change. 
> 
> Proposed speakers:
> Kimberly Oremus on adaptive governance to allow goals to shift over time, using illustrations from fisheries regulation 
> James Rising on the challenges of cost benefit analyses and implicit goal-setting 
> Jeremy Firestone on preferences for offshore wind siting and how values shape goals 
> A.R. Siders on risk tolerances and community versus individual goals over different timelines 
> I am very open to re-framing on any of this - the overall position or individual contributions. The hope is to build connections with the Global Ocean Forum, who is organizing the Pavilion, and with international oceans networks also engaging with the pavilion. We are asked to submit a proposal for a talk by this Friday, Sep 22nd, and will be told by the end of the month if we are successful. We would then have October & November to finalize details and sort out the logistics.

> What is "implicit goal-setting"?
**assistant**:
> Implicit goal-setting refers to the creation of objectives or targets that are indirectly established rather than explicitly stated. They often emerge from actions, decisions, or methods used, even if the goals themselves are not formally articulated. 
> 
> In the context of this panel, the term seems to be used to represent how assumptions and methodologies connected to economic cost-benefit analyses can subtly embed certain goals and values. For example, when performing a cost-benefit analysis of a particular sustainability initiative, implicit goals might include optimization of economic efficiency or maximization of net benefits. But these goals might not align with broader or different societal goals such as fairness, intergenerational equity, or conservation of biodiversity. Identifying and addressing these implicit goals could be important to ensure a more holistic and inclusive approach to sustainability.
