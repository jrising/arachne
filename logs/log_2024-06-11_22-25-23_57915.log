> I want to fit a loess to some data, but the data is long-tail distributed in the y-axis. But I don't want to just take the log of it, because then I'll lose the zeros. What options do I have?
**assistant**:
> Fitting a loess (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) model to data with a long-tailed distribution in the y-axis, while preserving zeros, can be challenging. Here are some approaches you can consider:
> 
> 1. **Box-Cox Transformation**: The Box-Cox transformation can handle a wide range of data distributions and can accommodate zeros and negative values (with appropriate adjustments). You can use a variant called the "shifted" Box-Cox transformation if necessary.
> 
> 2. **Yeo-Johnson Transformation**: This transformation is similar to the Box-Cox transformation but can be applied to data that includes zeros and negative values. 
> 
> 3. **Square Root Transformation**: If the tails are not extremely heavy, a square root transformation might sufficiently normalize the distribution, while preserving zeros.
> 
> 4. **Asymptotic Adjustments**: Instead of transforming the data, you could adjust the modeling approach to give less influence to large values. This might be done by weighting observations differently in the loess smoothing process.
> 
> 5. **Quantile Regression**: If the primary concern is understanding trends rather than pointwise fitting, quantile regression smoothing can provide estimates for specific quantiles (such as the median), which can be more robust to long tails.
> 
> 6. **Winsorization**: This involves limiting extreme values in the data to reduce the influence of outliers. It is done by setting outliers to a predefined percentile level, which can help in dealing with long-tailed distributions while keeping zeros unchanged.
> 
> Here's an example of how to implement the Yeo-Johnson transformation in R using the `car` package:
> 
> ```r
> library(car)
> transformed_data <- yjPower(your_data$y)
> 
> loess_fit <- loess(transformed_data ~ your_data$x, span = 0.5)
> 
> # To back-transform the predictions:
> inverse_transformed_predictions <- invBoxCox(loess_fit$fitted, parameter = estimated_lambda)
> ```
> 
> Remember to choose the method that aligns best with the specific characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis. If you need more granular help with implementation, feel free to ask!
