**assistant**:
> It looks like you're using `shinyjs` to hide your action buttons, but they are still displayed. This is often due to either forgetting to include or incorrectly initializing `shinyjs` in your Shiny app. Here's how you can properly integrate `shinyjs` and hide buttons:
> 
> 1. **Include `shinyjs` in your `ui` and `server` functions.**
> 2. **Ensure `shinyjs` is initialized in your `ui` function.**
> 
> Here's a complete example demonstrating the correct usage:
> 
> ```r
> library(shiny)
> library(shinyjs)
> 
> ui <- fluidPage(
>   useShinyjs(),  # Initialize shinyjs in the UI
>   mainPanel(
>     plotlyOutput("sccdist", height = "500px"),
>     uiOutput("configTable"),
>     hidden(actionButton("saveButton", "Save Configuration")),
>     hidden(actionButton("loadButton", "Load Selected Configuration"))
>   )
> )
> 
> server <- function(input, output, session) {
>   # Server logic here
> }
> 
> shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
> ```
> 
> ### Key Points:
> 1. **`useShinyjs()`**: You must include `useShinyjs()` somewhere in your `ui` to properly initialize `shinyjs`.
> 2. **Correct Usage of `hidden()`**: Wrap your buttons with `hidden()` as you did, but ensure the above initialization steps are followed.
> 
> By adding `useShinyjs()` to your `fluidPage`, you activate the shinyjs functionality, allowing the `hidden()` function to work as expected. If you follow these steps, the buttons should initially be hidden when the app starts.
