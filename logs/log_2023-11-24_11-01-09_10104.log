**user**:
> I want to highlight that some work I'm doing is doing a first synthesis of a literature with a lot of disagreements-- without undermining the sense of quality in that work. My current sentence for the key question is "What is a “best estimate” from rapidly evolving the literature on macroeconomic statistical models of climate impacts?", where "rapidly evolving" is accurate but doesn't give a sense of the disagreements. Do you have suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James! I understand your need to convey both the volume of disagreement and the rapid evolution occurring in the literature, without undermining the entirety of the work. Here's a suggestion for a revised question: 
> 
> "What can we distill as a robust conclusion from the dynamic and often divergent literature on macroeconomic statistical models of climate impacts?"
> 
> By using the phrase "dynamic and often divergent," we acknowledge that the literature is changing quickly and contains a range of views. The inclusion of the term "robust conclusion" denotes both the challenges of resolving disagreement in the literature and the quality of the whole research process necessary to arrive at a sound, defensible synthesis.
