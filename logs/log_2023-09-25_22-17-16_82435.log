**user**:
> I have a graphic that shows the material stocks and flows of something. There's a large stock in the middle of soil (50 cm topsoil) of 40-50 Gt. 15 Mt /yr flows to the soil from a mineral stock (13 Gt total) and the atmosphere provides a flow of 0.4 - 2 Mt/yr. I think it might be nitrogen or phosphorus. What is this? 
**assistant**:
> Based on the details provided, it seems very likely that the graphic you're referencing is a depiction of the phosphorus cycle. 
> 
> Nitrogen is primarily sourced from the atmosphere through nitrogen fixation, and the total stock of nitrogen in the atmosphere is substantially larger than the figures you provided. On the other hand, phosphorus is mainly sourced from minerals in the earth's crust and enters the soil through weathering. 
> 
> The numbers you provided align more closely with estimates of the global phosphorus cycle. Phosphorus is a critical nutrient for all life forms and is a key component in agriculture and soil fertility. As such, understanding and managing the phosphorus cycle is crucial to promoting global sustainability.
> 
> Please note that these values are rough estimates and the actual numbers can vary based on different sources and methods of calculations.
