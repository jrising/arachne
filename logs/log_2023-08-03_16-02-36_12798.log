> I am reviewing a paper which claims that majors in Xiamen University are randomly assigned. They say, "due to the university application mechanism, only some

> Based on my knowledge of undergraduate enrollment processes in China, it appears that Xiamen University's system is likely similar to others in the country. It is crucial to note that the term "randomly assigned" might not precisely translate to the Western context of random assignment.

> Here's how the system generally works:
> 
> 1. High school students in China prepare for and take an intense, significant college entrance test called the Gaokao. This test score forms the core basis of their college admission.
> 
> 2. When applying to universities, students not only choose the institutions but also list the majors they're interested in, in order of preference. This preference listing is usually based on their Gaokao score. High scorers may have more freedom to choose preferred, competitive majors compared to those with lower scores.
> 
> 3. Universities, such as Xiamen University, then reassess the preference list provided by the incoming students, alongside the availability and limits of each major. This reassessment is where "random" allocation might come into the picture.
> 
> 4. If a student's top choice of major is already filled (i.e., has reached its quota), the university will assign the student to his/her second preference, and so on. If all the preferred majors are filled or the student's Gaokao score is not sufficient for their desired field, the university may place them in other under-subscribed programs, which could be seen as "random" from the studentsâ€™ viewpoint.

> Put differently, students might end up with a major which wasn't their first, second, or third choice in some cases due to the university's need to maintain curriculum balance. While from the students' perception this may seem like a random allocation, it's essential to appreciate that it's a system-driven allocation based on multiple factors, including applicant preference, test scores, and major availability.

> Please note that this general explanation is based on available data on China's university admission processes. The exact mechanisms might vary from university to university, so I recommend further direct research on Xiamen University's specific system or a direct clarification request from the paper's authors.
