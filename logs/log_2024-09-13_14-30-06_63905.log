>   Dear Professor Rising,
> 
> My name is Shayan Pourjafar; I obtained my Master's degree in Environmental Systems Engineering from the University of Tehran, as the first rank with a perfect GPA of 4.0/4.0, and a thesis focusing on comparative analysis of sustainable development approaches. I have already contributed to a submitted paper on waste management, and I am currently engaged in writing manuscripts for my two in-preparation papers on urban sustainability and sustainability paradigms, and translating the Companion to Environmental Studies book into Persian. I am writing to inquire if you are accepting Ph.D. students in the fall of 2025.
> 
> I am well versed in conducting research and aiding in data collection and analysis as I already have experience working with various analytical tools such as Python, ArcGIS, and Power BI, to name a few. I also gained invaluable communication skills and teaching insight as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Tehran. For further details of my background and skill set, please find my CV and the link to my website which is available at the top of it attached to this email.
> 
> In search for better education, research opportunities, and access to hands-on experience in the field of climate politics, I came across your profile, specifically, your 2023 publication in Science journal. The perspective of our potential collaboration and having you as a supervisor fascinates me. I also will be available for a brief online interview to present my qualifications in details and discuss alignment of our interests.
> 
> Thank you for your time and consideration.

> Sincerely,
> Shayan Pourjafar

**assistant**:
> **Specific Questions or Core Confusions:**
> 
> 1. Shayan is inquiring if James is accepting Ph.D. students for the fall of 2025, specifically interested in climate politics and potential collaboration.
> 2. Shayan expresses strong interest in James' research and is interested in a possible interview to discuss qualifications and alignment of interests.
> 
> **Program of Interest:**
> 
> Given that Shayan mentions an interest in a Ph.D. program and highlights climate politics and research skills in data analysis, the **Ph.D. in Environmental Economics** seems to be the most suitable match. If there's a mix of interests that aren't fully clear, his focus on quantitative tools and climate politics also makes the **Ph.D. in Marine Policy** a possibility, though the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics is the preferred choice for alignment with James’ research.

> Dear Shayan,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in my work. It sounds like you would be a good candidate for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program, given your research background and interests. However, please be aware that funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds.
