> How do I include a Policy Forum article in Science that I published on my resume? It was peer reviewed, but is not a normal Science research article.
**assistant**:
> Sure, if you're updating your resume, it's important to highlight published papers, especially such prestigious contributions like a Policy Forum article in Science. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ### Publications
> 
> **Your Article's Title**  
> _Rising, James (co-authors if any), "Your Article's Title", Science, Policy Forum, vol. #, no. #, pp. #-#, year._
> 
> The inclusion of "Policy Forum" after the journal name clearly indicates the section of the journal where your article appeared. This gives clarity on the nature of publications, particularly important when contributions are outside traditional research manuscript formats like in your case.
> 
> Make sure to include your co-authors (if any) and the full citation including volume, issue, page numbers, and year of publication, if available. Another important aspect is to keep the research articles and articles of different nature (like a policy forum) in separate sub-sections for clear classification.
