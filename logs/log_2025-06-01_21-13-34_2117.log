**assistant**:
> When someone has not attended a group for many years, it is often referred to as being "absent" or "inactive." Depending on the context, you might also say that the person has "lapsed" or is a "former" member of the group. If they choose to re-engage after such a period, they might be considered as making a "return" or "comeback." If you have a specific context in mind, I can provide a more tailored response!
