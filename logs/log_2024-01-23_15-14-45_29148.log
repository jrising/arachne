**user**:
> Where can I find relationships between nutritional deficiencies or food insecurity and morbidity (anthropometry and illnesses)? I want something like, in food insecure places, wasting is 30% higher. Or, when there's severe iron deficiency, the risk of anemia is high (both of those quantified somehow).
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can help identify reliable sources of information on this. Here are some you may find useful:
> 
> 1. **Global Nutrition Report**: The annual Global Nutrition Reports provide comprehensive data and insights into malnutrition at a global scale, including its various forms like undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity. They also discuss ways to address these issues.
> 
> 2. **FAO â€“ The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report**: This annual report provides an in-depth analysis of the major factors influencing food security and nutrition and the link between food insecurity and health, including micronutrient deficiencies.
> 
> 3. **Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition**: This academic publication series has often addressed the link between nutrition deficiencies and morbidity and mortality rates in various populations. 
> 
> 4. **Studies and Datasets on IHME (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation) Website**: IHME has various global health databases that include data on morbidity, nutritional deficiencies, and food security. 
> 
> 5. **World Health Organization (WHO) Database and Publications**: WHO's global health observatory data repository, along with their publications, often have pertinent information on the relationship between nutrition deficiencies, food insecurity, and health outcomes.
> 
> 6. **Peer-reviewed studies**: Numerous studies have been published in scientific journals that explore the complex links between nutrient deficiencies, food insecurity, and morbidity. These can often be found in databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, etc. 
> 
> Remember, while many sources provide a rough association between nutrition deficiencies or food insecurity and morbidity, the specific quantification like "in food insecure places, wasting is 30% higher" may vary widely depending on the regional context and the source of data. Hence, it becomes important to interpret these sources in the correct context. 
>    
> It would be also beneficial to take into consideration factors such as socio-economic influences, local diets, and agrarian practices as these variables can have an effect on both food security metrics and nutritional outcomes.
