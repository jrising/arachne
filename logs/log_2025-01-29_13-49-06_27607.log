He has shown some conditional willingness but since the date for funding has lapsed, the funding will be a potential issue. Is it possible that my current funding which I am getting as a PhD student from the Biden School is transferred to the Environmental Economics Program (for one year or sometime, they can figure out funding)? Alternatively, what else can be the way out, can graduate college provide some funding?

That suggests to me that you need to get agreement from the Biden School that your funding can be transferred over. Once you get that, we can collect the rest of the information we need.

I shall be extremely grateful for your assistance as I really intend to transfer and in case, I am unable to transfer this year, too much time will be lost for me to shift to a different program as I am already in the second year of a PhD program. Therefore, I shall be extremely grateful for your assistance.

The point I am trying to make is that sometimes, some or any of the students do not accept admission, which can create room for those on the waiting list. Can there be any such case for me or otherwise any sort of funding in the form of TA, RA, or GA may be able to help me? Kindly guide me as I intend to transfer without losing much time. In the meantime, I am checking from the Biden School whether they would allow for the funding to be transferred with the contract.

> I got it. So, I checked from the Biden School, and the information I got is that, in some cases, they may fund students for 1 semester if transferring to a different program to smooth the transition. I am unsure, but in some rare circumstances, they may agree to fund students for two semesters (one academic year), but beyond that, it will be nearly impossible. However, I may have to check that with higher authorities. Even in that case, I have consumed two years of funding here with a maximum remaining three years, while in case I transfer to EE, I need to have a minimum of 4-5 years of continued funding.
> 
> Therefore, if the EE program intends to transfer me, for the first year, the Biden School may transfer my funding for up to 1 year but after that, I would request the EE program to fund me. In that case, in my second year at the EE program, they may fund me first, before giving funding to anyone else.
