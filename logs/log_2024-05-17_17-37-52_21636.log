**assistant**:
> In Julia, a vector that contains both `Dict{Symbol, Any}` and `nothing` values is of the type `Vector{Union{Nothing, Dict{Symbol, Any}}}`. Here, `Union` allows the vector to contain either `Nothing` or `Dict{Symbol, Any}`. This is a versatile approach that provides flexibility in handling different data types within Julia.
