> How much will it cost globally to reduce methane by 30% in 2030?

> I'm sorry, but it's difficult to give a precise figure on the cost of reducing global methane emissions by 30% by 2030 as it would involve extensive modelling and consideration of a wide range of factors. These factors include the technical feasibility of different methane reduction strategies, the cost-effectiveness of these strategies, and the political and economic conditions in different countries.

> For example, in the agriculture sector, reducing methane might involve investing in new technologies or practices to reduce enteric fermentation (a major source of methane from livestock) or to capture and use methane from manure. In the fossil fuel sector, it could involve investing in new infrastructure to capture and utilize methane that would otherwise be vented or flared, or replacing gas-powered equipment with electric or zero-emission alternatives.

> While it's challenging to provide a precise figure, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its 2021 report stated that three-quarters of the global methane emissions could be reduced with the technology available today, and approximately half of these reductions could be achieved at no net cost because the value of the captured methane could offset the costs of capturing it.

> Please note that these are just estimates and the actual costs can vary significantly based on the above-mentioned factors. The global cost will also depend on the actions of individual countries and the international cooperation level. In order to have a more precise estimate, we would need updated, detailed, and region-specific data. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, such a precise estimate does not exist.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and reducing methane emissions can play a key role in mitigating climate change and its potentially catastrophic impacts.
