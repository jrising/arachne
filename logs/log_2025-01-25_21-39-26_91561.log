> 1. Overall assessment
> Project has achieved most of its objectives and milestones for the period with relatively minor deviations.
> 2. Significant results linked to dissemination, exploitation and impact potential
> Project will likely provide results with significant immediate or potential impact in the next reporting period (even if not
> all objectives mentioned in the Annex 1 to the GA were achieved).
> As anticipated in the DoA, the main findings from this first reporting period are essentially instrumental since they will
> be applied in the project's later stages to produce the results that are most applicable, exploitable, and meaningful.
> One of the main innovative aspects of TransformAr is the development of adaptation pathways that also provide insights
> related to the water-energy-food systems. This enables stakeholders to co-create and co-design the solutions. The key
> exploitable results from the project are:
> - The playbook;
> - The ensemble of climatic, hydrological and environmental data;
> - Data and tools for transformational adaptation.
> Moreover, TransformAr has demonstrated numerous successes in its overall effectiveness for achieving its results linked
> to dissemination, and impact potential. These include:
> • Improving knowledge and raising awareness about transformational adaptation pathways in the 6 lighthouse
> demonstrators (LDs), and beyond;
> • Strengthening a common baseline and understanding on stakeholder engagement processes to co-design climate
> adaptation solutions;
> • Co-developing frameworks to support 22 actionable adaptive solutions implementation in the 6 LDs;
> • Supporting the adaptation community to improve capacities in the LDs and beyond.
> Importantly, the consortium already identified transformational adaptation visions, solutions and/or pathways in the LDs,
> by organizing a total of 16 workshops with stakeholders from different domains. This is an extraordinary achievement for
> the first reporting period. Laudable efforts have been undertaken by the demonstrator leaders and all partners involved
> in the fieldwork to achieve very good outcomes in such a short time-frame.
> The future success of the project in terms of expected impacts and innovation highly depends on: i) how the
> transformational adaptation visions, solutions and/or pathways will be implemented in the LDs and how heterogeneous
> groups of stakeholders will be engaged; ii) how the key outcomes will be used and by whom; iii) how the LDs actionable
> adaptive solutions will be made available to other relevant and interested stakeholders for future up-scaling; iv) how the
> consortium will manage to enhance their publication activities and to identify the key exploitable results.
> Overall, very good progress has been made concerning dissemination. The project has already published relevant
> public deliverables. Many of the dissemination channels and tools are already active including: webpage, social media,
> stakeholder engagement via interviews and workshops, press releases, participation to events and conferences, joint
> newsletters with sister projects, one publication in conference proceedings, etc. (see progress report).
> 3. General comments
> Main scientific and/or technological achievements of the project:
> Overall, the project has progressed well and has achieved most of the objectives specified in the DoA for this reporting
> period. It aims to develop and demonstrate products and services, in order to accelerate large-scale transformative
> adaptation processes in vulnerable communities and regions throughout Europe. An environment is generated in the
> Lightouse Demonstrators (LDs) to foster knowledge sharing, cross-sectoral and cross-regional opportunities, and legacy.
> This represents a robust entry point into the EU Mission Adaptation Community of Practice.
> Main innovation outputs:
> The most relevant innovations arise from the work developed so far in WP3. The WP3 outcomes (especially D3.2.1 and
> D 3.3) represent a precious heritage of TRansformAr and they are of relevance for a larger audience that goes beyond
> the project. Such structured and open access collections are of great help for similar projects as well as for practitioners
> in climate adaptation. WP1 provides a detailed and comprehensive set of guidelines, e.g. for stakeholder engagement
> which will be very useful in future implementations of adaptation solutions. Ongoing work in WP2, WP4, WP5 and
> WP6 is also expected to contribute to advancing the state of the art. However, this will be achieved in the next reporting
> periods. The implementation of 22 actionable adaptation solutions holds potential for innovation.
> Contribution to the state of the art:
> Generally, the project is contributing in all its main areas to the current state of the art. However, the advancements/
> Page 2 of 15
> innovation of the state of the art are not always evident. Presently several deliverables (e.g. D1.2, D3.2) are primarily
> descriptive and do not clearly highlight if/how their findings/reviews are new and what is the added value to existing
> literature or practices. In the next reporting periods, the consortium is invited to reflect more systematically on how their
> work is innovative. Several WPs are promising in this respect, e.g. findings of the discrete choice experiment (WP6),
> socio-economic impact assessment in WP2.
> Scientific and/or technological quality of the results:
> Overall, the deliverables reviewed are of good quality and the consortium already made considerable achievements
> concerning the identification of transformational adaptation pathways. some of the most outstanding results so far are:
> identification of adaptation visions, solutions and/or pathways in all 6 LDs (D3.3), the playbook methodology (D3.2.1),
> the governance framework tool (D3.1.).
> 4. Recommendations concerning the period covered by the report
> Acceptance or rejection of resources:
> Resources employed are commensurate to the workload and clearly documented, therefore can be accepted. Some minor
> changes (primarily delays) have been clearly justified and do not have a major impact on the use of resources. The
> resources are carefully used, where they are in line with the DoA and they represent good value for money.
> Work done and possible required corrective actions:
> During the first 18 months, the project has achieved all its objectives and almost all milestones for the period with only
> some delays from the scheduling reported in the DoA. Nevertheless, all the delays and deviations have been shared and
> agreed upon with the Project Officer and the reasons are completely justifiable.
> All deliverables have been accepted, except D6.6 (Preliminary Exploitation Plan). In general, the milestones are
> accomplished. Some minor deviations could be addressed in the forthcoming reporting period. Further details are
> provided in Annex 1.
> Dissemination and communication activities:
> Communication and dissemination have been properly planned and implemented in the first 18 months of the project
> through a series of coordinated activities, which encompasses the creation of a series of channels to communicate the
> project outcomes (website, social media, etc.). The visibility of the scientific publications if any, needs to be ensured
> e.g. in the Knowledge Centre of the project web-site.
> Exploitation plans:
> As reported in the periodic technical report, the identification of the key exploitable results is ongoing. The preliminary
> plan for exploitation needs to be improved. This will ensure the achievement of the project objectives and increase
> efficiency in the following reporting period. It will also ensure the successful implementation of the project. The
> methodology for exploitation is not clearly stated. Quantitative metrics regarding performance exploitation should be
> provided. Furthermore, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) need to be scrutinized to protect background and foreground
> IPs.
> 5. Recommendations concerning future work, if applicable
> The success of the project depends to a large extent on how it manages, in close cooperation with the LDs partners,
> to deliver transformational adaptation strategies that are relevant, useful and usable at the local level. General
> recommendations:
> Improve data sets availability:
> For LDs, available data sets, sources, models, content, and data quality information are not clearly stated. The previous
> studies in these areas could provide additional baseline information on these hazards and risks and could enrich the
> planned repository.
> Become more concrete and practical:
> The first reporting period was necessarily focused on building the foundations for knowledge generation, design of
> stakeholder engagement processes etc. For the next reporting periods, adaptation pathways should become as concrete
> as practical as possible in order to implement the 22 actionable adaptive solutions before the project ends.
> Include diverse stakeholder`s views/perspectives in all LDs processes:
> It is essential to guarantee the representation of heterogeneous stakeholders groups in all the transformational adaptation
> co-design processes. In some LDs, only stakeholders from one or two organisations (e.g. municipalities and universities)
> attended the workshops (see D3.3. Annex). This is problematic because some perspectives may not be represented, thus
> hindering inclusiveness. Moreover, this can generate conflicts linked to equity, justice and exclusion in the later stages of
> the adaptation pathways co-design processes. Quota systems for workshop attendees and/or supplementary interviews
> Page 3 of 15
> to guarantee that different views are included in the future activities are essential. Among others, this can avoid incurring
> in conflicts (e.g. on selected adaptation solutions) later on in the processes. Closer cooperation between WP1 and WP3
> partners is recommended. Close collaboration with local/regional policymakers is highly recommended to exploit the
> achieved results successfully.
> Focus on monitoring impacts in the demonstrators and on policy impacts:
> It is suggested to monitor as systematically as possible some expected impacts also in the pilots, in order to
> document uptake by decision-makers, keep project partners focused on impact, and promote the project’s demonstrable
> accomplishments. D8.4 KPI report is expected to monitor impacts. It is recommended to focus also on impacts in the LDs.
> Identify and promote key innovations:
> As an innovation action, TransformAr has a strong focus on promoting innovation in the LDs and beyond. The consortium
> should systematically reflect upon and clearly identify the key innovations that they promote, e.g. not only in terms
> of outcomes but also of adoption of a particular approach instead of another, e.g. Do the stakeholder engagement
> approaches and pathways promote innovation (at the theoretical, methodological and practical level) in the co-design
> of transformational adaptation solutions? Overall, the partners can be more ambitious in defining and articulating more
> clearly the innovative aspects of the project.
> Provide metrics for exploitation performance:
> The exploitation approach is not explicit. It is necessary to provide metrics for exploitation performance.
> Specific recommendations on coordination and synergies:
> - These first period reporting of the 4 sister projects presents numerous strengths and opportunities that can be explored
> through collaborative efforts. Conducting a SWOT analysis would enable a comprehensive exploration of all following
> aspects: risks (such as technological and business risks) and bottlenecks (including regulations and local business
> dynamics) that need to be identified early on to mitigate any potential adverse effects. Additionally, organizing a
> workshop to discuss these matters and consider possible adaptation pathways would be beneficial. The participation of
> policymakers representing the Case Study regions holds significant relevance in this endeavor.
> - It is important to actively facilitate the interconnection of different communities of practice that emerge as a result of
> the co-creation activities carried out within the projects. One way to accomplish this is by identifying individuals who
> play a pivotal role in connecting and fostering collaboration within these communities. By proactively encouraging the
> participation of key connectors or facilitators in these cross-pollination and clustering activities, the projects can leverage
> their expertise and network to promote effective knowledge transfer and collaborative problem-solving.
> - It would be beneficial to create a mapping of the current status across the sister projects. This implies a) detailed
> mapping of what each project is doing in that region, including number and nature of each participatory event,
> stakeholders, and citizens involved, b) an umbrella framework that integrates the tools provided by each project (e.g.
> in the case of IMPETUS and ARSINOE, integrate the data catalogue, the knowledge graph and the hot-spots tool for
> instance). It is recommended that TransformAr continues to contribute to these activities.
> More precisely, this mapping would allow for a comprehensive comparison and evaluation. In this regard, the "Overview
> of the Climate Adaptation Mission project tools - June 2023" (available at https://regilience.eu/tools-and-solutions/)
> provides a valuable resource that addresses the initial efforts effectively. It is crucial to manage and sustain these ongoing
> efforts to ensure their continuity and effectiveness.
> - There is an overlap of case study areas among the mission projects, which has the potential to generate valuable
> synergies and possible competition. Furthermore, the wide range of available solutions may create ambiguities for
> policymakers. Therefore, it is crucial for the final deliverables to be consistent, inclusive, and coherent to address these
> challenges effectively. Therefore, we recommend establishing a task force to align the outcomes of the projects, and
> facilitate their exploitation and uptake.
> - It is important to emphasize that the outcomes of these projects should not only benefit the regions directly involved but
> also have a broader reach. This includes sharing the lessons learned, methodologies developed, and successful strategies
> implemented with other projects within the other mission, such as the EU-Mission on cities. By disseminating these
> outcomes across different missions, there is an opportunity to enhance the collective knowledge and impact of EU
> initiatives aimed at addressing climate adaptation challenges.
> - Making the results of the projects more visible as a united action to support climate change adaptation in regions. By
> consolidating the work and outputs of different projects into a unified space, it becomes possible to leverage the synergies
> between them and create a stronger and more comprehensive approach to tackling climate adaptation challenges. This
> Page 4 of 15
> integrated space can serve as a platform for testing and refining the application of various tools, as well as for exploring
> how the innovations from each project can be effectively combined and harmonized
> - Please consider the local languages and the possible use of AI for translating to increase the use of projects outcomes
> by non-English speakers.

> 2. Objectives and workplan
> 1. Is the progress reported in line with objectives and work plan as specified in the DoA?
> If there are significant deviations, please comment.
> Yes
> The project as a whole has been making good progress in relation to the DoA. Progress to achieve each of the objectives
> has been made. More precisely:
> Objective 1 (means of realisation WP1 and WP7): the activation of Innovation Ecosystems was ensured, with good
> deliverables providing stakeholder engagement guidelines and LDs baseline profiles. In WP1, the consortium has
> decided to merge the ‘Stakeholder Advisory Board’ activities under WP1 with the ‘Community of Practice’ activities
> of WP7 under the name ‘Network on Climate Change Adaptation’
> . The difference between these activities, actors and
> deliverables should be examined in detail. The allocated budgets, roles of responsible partners for these activities need
> to be revisited. In the next reporting periods, specific attention has to be dedicated to the inclusion of heterogeneous
> groups of stakeholders in all LDs. Inclusiveness of different stakeholders has to be ensured all along the development
> and implementation of the transformational adaptation pathways.
> Objective 2 (means of realisation WP2): good progress has been made to deliver user-friendly, accessible and
> comprehensive multi sector dynamics data services. In the next reporting periods specific attention should be dedicated
> to the following issues: i) the socio-economic impact assessment of climate change is no further delayed; ii) the links
> between the bio-physical and economic models are strengthened; iii) the inclusion of model results in the implementation
> of the 22 actionable adaptive solutions is ensured.
> Objective 3 (means of realisation WP3): this objective has only partially been met in this reporting period, as originally
> planned. As highlighted in the periodic report, quantitative assessments (e.g. minimization of climate risk losses and
> evaluation of multi-sector socio-economic benefits) are expected for the next reporting periods. More precisely, D3.4 is
> expected to contribute to a better understanding of the added value, and potential trade-offs, of adaptation solutions.
> Objective 4 (means of realization WP4): the WP linked to this objective kicked-off in September 2022. Good progress
> has been made so far, even if these are only the early stages to achieve this objective. For the next reporting periods, it
> will be critical to ensure that sufficient human and economic resources are dedicated to the implementation of the some
> solutions, e.g. nature-based solutions requiring procurement processes.
> Objective 5 (means of realization WP5): this objective has only partially been met in this reporting period, as originally
> planned. Good progress has been made concerning bankability and innovative financial schemes. Laudable that the
> partners have identified a list of practical actions/financial schemes in the LDs for future implementation (see progress
> report).
> Objective 6 (means of realization WP6): this objective has only partially been met in this reporting period. In WP6, delays
> have been encountered. They were caused by the complexity of the work, two rounds of testing and the procurement
> of a subcontractor to implement the survey. This issue should be monitored. A detailed documentation of surveys and
> analyses should be provided in the next reporting period.
> In WP8, there is a position change. An expert member, Linda Romanovska, will act as a 10% FTE researcher.
> 2. Are the objectives of the project still scientifically and /or technologically relevant? Yes
> The project objectives are still valid and technologically relevant if the following items are ensured:
> ● Sustainable integration of local data sources/business models,
> ● Concrete business/exploitation plan to reach wider users to sustain the project.
> 3. Are the critical implementation risks and mitigation actions described in the DoA still
> relevant?
> Partially
> The same critical implementation risks apply. The preliminary risk assessment presented in the management plan (D8.2)
> should be updated and risk mitigation measures should clearly be identified. Overall, the consortium has shown to
> be aware of the critical points that need to be addressed in the next reporting periods. Particularly critical are the
> potential barriers (e.g. lengthy procurement processes, administrative barriers. etc.) linked to the adaptation solutions
> implementation. Lessons learnt from past and ongoing EC innovation actions - e.g. implementing climate adaptation
> solutions - can help the consortium to address these barriers and continue their successful path. Also, risks relevant
> to exploitation and collaboration with other projects, are not foreseen and should be added. New risks and relevant
> mitigation measures need to be included in the next reporting period.
> Page 6 of 15
> 4. Have the pilots/case studies started to showcase innovative results as described in the
> Yes
> DoA?
> The implementation of the transformational adaptation pathways in the six LDs started to showcase innovative results.
> The consortium already organized a total of 16 workshops in the LDs with stakeholders from different domains. Laudable
> efforts have been undertaken by the consortium to organize the workshops in such a short time-frame. This is an
> extraordinary achievement for the first reporting period. Key innovations need to be identified clearly.
> 5. Have the ethics deliverables due for the current period been adequately addressed and
> approved?
> Yes
> The ethics deliverables due for the current period have been adequately addressed. These deliverables need to be
> elaborated in more detail in the forthcoming reporting period.
> 6. Have the comments and recommendations from previous project reviews been taken
> into account?
> Not applicable
> Page 7 of 15
> 3. Impact
> 1. Does the work carried out contribute to the expected impacts detailed in the DoA? Partially
> Overall, TransformAr is seemingly progressing well towards achieving its expected impacts. The progress report includes
> the list of expected impacts, but not the progress towards their achievement in this reporting period. For the next reporting
> periods, the expected projects impacts should be monitored more systematically, as expected in D8.4.
> 2. Does the work carried out follow the plan detailed in the DoA to enhance innovation
> capacity, create new markets opportunities, strengthen competitiveness and growth of
> companies, address issues related to climate change or the environment, address industrial
> and/or societal needs at regional level or bring other important benefits for society? Give
> information on the relevant innovation activities carried out (prototypes, testing activities,
> standards, clinical trials) and/or new product, service, reference materials, process or
> method (to be) launched to the market, if any.
> Yes
> Create new markets opportunities (YES, in progress); strengthen competitiveness and growth of companies (NO);
> address issues related to climate change or the environment (YES); address industrial and/or societal needs at regional
> level or bring other important benefits for society (YES).
> The innovation capacity of the project has been demonstrated in creating new services customized for climate change
> adaptation. However, the project did not list any significant innovation-related accomplishments for this reporting period.
> Still, the challenges being tackled include those related to climate change and the environment, where significant local,
> regional, and EU-scale benefits are anticipated upon the successful completion of the project's objectives.
> LDs activities are already launched and these processes can be considered as prototypes. The Playbook and related
> deliverables can be the first step towards a standard for the implementation of transformational adaptation pathways.
> Innovation emerges primarily from the adoption of a pathway approach, and integration of different types of knowledge
> and disciplines. The application and implementation of adaptation pathways (including toolkits and guidelines) could
> be seen as a new service or process for companies or administrations.
> WP2 and WP5 outcomes also have the potential to create new market opportunities for the private sector (e.g. innovative
> financial schemes, public private partnerships, green bonds, insurance mechanisms, etc.). Importantly, the project is still
> at an early stage of development. Most of the contributions in this area are expected to become evident during the next
> reporting periods.
> 3. Does the work carried out contribute towards European policy objectives and strategies
> and have an impact on policy making?
> Partially
> The TransformAr project's scope is highly relevant to the policies relating to the environment, water, and climate change.
> The biggest contribution will probably be the plans for coping with climate change. The project's objective is to involve
> participants at the local, regional, and EU levels, and the first reporting period has been fruitful and encouraging.
> Moreover, as revealed by the project findings (e.g. D3.2.), TransformAr can contribute to several policy objectives at
> EU or Member States (MS) level focusing specifically on climate adaptation. Partnering with sister projects to generate
> policy impact is also advisable. Overall, the project is still at an early stage of development. The foundations to contribute
> towards European policy objectives are being laid, but it is early to find clear evidence of this impact. Most of the impacts
> on policy making are expected to become evident during the next years of the project and beyond. There is high potential
> to influence local and regional policies in the LDs.
> 4. Does (or will) the work carried out have an impact on SMEs? Partially
> So far, the work carried out seemingly had only minor impacts on SMEs. Solid foundations have been laid, e.g. by
> including private sector actors in the stakeholder matrix conducted in D1.2, by engaging private sector representatives
> in some LDs workshops in WP3, by providing financial schemes targeted for specific sectors (e.g. insurance or
> potential investors) in WP6 etc. However, the role of SMEs needs to be better defined in the next reporting periods.
> Different sectors work at different governmental levels (from national to local) and have different priorities. Where can
> TransformAr really make the difference? More efforts can be done to narrow down the scope, improve clarity concerning
> SMEs engagement and provide more information about it.
> 5. Have the beneficiaries reached gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the
> action? If not, have the reasons been explained in the periodic report?
> Yes
> Beneficiaries reached gender balance at multiple levels: team/personnel involved in the project, WP or task leadership,
> first authorship of deliverables. This is well-addressed in the “Quality Plan”, D.8.1.
> Page 8 of 15
> 4. Implementation
> 1. Has the project been efficiently and effectively managed? Yes
> The project has been managed efficiently and effectively. There are no significant deviations from the work plan.
> 2. Is the management of the project in line with the obligations of beneficiaries (including
> ethics and security requirements, risk and innovation management if applicable)?
> Yes
> The management of the project has been in accordance with the beneficiaries' obligations and has been adequate to the
> complexity of the project. Currently, there is not sufficient information provided on innovation and IPRs.
> 3. Is the contribution of each beneficiary in line with the work committed in the DoA?
> (applicable only to multibeneficiary projects)
> Yes
> Yes, only minor deviations in deadlines have been found. But the work has been successfully carried out.
> 4. Have the beneficiaries disseminated project results (foreground) in scientific
> publications as planned in the DoA (including the deposition of publications in open access
> repositories)? Do they include a reference to EU funding?
> Partially
> The dissemination activities of project results, especially scientific publications, are limited. The consortium has included
> the reference to EU funding on project web-site.
> No scientific publications have been reported in the progress report (except a conference proceeding). Overall, there is a
> rather low output of reported scientific publications. Writing scientific publications in projects with a strong co-creation
> basis as TransformAr can be a demanding task; also, scientific publications are not the key outcome of innovation actions.
> However, the consortium should make sure that it still manages to contribute profoundly to the scientific discussion to
> promote innovation at multiple levels and in multiple communities. Scientific achievements should be aimed at in all
> WPs during the next reporting periods.
> The other dissemination activities such as social media, press-release, the project web site, video/film, etc are well
> elaborated.
> 5. Have the beneficiaries disseminated and communicated project activities and results by
> other means than scientific publications (social media, press-release, the project web site,
> video/film, etc) as planned in the DoA? Do they include a reference to EU funding?
> Yes
> So far, the dissemination and communication of results has been implemented in an appropriate way. For the next
> reporting period, more attention should be dedicated to the dissemination in the language of the LDs.
> 6. Has the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results (if required) been
> updated and implemented as described in the DoA, in particular as regards intellectual
> property rights? Is it appropriate?
> Partially
> The exploitable products and innovative outputs of the project should be identified more clearly in the exploitation plan.
> Also, the methodology for exploitation is not clearly stated.There is need of plan for IPRs. More details concerning the
> exploitation plan revision request are provided in Annex 1 (D6.6 comments).
> 7. Has the data management plan (DMP) (if required) been updated and implemented?
> Is it appropriate?
> Yes
> The data management plan is adequate for this phase of the project. Two updates of the DMP are foreseen. The methods
> for accessing the data should be elaborated in detail in the forthcoming reporting period.
> 8. Have the proposed institutional changes been appropriately promoted? Not applicable
> Page 9 of 15
> 5. Resources
> 1. Were the resources used as described in the DoA and were they necessary to achieve
> its objectives? If there are deviations from planned budget, have they been satisfactorily
> explained? Have they been used in a manner consistent with the principle of sound
> financial management (in particular economy, efficiency and effectiveness)?
> Yes
> Resources were used as planned in the DoA. The person months reported for each partner are consistent with their
> reported involvement in the relevant tasks and with the completion of the tasks relevant for this reporting period. There
> were no major deviations from the planned budget. The progress report describes the process to contract the survey
> company for WP6 (p.62). Yet, it is not entirely clear if Dynata -the selected survey company- will be sub-contracted and
> if this will imply a resources shift between partners.
> One of the partners, namely PIK, will be active in the forthcoming reporting periods. This has been justified.

> I am writing a review of the second phase. What items from this review are relevant to my work (e.g., things that needed to be addressed)?
**assistant**:
> When reviewing the second phase of the TransformAr project, focus on the recommendations and areas needing improvement from the first phase review. Here are the key items to address:
> 
> 1. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
>    - Ensure inclusivity by involving heterogeneous stakeholder groups in all Lightouse Demonstrators (LDs). Consider quota systems or supplementary interviews to incorporate diverse perspectives.
>    - Address barriers to inclusive stakeholder engagement and reflect critically on them.
> 
> 2. **Exploitation Plans:**
>    - Improve the preliminary exploitation plan by clearly identifying key exploitable results and stating the methodology for exploitation. Make sure Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) plans are in place.
> 
> 3. **Data Sets and Accessibility:**
>    - Make data sets, sources, models, and data quality information for LDs more explicitly available and potentially enrich the planned repository with additional baseline information.
> 
> 4. **Concrete Adaptation Pathways:**
>    - Make adaptation pathways as concrete and practical as possible to implement the 22 actionable adaptive solutions before the project ends.
> 
> 5. **Innovation and Impact:**
>    - Clearly identify and promote key innovations in the LDs and beyond, reflecting on both outcomes and processes. Recognize and articulate the innovative aspects of the project.
>    - Monitor and systematically document expected impacts in the demonstrators and their influence on policy.
> 
> 6. **Scientific Publications and Dissemination:**
>    - Increase contributions to scientific literature, ensuring publications are targeted at promoting innovation and contribute to broader scientific discussions.
> 
> 7. **Risks and Mitigation:**
>    - Update the preliminary risk assessment and ensure relevant mitigation measures, notably concerning innovation exploitation and collaboration with other projects.
> 
> 8. **Collaboration and Synergies:**
>    - Establish a collaborative framework with sister projects, identifying synergies and avoiding competition. Consider organizing workshops and SWOT analyses to explore risks and bottlenecks early on.
> 
> 9. **Exploitation Metrics:**
>    - Provide metrics for exploitation performance to clearly determine the project's success in reaching wider audiences and sustaining efforts post-completion.
> 
> Addressing these points will demonstrate responsiveness to the first phase's feedback and highlight progress areas in the second phase review.
