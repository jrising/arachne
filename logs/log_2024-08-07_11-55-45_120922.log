> 
> Building code- there is a lot of background that I won’t go into here, but we will need some help in this next three-year IECC cycle as we attempt to undo some code that is starting to squeeze our products out of certain regions in the country.
> Research projects- we would love to explore some collaborations with you where appropriate. This could extend to case studies, which we do not have and do not have the staff to help with in the US.
> Exposure- to your audiences who may not have considered increased natural light in their retrofits and new builds.
>  
> 
> When I meet people and tell them where I work, 95% of the time the person says, “Oh, don’t skylights leak?” or “I would never get skylights because they leak.” This is the biggest hurdle to acceptance and adoption because skylights DO leak. The old ones from the 70s and 80s that no one ever bothered to replace, NOT our product. As the market leader for skylights and solar tubes, it’s on VELUX to change the reputation."
