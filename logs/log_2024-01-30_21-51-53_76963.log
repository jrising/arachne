**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon a report (Dewberry Engineers 2018) which has identified the following issues and data requirements for Maritime and navigation safety:
> 
> Issues:
> • Maintain safety of shipping and other vessels
> • Increase global ocean trade
> • Manage port facilities
> • Maintain shipping and navigation channels,
> harbors, and ports
> • Manage conflicting uses by recreational
> fishing, tour boats, and charter fishing boats
> • Ensure proposed projects do not impact
> shipping channels
> 
> Data requirements
> • Jurisdictions and regulated areas
> • Synthesized oceanographic parameters,
> including waves and currents
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel
> Monitoring System (VMS)
> • Vessel Traffic – Automatic Identification
> Systems (AIS)
> • Human and cultural use areas
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel Trip
> Report (VTR)
> • Bathymetry
> • Sand and borrow sites
> • Locations of onshore and offshore facilities
> • Recent aerial imagery
> Can you provide a brief summary of this material, citing the source, with a view toward data gaps relevant to Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process? Please do not list every item in these lists.
**assistant**:
> Sure, here is a brief summary highlighting key components of the material:
> 
> Drawing from the insights outlined in Dewberry Engineers (2018), the Delaware ocean and bay spatial planning process must acknowledge critical aspects where data may be lacking. Maritime and navigation safety demands attention, considering potential conflicts between commercial, recreational, and various service vessels. For instance, the safety of shipping channels and managing possible conflicts from tour boats and charter fishing boats pose challenges.
> 
> Data requirements identified in the report underscore the importance of accessible and comprehensive information for operational and planning purposes. A few crucial datasets might include vessel monitoring systems (VMS) concerning commercial fishing activity, automatic identification systems (AIS) tracking vessel traffic, synthesized oceanographic parameters, and human and cultural use areas. Other crucial datasets with possible gaps are bathymetry, recent aerial imagery, and the locations of on- and off-shore facilities.
> 
> Overall, careful attention to these specific points may support the unimpeded growth of global ocean trade, maintenance of port facilities, and most crucially, the safety of the diverse range of vessels operating in the Delaware ocean and bay areas.
