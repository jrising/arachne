> Please draft a response for me to this prompt: 
> "what was a high-impact engagement campaign or program you have led.Please share an example of a high-impact engagement campaign or program you have led. What was your goal? How did you get there and how did you motivate your teammates and collaborators? What was the outcome?"
**assistant**:
> In responding to that prompt, Johanna could draw upon her experience leading the membership network growth at Clean Energy Buyers Association. Here's a potential response:
> 
> ---
> One of the significant high-impact campaigns I've had the privilege to lead was while serving as the Manager of Strategic Partnerships at the Clean Energy Buyers Association. The objective was to grow the membership network of clean energy buyers, energy, and service providers.
> 
> Strategically, we understood that to make a big impact, we needed to increase the number and diversity of stakeholders actively involved in supporting clean energy. The success indicator was clear: a significant increase in the number of corporate participants within our association.
> 
> My approach to achieving this goal was both pragmatic and passionate. I ensured that every team member was aligned with our objective by emphasizing the impact their work would have on the future of the clean energy sector. I fuelled motivation with clear communication of each person's role in relation to the overarching goal and celebrated every incremental success.
> 
> In addition to managing the internal team, I fostered business partnerships and expanded networks, building credibility and mutual trust with key stakeholders. The act of constructing relationships was systematic— highlights included the development of the company's first Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion program, offering a discounted rate to companies led by women and people of color.
> 
> The outcome exceeded expectations. We were able to grow our membership network from 200 to over 400 corporate participants. These companies represented $7.5 trillion in annual revenue. This growth was not just quantitative but qualitatively diverse, democratising access to clean energy for a wider range of businesses. We also facilitated deals that brought over 64 Gigawatts of clean energy to the grid, ushering in essential strides towards a sustainable future.
> 
> Moreover, the teamwork, cross-functional collaboration, and strengthened relationships that were a consequence of this work persist, adding enduring value to our ongoing initiatives.
