> Can you tell me the story of Star Wars, as a chapter book?
**assistant**:
> Oh, I'd love to tell that story, Austin! This version will be a bit simplified for you.
> 
> Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a brave and kind young man named Luke Skywalker. Living on Tatooine, he dreams of exciting adventures, just like a pirate! But little did Luke know, he was actually very special.
> 
> One day, Luke finds two friendly droids named R2-D2 and C-3PO. They've got a secret message from Princess Leia, asking for help! Leia is a very brave Princess, just like the Disney princesses you love, but unlike them, she leads a whole rebel army against some bad guys.
> 
> As he goes off on his adventure to save Princess Leia, he meets a wise, old man named Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan trains Luke to be a Jedi, powerful warriors who use lightsabers - much cooler than normal swords! 
> 
> Along the way, they meet space pirate Han Solo and his fuzzy friend Chewbacca. Together, they confront the bad guys, led by Darth Vader and rescue Princess Leia. Can you imagine battling against lights and sounds, like a grand sword fight with Darth Vader?!
> 
> In the end, good triumphs over the bad, but the story doesn't end there. There are many more chapters in the Star Wars saga.
> 
> How would you feel if you found a secret message from a princess, Austin?
