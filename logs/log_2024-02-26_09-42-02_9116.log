> Dear James,
> 
> I just wanted to send a note to thank you for taking the time to meet with me this week. I enjoyed getting to know you and hearing about your research and teaching. In particular, I appreciated your questions about the role of economics in my work, and your comment about just transitions, which got me thinking.
> 
> I really enjoyed my visits to both the Newark and Lewes campuses and was impressed by my conversations with faculty and students. Clearly a lot of exciting things happening in the SMSP and at UD more broadly.
> 
> Please don't hesitate to reach out with any other questions. In particular, now that I've had some more time to think through the Marine Policy class, happy to write up some detailed thoughts on how I might teach that, if that would be useful. I hope to work with you soon!
