**user**:
> I have two categorical distributions in Julia (just represented as a vector of unnormalized probabilities each). They describe the same categories, but draws from them are independent. I want to sample from these two multiple times until I get the same category selected by both of them. How can I do this in Julia?
**assistant**:
> Here is a general way of achieving what you are asking for in Julia. This first assumes the two categorical distributions are represented as unnormalized probability vectors, then it normalizes them, and repeatedly draws from each until it gets a match. This makes use of Julia's built-in `sample()` function from the Random library, which straightforwardly allows for weights to be specified.

> 
> function sample_until_match(p1::Vector{Float64}, p2::Vector{Float64})
>     # Normalize probabilities
>     p1_normalized = p1 / sum(p1)
>     p2_normalized = p2 / sum(p2)
>

>         draw1 = sample(1:n, Weights(p1_normalized))
>         draw2 = sample(1:n, Weights(p2_normalized))

> This function takes as input two vectors, `p1` and `p2`, representing the unnormalized probabilities of each category for each of the two distributions. It then normalizes these probabilities and starts a loop where it continually samples one category from each distribution according to these probabilities, until they match. It then returns the category number of the match.

> Keep in mind that due to the random nature of the sampling process, the number of iterations (and hence time) it takes to find a match may vary.
**user**:
> Is there a mathematical way to find out what the probability of each category being the final chosen category is, given the vectors of probabilities?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is a mathematical way to determine the probability of each category being the final chosen category, given the vectors of probabilities. This can be done by calculating the joint distribution of the two categorical variables.
> 
> To find the probability of each category being the final chosen category, you can multiply the probabilities of selecting each category from the two distributions. The resulting probability will be the product of the probability of selecting the category from the first distribution and the probability of selecting the same category from the second distribution.
> 
> Here's an example code snippet that calculates the probabilities:

>         for j in 1:n
>             probabilities[i, j] = p1_normalized[i] * p2_normalized[j]
>         end
>     end

>     # Calculate the probability of each category being the final chosen category
>     final_probabilities = sum(probabilities, dims=2)

>     return final_probabilities
> end
> ```
> 
> This function takes the same inputs as before (`p1` and `p2`), normalizes the probabilities, and creates a probability matrix `probabilities`. This matrix stores the joint probabilities of selecting each category from the two distributions. Finally, it sums up the probabilities along the rows of the matrix to obtain the probability of each category being the final chosen category (`final_probabilities`).
> 
> By calling this function, you can get a vector of probabilities where each element represents the probability of the corresponding category being the final chosen category.
