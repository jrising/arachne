> what are some measureable goals for the infomation below: The Greater Washington region is challenged by outdated, energy-inefficient building infrastructure, and a workforce that is unprepared to rectify infrastructure issues in a way that maximizes energy, environmental, and economic performance. These problems need to be addressed jointly to achieve regional social and environmental objectives like fostering equity in infrastructure, aiding disadvantaged communities, and decreasing carbon emissions.
> The Hub understands that to accomplish our goal of improving the built environment in the DC metropolitan area, we must have a trained and committed workforce that is primed to participate fully in the green economy. IMT proposes two new green workforce development opportunities to train diverse DC-region residents for well-paying jobs in construction, facilities management, high-efficiency equipment installation, and more.
> DC Region Green Buildings Career Map: A dynamic map that links Washington DC-area job seekers with green building career opportunities, pathways, and information they need to successfully obtain employment. 
> Vendor matchmaking service to include more businesses, and connect the service with our contractor accelerator graduates. This will be a database for contractors to serve as a central resource hub that simplifies access to existing training programs (government, private, etc.) and builds upon the DC Region Green Buildings Career Map and our BIPOC Contractor Accelerator initiatives.
