> Are divorce rates higher in wealthier countries?
**assistant**:
> There is some evidence that divorce rates may be higher in wealthier countries, but the relationship between wealth and divorce is complex and not fully understood. 
> 
> One study found that divorce rates are generally higher in countries with higher levels of economic development and gender equality. However, other factors such as cultural and religious attitudes towards divorce, the availability of divorce as a legal option, and individual characteristics such as age and education may also play a role.
> 
> It is also important to note that divorce rates can vary widely within a country and may be influenced by factors such as geographic location and socio-economic status. Overall, the relationship between wealth and divorce is likely to be multifaceted and dependent on a variety of factors.
