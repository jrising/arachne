> The substitution possibilities for dependent sectors become more limited or even chronically impaired as the size of the shock or hazard increases. Recent studies have shown that by compounded climatological effects, the rainforest is losing resilience. This can increase the frequency or size of shocks. As the forest continues to degrade, the effectiveness of substitution methods may therefore decline, and risks may compound via complementary and interconnected ecosystem services. To illustrate, farmers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to mitigate impacts from severe drought shocks. This was visible between June 2021 and June 2022 when a severe drought decreased Brazil's national agribusiness earnings by 5.5% compared to the previous year. This drought also resulted in significant losses to the insurance industry.

> The extent to which operations further down the value chain can substitute geographically might also be restricted by the widespread global degradation of tropical forests and an increase of policy action to protect these vulnerable ecosystems. Southeast Asia is home to nearly 15 percent of the world’s tropical forests and is losing at least 1.2 percent of its forests annually due to palm oil production, logging, and agriculture. Similarly, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, nearly 4 million hectares of African tropical forests are lost each year. These developments restrict the ability to rely on the necessary ecosystem services in other locations.

> This phase illustrates the transmission of economic risks stemming from the Amazon's degradation to the financial sector. The assessment points towards some of the traditional risk categories that may be affected as a result of, among other things: heightened operational risks due to natural hazards, increased business risks as degraded soil quality prevents the cultivation of certain crops, and market risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices. The assessment also illustrates how systemic risks may occur, for instance as a result of concentrated exposures to high-impact sectors. By financing high impact activities, such as beef and soy production, the financial sector affects the degradation of the Amazon and the risks that stem from this.

> The economic risks stemming from the degradation of the Amazon can transmit to the financial system via traditional financial risk categories. For example, recent research by the World Bank explores how banks can be exposed to the loss of biodiversity through their lending activities. It shows that 46 percent of Brazilian banks' corporate loan portfolio is concentrated in sectors dependent on ecosystem services flowing from the Amazon. Furthermore, losses from ecosystem service collapse could translate to a 9 percentage point increase in corporate non-performing loans. The details illustrate how the Amazon's degradation could affect strategic and business model, credit, market, and operational risks.
