> Subject: Updates on Comms and Development Teams' Calendar Management and Stewardship Activities
> 
> Dear team, 
> 
> We are writing to provide an update on how our calendar planning will proceed moving forward for the Communications and Development teams. 
> 
> Based on the ongoing workflow, we have decided to maintain unique calendars for both teams to streamline our different activities. Relevant information and events will be copied over to each team's calendar as necessary to ensure synchronization of our efforts.
> 
> We want to highlight some of the stewardship activities that involve collaboration between the Development and Communications teams. These include:
> 
> 1. **Philanthropic Stewardship:**
>     - **Quarterly donor shoutouts** in the IMT newsletter, with information also published on LinkedIn. We're considering enhancing this recognition with an engaging 2-question interview or a similar feature.
>     - Distribution of a **biannual philanthropic funder-specific newsletter** brimming with statistics, testimonials, and updates on our progress. To make each funder feel valued and connected with our work, these will be sent via YAMM, separate from our regular communications on Mailchimp. 
>     - The development of **Regional Cohort specific touchpoints** is under consideration. While we're still refining these details, one key element will be spotlighting how we are supporting Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in each region. 
>     - Continuing to share our **EOY/Impact report outreach**, just as we've done in the past. These give our supporters a personalized update on our work and are not intended as funding requests.
>     - Lastly, we plan to include an **annual check-in, organized by sbk**. While this activity does not directly involve the Communications team, it is important that it is tracked on our shared calendar.
> 
> We believe these initiatives will strengthen our stewardship endeavors, enrich our relationships with our funders and cohorts, and amplify the positive impacts we're making. Further details and meeting invites will be added to our respective calendars soon. 
> 
> Your cooperation and mutual support are anticipated as we work towards our common goals.

> Subject: Update on Calendar Management for Communications and Development Teams
> 
> Dear Team Members,
> 
> I am writing to inform you about a change in how we will be managing calendars for the Communications and Development teams. Moving forward, we will maintain separate calendars for each team and transfer relevant event information as needed to ensure alignment between our activities.
> 
> Several stewardship activities that involve collaboration between the Development and Communications teams have been identified. These include:
> 
> 1. **Philanthropic Stewardship:**
>    - Quarterly donor shoutouts in the IMT newsletter, with corresponding posts on LinkedIn. To enhance these acknowledgments, we are considering incorporating a 2-question interview or an engaging feature instead of a simple thank you and logo.
>    - Sending out a biannual philanthropic funder-specific newsletter containing substantial statistics, testimonials, and updates. To maintain a personalized touch, these newsletters will be distributed through YAMM instead of Mailchimp.
>    - Exploring Regional Cohort specific touchpoints. While the specifics are still being refined, this will likely involve a partner spotlight showcasing our support for Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in each region.
>    - Continuing the tradition of sharing EOY/Impact report outreach as we have done in the past. These updates are aimed at providing a personalized insight into our progress and are not intended as funding requests.
>    - Scheduling an annual check-in organized by sbk. Although this activity does not fall under the Communications team's purview, it is crucial to include it on our calendars.
> 
> By maintaining clear calendars for each team and transferring relevant information, we aim to streamline our efforts, enhance collaboration, and ensure the success of our joint stewardship activities. Additional details and meeting invitations will be shared soon on our respective calendars.
> 
> Your cooperation and dedication to these initiatives are greatly appreciated as we work together to achieve our common goals.
