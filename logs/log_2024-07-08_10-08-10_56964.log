> I am doing a global sensitivity analysis, but when I plot the results I want to combine up the values into groups-- for example, the first three parameters all relate to climate sensitivity. What is the right way to combine the importance of multiple parameters for a GSA? Do I sum them, or is it like a square-root-of-sum-of-squares like adding standard deviations?

> Combining the importance of multiple parameters in a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is indeed a nuanced task. The method depends on whether the sensitivity indices are additive or not.

> ### For Additive Sensitivity Indices
> If the sensitivity indices are additive, you can simply sum them up. This works well for first-order indices (main effects) or total-order indices, where each index represents the contribution of a parameter to the output variance.
> 
> For example, if you have three parameters related to climate sensitivity (let’s call them \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \)), then the combined sensitivity index \( S_{combined} \) would be:
> \[ S_{combined} = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \]
> 
> ### For Non-Additive Sensitivity Indices
> For indices that aren't strictly additive, such as Sobol' second-order or higher-order indices, a more conservative approximation might be useful. 
> 
> ### Root Sum of Squares
> Another approach is to consider the sensitivities as orthogonal (uncorrelated) contributions and use the root sum of squares method. This method is akin to combining standard deviations. It is more conservative than simple addition because it accounts for uncorrelated contributions:
> 
> \[ S_{combined} = \sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2} \]
> 
> This method provides a measure that reflects the combined effect of the parameters while acknowledging that they might not perfectly align.
> 
> ### Practical Steps
> 
> 1. **Identify Groups**: Clearly define which parameters belong to which conceptual groups in your model.
> 2. **Calculate Indices**: Compute the first-order and total-order sensitivity indices for each parameter.
> 3. **Combine Indices**: Depending on whether the indices are additive or non-additive, use either summation or root sum of squares.

> Here’s a quick example using Python and the SALib library:
> 
> ```python
> import numpy as np
> from SALib.analyze import sobol
> from SALib.sample import saltelli
> 
> # Define your model input parameters and problem statement
> problem = {
>     'num_vars': 3,
>     'names': ['Param1', 'Param2', 'Param3'],
>     'bounds': [[0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]]
> }
> 
> # Generate samples
> param_values = saltelli.sample(problem, 1000)
> 
> # Evaluate your model
> Y = model_function(param_values)  # replace with your model function
> 
> # Perform Sobol' analysis
> Si = sobol.analyze(problem, Y)
> 
> # Extract first-order sensitivity indices
> S1 = Si['S1']
> 
> # Combine indices for your climate sensitivity parameters
> combined_S = np.sqrt(S1[0]**2 + S1[1]**2 + S1[2]**2)
> 
> print(f"Combined sensitivity index for climate sensitivity: {combined_S}")
> ```
