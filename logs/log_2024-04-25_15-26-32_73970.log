> Abstract: Tradeoffs between climate change mitigation and adaptation policies are explored under both certainty and uncertainty with learning using a numerical two-period decision model. We first replicate a version of the Adaptation in DICE climate model (AD-DICE) (de Bruin et al., 2009), which modifies the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000) to incorporate climate change adaptation explicitly into the traditional optimisation framework. Our model is then extended to include uncertainty over a probability distribution of expected Climate Sensitivity (CS) values and the implications for optimal mitigation and adaptation levels are then explored. In the certainty model runs, the results of previous studies that incorporated adaptation into the portfolio of climate change responses are largely confirmed. Modelling an uncertain CS with the same expected value as under certainty leads to several insights:
>   • before learning occurs, optimal levels of both mitigation and adaptation are lower under uncertainty than under certainty
> • in this same early period, optimal mitigation and adaptation levels are most sensitive to the respective cost of each strategy, with the mitigation level more dependent on adaptation costs than vice versa
> • variance in CS – a parameter with long-term effects – affects mitigation levels more than adaptation levels.

> 1 Introduction
> Some significant amount of global warming is unavoidable. With a likely minimum warming of 1.8°C over this century (IPCC, 2007a), the global warming commitment means that any optimal least-cost response to climate change will include a portfolio of both mitigation and adaptation efforts (Ingham et al., 2005b; Settle et al., 2007). Indeed, as decadal average warming to 2030 is predicted to be insensitive to the occurrence of any particular IPCC emissions scenario (IPCC, 2007a), adaptation is for now the only way to cope with the inevitable climate change impacts that will occur over the next few decades (Stern, 2006b). Adaptation spending will thus likely experience growing political support as the effects of climate change are felt and mitigation efforts produce no observable effects either on near-term average global temperatures or climate change damages.
> Climate change mitigation is here defined as the reduction of atmospheric Greenhouse Gas (GHG) concentrations via emissions abatement or carbon sequestration. Adaptation to climate change can be defined as the human adjustment to economic, social, or environmental systems in response to actual or expected climatic changes (Smit et al., 2000). Mitigation and adaptation are related in that they both work to reduce the equivalent outcomes of human risk exposure to climate change, and the actual climate damages themselves. They also both have significant ‘co-benefits’, i.e., positive effects that are completely unrelated to climate change such as a reduction in air particulate levels in the case of mitigation. Yet the two strategies differ in terms of their costs, benefit lag times, and environmental effects. Mitigation and adaptation are in most cases substitutes (Ingham et al., 2005a–b; Tol, 2005a). To achieve the same policy goal, more of one strategy requires less of the other. Implementation of both strategies at the same time affects both the risks posed by climate change and the costs to reduce them (Wilbanks et al., 2003). In an optimal policy mix both will be implemented to reflect their perceived cost-benefit ratios in each time period.
> Analysis of the inclusion of adaptation as a policy response to climate change has been done for adaptation alone (Fankhauser et al., 1999; Mendelsohn, 2000), and for mitigation and adaptation together in both static (Kane and Shogren, 2000) and dynamic

> optimisations (Settle et al., 2007). Dynamic optimisations with both strategies include efforts to integrate adaptation into existing integrated climate-economy models of climate change policy such as the Adaptation in DICE model (AD-DICE) (de Bruin et al., 2009), or PAGE (Hope, 2006; Hope et al., 1993) models. Analyses with these models under certainty yield fairly intuitive results. Under hypothetical ideal conditions, rational actors operating with complete and certain information will choose to adapt as well as mitigate, and will aspire to optimise this choice in a policy mix over time. Adaptation reduces the costs of climate change damages and, under assumptions of rationality, will be implemented only if economically worthwhile from a cost benefit perspective. As expected, including the option to adapt to climate change impacts while they occur (as well as mitigate future damages through GHG emissions abatement) thus reduces overall net costs.
> A less obvious question is how should we divide our limited budget between adaptation and mitigation in the near-term under uncertainty, if that uncertainty will later be resolved or reduced. This study characterises and explores the sensitivity of optimal choice paths for mitigation and adaptation under both certainty and the more realistic condition of uncertainty. To conduct this analysis we first replicate a version of the AD-DICE model (de Bruin et al., 2009). We then incorporate a two-stage decision under uncertainty, with learning. Finally, we conducted several policy runs and sensitivity analyses to further explore the relationship between mitigation and adaptation.
> 2 Background
> 2.1 Mitigation and the reduction of climate change risk
> Humans may employ either or both of two fundamental strategies to address global climate change: mitigation or adaptation. (Alternative responses such as geoengineering or a ‘do nothing’ strategy that instead focuses on economic development are not addressed in this study.) Climate change mitigation is forward-looking and preventative and, as opposed to adaptation, has also received the bulk of scientific and political attention to date. In the often-used characterisation, mitigation reduces the likelihood of future climate damages, while adaptation reduces the severity of those damages (Easterling et al., 2004). As Settle et al. (2007) argue, mitigation is “a reduction in risk by curtailing [GHG] emissions to lower the likelihood that a bad state of nature occurs; adaptation lowers the damages by altering production, consumption and time-use decisions to reduce the severity of a bad state if it does occur”.
> Figure 1 provides a simple diagram of this mitigation-adaptation dichotomy and its relation to climate change damages, with the damage examples and curve shapes chosen for illustrative purposes only. A mitigation policy is first implemented, which results in the realisation of one of the two different Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of climate change damages. In this example, choosing a mitigation policy with the more stringent 2.5°C temperature ceiling, as opposed to a 3.5°C one, eliminates the risk that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will break up and melt and significantly lowers the probability of a hurricane hitting New York City. This framework has been utilised before (Webster et al., 2003), where various emissions abatement policies reduce but do not completely eliminate the chances of substantial warming (and, hence, the risk of substantial damages). The uncertainty range of future climate damages also shrinks with
> 
> The optimal paths of climate change mitigation and adaptation 69
> the lower temperature estimates, as is reflected in the different shapes of the 3.5°C and 2.5°C damage distributions before adaptation. In the second stage of the policy response the actual climate damages are apparent and adaptation is undertaken to reduce them, which moves the decision maker’s realised climate damage distribution to that of the dashed line. Sequencing is implicitly assumed: first comes mitigation, then comes adaptation. Note that even if the results of adaptation are certain, the uncertainty in damages from mitigation will remain in the face of adaptation; adaptation cannot eliminate uncertainty in future outcomes, although it may reduce it.
> 2.2 Adaptation and the reduction of climate change damages
> Climate change adaptation can be reactive (alternating crops planted in response to changing weather patterns, moving people away from flooded coastlines, or renourishing beaches) or anticipatory (building seawalls, designing early warning systems, or developing new drought-resistant strains of crops). In an alternative construct with similar categories, adaptation can be divided into autonomous and policy-driven versions. The former may tend to happen on its own via market mechanisms while the latter will only happen with collective engagement and investment in the public sphere – it is policy-driven (IPCC, 2001; Schneider and Kuntz-Duriseti, 2002). Because of the self-interest motive, differences in private and public adaptation will affect project efficiency (Mendelsohn, 2000). Autonomous adaptation is what humans have always done without any outside prompting, maximise their own utility based on perceived conditions while subject to constraints. Policy-driven adaptation is a possibility only when functioning governments exist with the capacity to both tax people for collective good provision and formulate policy decisions based on credible estimates of future conditions. The two adaptation types will be influenced by environmental conditions, both as perceived in the present and as expected in the future.

> 1 a chronically higher global mean atmospheric temperature
> 2 both a larger variance in weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events
> 3 a higher probability of catastrophic and/or irreversible events.
> It is important to distinguish between climate damages to which we can adapt (and reduce their effects) and those to which we cannot (and which must be borne). For the first type, increasing a water reservoir’s capacity clearly reduces the risk of flooding damages, and such a project can be analysed within a cost-benefit framework. As to the second type, the unpleasantness of a hot summer day can be alleviated through the adaptive move of going inside and turning on air conditioning. But while outside there is little one can do and the unpleasant heat must be tolerated, which represents a utility loss that cannot be avoided. Definitional rigor is thus necessary when looking at climate change in a cost benefit framework. As Figure 2 shows, gross climate damages can be split into adaptable and non-adaptable damages, with adaptation levels chosen to address damages in the former category. The remaining damages to which we choose to adapt are the net or residual damages.

>  Current estimates of climate change damages and impacts are highly uncertain. Referring to the revised production function for the 2007 version of DICE, which includes estimates of damage costs and abatement costs, Nordhaus (2007) mentions that “It is clear that [the] equation is extremely conjectural given the weak base of empirical studies on which it rests.” Nevertheless, efforts continue on narrowing down the range of damage uncertainty. For example, Tol (2005b), in a meta-analysis of 103 estimates of the marginal damage costs of CO2 emissions, found that such costs are unlikely to exceed $50/tC – and are probably much smaller. The study builds upon a large body of previous and ongoing work on climate change damage functions and assessment of impacts in the presence of adaptation activities (IPCC, 2007b; Tol, 2002a–b; 1995; Yohe and Schlesinger, 1998).
> 
> The optimal paths of climate change mitigation and adaptation 71
> Previous work on adaptation describes the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of adaptation investments, often in a sector- or location-specific approach. For example, Mendelsohn (2000) shows that an optimal, damage-reducing level of adaptation can exist. Fankhauser et al. (1999) look at this optimal adaptation level, characterising repeated and periodic investments in adaptation as the replacement of existing capital stock. They conceive of an optimal capital turnover rate that is analogous to formulations of an optimal forest rotation rate. Early adaptation is postulated to be relevant for investments with long lead-times and durability, and where subsequent retrofitting would be expensive. And a no-regrets policy exists in enhancing the flexibility and ‘climate robustness’ of long-term, quasi-irreversible investments. Hope et al. (1993) applied their PAGE model to incorporate adaptation as a policy variable for all sectors of the economy, and found very high benefits from adaptation. But their estimates of benefits and costs have come under criticism as being unrealistic (de Bruin et al., 2009), and a later version of PAGE uses the same adaptation cost and benefit parameters (Hope, 2006). Other adaptation research has looked at the international equity implications of adaptation policy (Adger et al., 2006) as well as mitigation and adaptation from a game theoretic standpoint (Settle et al., 2007).
> As with mitigation, adaptation investments targeted to the same climate damage will need to be repeated over time. One option is to periodically invest a certain amount into protection, now and into the infinite future. Another option is to abandon the asset at the outset, taking an initial large loss but avoiding all future adaptation costs. A final option falls in between: spend regularly on adaptation for several investment periods until either the capital asset has depreciated below a value worth saving or protection costs have risen above the asset’s value, and then abandon it. The chosen discount rate and the value of the capital stock at risk will be key factors in these investment decisions.
> 2.3 Thinking about mitigation and adaptation together
> A simple understanding of the two primary climate policy responses characterises mitigation as damage prevention and adaptation as damage control, yet the differences are more nuanced. Varying timescales, co-benefits, and institutional scales – as well as the fact that mitigation is a public good while adaptation is a private or club good – will affect the relationship between the two policies in simultaneous implementation. Finally, adaptation is anthropocentric. Except in peripheral cases, adaptation funds will be geared toward improving human welfare alone. Successful mitigation programmes, alternatively, benefit both humans and the natural world. While humans can and will adapt to climate change, much of the natural world cannot (unless assisted by humans (Zimmer, 2007)), primarily because of the unprecedented speed at which the temperature is expected to rise. Cost and benefit analysis with human welfare maximisation provides a strong intellectual handle for the economist to grab, and it is the reason why environmental advocates emphasise mitigation, which affects both human welfare and the environment.
> Several authors have questioned the very notion of a ‘mitigation versus adaptation’ optimisation construct, arguing that an artificial separation of the two options may be potentially misleading (Michaelowa, 2001), that nations may have different, multiple, or nonexistent optima for each strategy (Klein et al., 2003), and that characterising the climate policy question in this way may have equity implications (Schneider and Lane, 2006).
> 
> 72 T. Felgenhauer and K.C. de Bruin
> Another approach allows that mitigation and adaptation could be optimised, but questions if they should be optimised simultaneously. Tol (2005a) argues that because of mismatches between the two policy options in scale, clients, and time scales, mitigation and most forms of adaptation should be kept separate in policy analyses. Instead, only what he calls ‘facilitative adaptation’ should be included with mitigation in an optimisation. As described, facilitative adaptation is a small sub-set of policy-driven and anticipatory adaptation where the national government intervenes less in order to allow economic actors to adapt better. Tol writes that “Facilitative adaptation is about making society more robust and more flexible – and even if there were no climate change, societies have to be robust and flexible to withstand other changes, many of which are more rapid than global warming.” Thus, Tol’s facilitative adaptation is a subset of what Smit et al. (2001) call “adaptive capacity” building, which usually takes the form of advocacy for integrating adaptive measures into sustainable development (IPCC, 2007b; Stern, 2006a). In order to promote adaptation in the developing world, the call has been to promote economic development in general, and hence build adaptive capacity. A different but related point has been made by other authors (Goklany, 2005; Lomborg, 2006; Pielke and Sarewitz, 2005) who argue that climate change by itself is unlikely to be the biggest source of damages and welfare loss in this century. We should therefore attach primacy to attacking the bigger threats to global welfare – e.g., malaria, AIDS, and clean water provision – and we should address these threats directly, instead of via climate policy.
> Finally, it could be argued that mitigation and adaptation have different policy goals. For example, some may find it desirable to first optimise our mitigation efforts in order that global temperatures remain below a particular ‘dangerous’ ceiling – and then, once mitigation is set, adapt in the short term to climate impacts as needs become apparent. In this storyline, optimal adaptation depends upon normatively-determined (i.e., non-optimal) mitigation levels, but not vice versa. As in Figure 1, sequencing is again implied: First mitigate as much as desired, and then see how much adaptation is needed. This scenario is explored further in the results section of this paper.
> Despite the differences in the two approaches, however, we argue here that because mitigation and adaptation both act on a fundamental level to reduce the human risk exposure to climate change they can be optimised simultaneously. Under constrained budgets policymakers will face decisions on investing resources in mitigation, adaptation, or both; will want to know the optimal mix of the two strategies; and will choose from among a portfolio of the two in order to reduce the expected endogenous risks of climate change (Kane and Shogren, 2000; Pielke, 1998; Yohe, 2005). Cox and Stephenson (2007) argue that although adaptation and mitigation “may at first sight appear to require different modeling strategies” the gap in the different timescales of each strategy could be closed so that an overall policy is optimised on a 30–50 year time period while accounting for uncertainty.
> 2.4 Modelling the mitigate-adapt portfolio choice
> Some previous efforts have modelled the mitigate-adapt portfolio choice under certainty but, to our knowledge, none have yet incorporated uncertainty into the analysis. Fankhauser (1996) postulates a simple global model of tradeoffs between mitigation and adaptation that minimises human welfare losses due to climate change:
> 
> The optimal paths of climate change mitigation and adaptation 73 min MC(m) + PC(a) + RD(m, a). (1)
> A global policymaker chooses levels of mitigation m and adaptation a that minimise the sum of the three costs of mitigation MC, adaptation PC, and residual damages RD. Total mitigation and adaptation costs rise with an increased use of either strategy, while damage costs fall with both. Fankhauser (1996) notes that adaptation costs could also be of the form PC(a, m), as future adaptation levels will depend on present day mitigation efforts. Considered separately, optimal mitigation occurs when ∂MC(m)/∂m = –∂RD/∂m, and optimal adaptation when ∂PC(a)/∂a = –∂RD/∂a. The remainder of his analysis treats adaptation decisions independently of mitigation decisions.
> Optimal adaptation is cost effective. Tol (2004) employs scenario analysis with a simulation model to examine mitigation and adaptation strategies in the standard ‘doubled CO2 by 2100’ scenario. Applying the FUND model, and measuring over the attributes of dryland and wetland loss, protection costs, and forced migration, Tol (2004) finds that adaptation in these sectors shrinks economic damages by a factor of 10–100, while mitigation only reduces damages by at most 10%. If this result were to apply to mitigation and adaptation more broadly it is a profound outcome that would require a complete rethinking of present policy approaches to climate change. As expected, he also finds that if the level of mitigation is higher then less adaptation is needed. And adaptation has a minor cost compared to the damages avoided.
> Kane and Shogren (2000) approach the issue of tradeoffs between mitigation and adaptation using an endogenous risk framework, meaning that society can choose its level of risk avoidance via a mix of mitigation and adaptation policies. Under an international environmental regime such as the Kyoto Protocol, climate change policy decisions are∫framed at the national level. The nation’s maximisation problem is:
> max⎡ w(m−D(z;x)−c(x,s))dF(z;S,α)⎤, (2) ⎢b ⎥
> x,s ⎣a ⎦
> where the nation chooses adaptation and mitigation levels to maximise net wealth (welfare) w, over an arbitrary time period. Wealth is determined by national income m minus both 1) climate change damages D, which depend on the unknown state of the climate system z and adaptation investments x, as well as 2) the costs, c, of both national adaptation and mitigation (s) investments. The decision on how much to mitigate and adapt is then tempered by a cumulative probability distribution of the unknown state of the climate system z, world mitigation effort S, and an index of ambient riskiness α. The difference between z and α is subtle: z is our best knowledge about whether climate change is brutal (high z) or benign (low z), while α is an index of the odds that the climate changes will be severe or mild (increasing α increases the odds that a more brutal climate outcome will be realised). The authors find that more risk can either increase or decrease the marginal effectiveness of mitigation, which leads to increased or decreased mitigation, respectively. If increased risk does not decrease the marginal productivity of adaptation, then more adaptation results; otherwise the outcome on adaptation is ambiguous.
> Finally, Ingham et al. (2005a) utilise a simplified version of the Kane and Shogren (2000) model to make several basic conclusions about mitigation and adaptation, and show how they are usually substitutes. The social planner’s problem is to choose a

> C(m, a | δ,α) ≡ δD(m, a) + M(m) + αA(a). (3) 3 Model description
> 3.1 Incorporating adaptation within DICE: AD-DICE
> The Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) model (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000) was originally developed by Nordhaus (1994). It is a global integrated assessment model and includes economic growth functions as well as geophysical functions. In this model, utility, calculated as the discounted natural logarithm of consumption, is maximised. In each time period, consumption and savings/investment are endogenously chosen subject to available income reduced by the costs of climate change (residual damages, mitigation costs and adaptation costs). The climate change damages are represented by a damage function that depends on the temperature increase compared to 1900 levels. Mitigation is represented on a [0–1] scale, representing the fraction of GHG emissions which are abated relative to the baseline emissions for that period. The mitigation cost function declines over time, but the benefits of the policy are lagged far into the future due to the slow working of the carbon cycle.
> DICE includes adaptation implicitly as part of the damage function (Cline, 2006). This formulation ignores the explicit mechanism that adaptation reduces damages but assumes a damage function where adaptation has already taken place in an optimal way. However, the DICE modelling framework does allow for the inclusion of an adaptation policy response, and de Bruin et al. (2009) achieve this in their AD-DICE model through the straightforward incorporation of a policy variable of ‘protection’ in the climate damage function.
> In their setting gross damages are defined as the initial damages by climate change if no changes were to be made in ecological, social and economic systems. If these systems were to change to limit climate change damages (i.e., adapt) the damages would decrease. These ‘left-over’ damages are referred to here as residual damages. Reducing gross damages, however, comes at a cost, i.e., the investment of resources in adaptation. These costs are referred to as adaptation costs.
> In the DICE model the net damage function is a combination of the optimal mix of adaptation costs and residual damages. Thus the net damage function given in DICE can be unravelled into residual damages and adaptation costs. The original DICE-99 damage function (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000) is continuous, with damages rising exponentially with the temperature rise:
> D(t) = θ1T(t) + θ2T(t)2. (4) In AD-DICE this is expanded by distinguishing between residual damages and adaptation
> (protection) costs, as given in Equation (5).
> D(t) = RD(t) + PC(t). (5)
> Furthermore gross damages are defined in accordance with the functional form most often used in the literature, as follows:
> 
> The optimal paths of climate change mitigation and adaptation 75 GD(t)=αT(t)+αT(t)α3 , (6)
> 12
> Equation (7), which shows residual damages. Like mitigation, adaptation is also on a [0–1] scale where zero represents no adaptation and one represents hypothetical full adaptation and elimination of all gross damages in that time period:
> RD(t) = GD(t) * (1 – P(t)). (7) Finally the costs of adaptation are given as follows:
> PC(t)=φP(t)φ2 . (8) 1
> The setup matches the diagram presented earlier in Figure 1. In the model the benefits of adaptation are felt immediately – gross climate damages occur and then adaptation reduces them to a lower level of net damages. In DICE net damages are given as a fraction of output; here residual damages, protection costs, and gross damages are also given as a fraction of output. The model is then calibrated in de Bruin et al. (2009) to replicate the original DICE damage function when optimal adaptation is assumed, as is assumed in the original damage function.
> Using AD-DICE, de Bruin et al. (2009) confirmed the results of Ingham et al. (2005a) that an optimal response to climate change will contain a mix of both mitigation and adaptation. They also showed that:

> Incorporating uncertainty
> Climate change is an uncertain and multi-generational problem, and policies will necessarily need to be made in the presence of this uncertainty. The importance of uncertainty is now officially acknowledged, as the latest IPCC (2007a) assessment puts explicit uncertainty bounds on most predictions. New information about the sensitivity of the climate system, mitigation costs and benefits, adaptation costs and benefits, and the overall effectiveness of climate policies will lead policymakers to reassess their previous choices and revise them for the next period. By definition, all mitigation is anticipatory of expected but uncertain damages. And while most reactive, emergency, or autonomous adaptation will occur when the damages are relatively apparent and certain, anticipatory and policy-driven adaptation will have to occur before these uncertainties are erased. Decision making under uncertainty is thus an appropriate tool to address climate change, as uncertainties will approach resolution only gradually and over relatively long time periods and some amount of uncertainty will never be resolved (Webster et al., 2003). Such a situation matches a Bayesian analysis framework, where prior information is updated and revised with new data, and subsequent decisions are based on the new
> 
> 76 T. Felgenhauer and K.C. de Bruin
> assumptions (Winkler, 2003). Because the policy question is one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, we only need to decide what to do today; future decisions can be revised as we learn more (Webster et al., 2007).
> As noted, none of the previous analyses of mitigation and adaptation tradeoffs have incorporated uncertainty. Part II of this research incorporated a two-stage decision under uncertainty, with learning, into our version of the AD-DICE model. In the simplest form, such a model may be employed as in Figure 3. It depicts a two-period decision tree where a policy emphasis is chosen, an uncertain and probabilistic climate outcome occurs, and then a second decision is made with resulting final returns or losses. The dates and climate outcomes shown do not match those used in our uncertainty model runs, but instead illustrate the mechanics of such a model. This method has been applied often to the climate change problem (Webster, 2002; Webster et al., 2007; Yohe et al., 2004).

> 4.1 Mitigation and adaptation under certainty
> Using our own version of the certain AD-DICE model, we replicate some of the key results achieved by de Bruin et al. (2009), as well as look at the implications for a temperature target policy. From Figures 4–5, we observe first, that mitigation and adaptation are policy substitutes. Both policies reduce human risk exposure to climate change and in this model can be interchanged and adjusted each period to achieve that goal. Adding one strategy as a response to climate change lowers the optimal level of the other strategy already employed. Second, adding adaptation to a mitigation-only approach (Figure 4) lowers optimal mitigation levels much more than adding mitigation to an adaptation-only approach (Figure 5) lowers optimal adaptation levels.

As Figure 6 illustrates, temperatures in a fully-implemented adaptation-only scenario rise exactly as in the business as usual (no policy) case. Even though humans are able to respond to climate change and eliminate many of the related damages, the natural world continues to suffer harm. Further, although humans will be able to adapt, there is little that humans can do on a meaningful scale to help vulnerable ecosystems adapt to a rapidly changing climate (Zimmer, 2007). In focusing exclusively on the option of human adaptation (which may turn out to be much cheaper than mitigation (Tol, 2004)) we ignore our non-market preference valuation for the protection of nature. Further research on measures of willingness to pay for environmental protection, as well as the value of ecosystem services, could place more relative weight on mitigation policies versus adaptation in calculations of total welfare change.
> Figure 6 Atmospheric temperature under four mitigation and adaptation scenarios (see online version for colours)
> Relatedly, because including adaptation allows lower optimal mitigation levels, gross climate damages will rise. However, as Figure 7 shows, the total costs born by humans will fall as adaptation will lower these new higher gross damages to a level of net damages that is lower than under a mitigation-only approach. The model results of Figure 7 again reflect the relationship between gross and net damages presented earlier in Figure 2.
> Figure 8 shows the total policy cost of four example climate policies that would be implemented over 1995–2185, where each bar represents a decade. The cost-benefit calculation is straightforward: Mitigation has a cost, which is balanced by the benefit of reduced long-term climate damages, and adaptation has a cost as well, which is balanced by the benefit of reduced short-term damages. ‘Net damages’ thus reflects the implementation of both mitigation and adaptation. Clearly, the do-nothing or ‘business as usual’ policy is the most costly, showing that climate policy in the form of either mitigation or adaptation, or both, is beneficial. An adaptation-only approach reduces

> total costs more than does a mitigation-only approach, and joint implementation of the two strategies reduces costs even more. Furthermore, in all four of the policy scenarios both the costs of mitigation and adaptation are minimal when compared to the total climate damages.

> The result that adding optimal-level adaptation to a pre-existing mitigation policy lowers total costs is also robust to non-optimal mitigation scenarios as well. Figure 9 displays the total policy costs of three non-optimal mitigation policies, both with and without the inclusion of optimal adaptation. As described previously, an assumption in this set of scenarios is that mitigation is not set optimally but instead to achieve a particular temperature goal, say 2oC, 3oC, or 4oC. We first look at the ‘mitigation only’ runs. As seen on the far left, the share of mitigation costs in the total costs is particularly high for the 2-degree temperature target, but falls sharply as less stringent targets are set (3- and 4-degree), and climate damages dominate the total costs.

With all three temperature target policies, the addition of optimised adaptation lowers total costs by reducing climate damages more than the cost of the added adaptation. Thus, even with a non-optimal temperature goal for mitigation, the addition of adaptation is the most cost effective way of achieving that goal.
> 4.2 Mitigation and adaptation under uncertainty
> For the uncertain model runs we generated the probability distribution of five Climate Sensitivity (CS) values shown in Figure 10, with an expected value of CS equal to that of the certain scenarios, where CS = 2.9078 (taken from Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000). Each of the five CS values is thus associated with a different state of the world. The full set of

> mitigation and adaptation paths is shown in Figure 11, for both certain and uncertain cases. In time period one, t1 (1995) there is zero knowledge of climate change and thus no climate policy. At t2 (2005) some scientific learning has occurred that generates an uncertain discrete distribution of five expected CS values in the future. Using the expected value of the PDF, the optimising policymaker then chooses optimal paths for both mitigation and adaptation and continues these policies through t3 (2015). At t4 (2025) full scientific learning occurs, and the policymaker now knows the true CS. With full certainty, new optimal mitigation and adaptation paths are chosen and are unaltered for all remaining time periods in the model run.

>                           The key result is that, in the pre-learning period, uncertainty in future CS leads to a lower emphasis on both mitigation and adaptation as compared to the certain case. In the absence of uncertainty, today’s efficient mitigation and adaptation levels would be determined by what is needed to meet the long run target, whether that goal is an actual temperature target or an optimised level. In this instance we optimise to maximise the net discounted utility, as in DICE. Then, following Webster et al. (2007), under uncertainty the level of reductions today should hedge against the occurrence of uncertain but possible states of the world.
> The sensitivity of optimal mitigation and adaptation levels was then tested for 25% changes in mitigation costs, gross climate damages, and adaptation costs, under both certainty and uncertainty, with the results shown in Figures 12–13. The sensitivity analysis showed that, for both mitigation and adaptation, the cost of each respective strategy is the main driver affecting the chosen level of that strategy, with higher costs lowering optimal levels. Moreover, mitigation levels vary minimally with adaptation costs and adaptation levels vary even less with changing mitigation costs (and they are invariant in the uncertain case).

>      It is apparent that mitigation and adaptation choices under uncertainty are sensitive to changes in CS. First, in moving from a 2.9078 to a 4.0 CS, optimal mitigation and optimal adaptation both rise, for both the certain and uncertain cases. A higher CS is correlated with higher damages. As both the mitigation and adaptation strategies are policy substitutes – each working to reduce climate damages – a scenario with higher climate damages requires higher levels of both responses.
> Second, with a rising CS, certain and uncertain optimal mitigation rises much more than does certain and uncertain optimal adaptation. This result is probably due to the fact that CS is a parameter with long-run implications; changes in CS change outcomes in short-run, the long-run strategy will be affected more by a parameter that changes the far future. This parallels the conclusions made in Cox and Stephenson (2007), who find that with mitigation “the dominant uncertainties are associated with climate system processes and feedbacks, rather than uncertainties in initial conditions”. One way to test this hypothesis would be to vary climate damages instead of CS. In the AD-DICE framework, in both the certain and uncertain versions, damages are a short-run phenomenon that are
> 
> The optimal paths of climate change mitigation and adaptation 85
> addressed in that time period by immediate adaptation. By this hypothesis we would expect an increase in climate change damages to affect adaptation levels more than mitigation levels, which is the opposite of what occurs when CS is varied.
> Finally, for both optimal mitigation and optimal adaptation, under rising CS, policy levels in the uncertain case close the gap (the percent difference between the two levels) to approach the policy levels under certainty. Under uncertainty, the decision maker hedges against costly overinvestment in mitigation and adaptation technologies. When the severity of the expected climate change is higher, however, this hedging effect falls as the expected costs of overinvestment decrease. It may be that increasing the CS even further would eventually eliminate the hedging, though this initial hypothesis needs to be tested.
> 5 Conclusions
> This paper explores the mitigate-adapt choice under conditions of certainty as well as the more realistic situation of uncertainty. Fankhauser (1996) mentions that “In the global context, the challenge is to find the mix of adaptation and mitigation projects that would best serve an agreed-upon set of global objectives.” We begin the process of tackling this challenge here.
> Several conclusions can be drawn from the model simulations conducted in this study. Adaptation is necessary for an efficient climate policy response with the lowest costs and highest overall welfare. This is true whether the goal is an overall optimisation with maximised net utility, or a particular global mean atmospheric temperature target. The global warming commitment means that optimal adaptation will likely reduce costs even if the hypothetical highest possible mitigation strategy were implemented immediately. Indeed, as noted, adaptation, unlike mitigation, is the only response capable of reducing climate change damages over the next several decades. Finally, modelling uncertainty over different and uncertain values of climate sensitivity – a more accurate portrayal of the real world – significantly changes optimal policy decisions that are instead modelled under assumptions of certainty.
> Multiple directions to extend this research can be seen. Varying the extent of climate damages, mitigation costs, and adaptation costs – all under both certainty and uncertainty – would be useful explorations. Much work also remains to be done in varying the extent and time period of learning, as well as incorporating a non-linear damage function that captures catastrophic and/or irreversible climate change damages.
