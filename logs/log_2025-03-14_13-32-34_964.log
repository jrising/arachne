> I want to write a story on the premise that there was a Wiccan coven-- probably inspired by interaction with native Americans-- that some of the women accused in the Salem Witch Trials were part of. Which accused witches would most likely have been actual Wiccans? And in particular, I want to tie things back to interactions in the 1650s or 1660s-- so, 30 years before the trials. The story would be about someone in the coven back then, who left, but helped educate some of the people who were actually accused. Can you identify some potential connections that way?

> This is a fascinating premise for a story, and there are some historical nuances and creative liberties you can explore. The actual historical account of the Salem Witch Trials does not provide evidence of a Wiccan coven, as Wicca, as it's recognized today, did not exist in that time. However, for storytelling, you can creatively weave elements of indigenous influence and mystical practices into your narrative.
> 
> While none of the accused witches of the Salem Witch Trials were known to be actual practitioners of Wicca, some of the women who were accused had reputations or backgrounds that might make them suitable candidates for your narrative. Consider these possible historical figures:
> 
> 1. **Tituba**: She was an enslaved woman of diverse heritage, often depicted with a background of African and Native American influence. She confessed to practicing witchcraft, possibly under coercion, and her knowledge of various practices could be connected to indigenous spiritual practices in your story.
> 
> 2. **Sarah Good**: A homeless woman considered an outcast in Salem society. Her marginalized position might lend itself to secretive spiritual or folk practices outside mainstream Puritan beliefs.
> 
> 3. **Sarah Osborne**: An elderly woman who was already a target of gossip due to her conflict with the local church. Her personal struggles might allow for a backstory involving nonconventional practices.
> 
> 4. **Martha Carrier**: She had a reputation for being a divisive and strong-willed woman, traits that might be twisted in your narrative to depict someone who challenges social and spiritual norms.
> 
> 5. **Bridget Bishop**: Frequently accused before the actual witch trials for various unseemly behaviors, she could represent a bridge between societal misunderstandings and actual mystical engagement.
> 
> For a connection back to the 1650s or 1660s, when interactions with Native Americans were more frequent due to frontier expansion, you could consider creating a fictional character who mingles with different communities. This character might learn spiritual practices or herbal knowledge from indigenous peoples, forming a kind of early "coven" or secret group that passed down this knowledge. Over time, this knowledge could be transmitted to the women above, linking them to a deeper, hidden spiritual lineage not acknowledged by history.
> 
> This storyline allows for a rich exploration of cultural interaction, personal transformation, and the complex intersection of gender, power, and spirituality in early America.
