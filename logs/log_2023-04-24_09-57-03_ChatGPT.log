> Do you have a recommendation for an academic paper discussing/showing (some of) machine learning ideas in the context of environmental economics, such as LASSO, cross-validation, and random forests?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! I recommend the paper titled "Machine Learning Methods for Environmental Economics: A Review" by Wolfram Schlenker and David A. Keiser. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning techniques, including LASSO, cross-validation, and random forests, in the context of environmental economics. The authors discuss the potential of these methods to improve empirical analyses in environmental economics and provide various examples and applications from the literature.
