**assistant**:
> Rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are expected to decrease the nutritional value of many crops. This includes both macronutrients and micronutrients, but the problem is particularly pronounced with regard to key nutrients including protein, iron, and zinc.
> 
> 1. **Proteins**: High levels of CO2 have been found to reduce the concentrations of protein in a range of major crops, including rice, wheat, and potatoes.
> 
> 2. **Micronutrients**: Experiments have shown decreased levels of important micronutrients like iron and zinc under high CO2 conditions, affecting largely consumed food crops like rice, wheat, barley, and soybeans.

> The exact mechanism behind this is not entirely understood, but it's thought that elevated CO2 levels may impact the plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the soil, or possibly dilute nutrients in the plant tissues. Other theories propose that higher CO2 levels could potentially alter the plant's natural processes or biochemistry in some way, leading to reduced nutrient content. The impacts are likely to vary between crop types and specific nutrients.
