> What is a capital S in the permissions text on Linux?
**assistant**:
> In the permissions text on Linux, a capital `S` can appear in the place where you would normally see an `s` indicating the "setuid" or "setgid" bit for a file or directory. When you see `S` instead of `s`, it means that the corresponding execute permission (`x`) is not set for that user or group.
> 
> Here's a brief explanation of setuid and setgid:
> 
> - **setuid**: Indicates that when the program is executed, it will run with the user ID of the file owner, rather than the user who runs it.
> - **setgid**: Indicates that when the program is executed, it will run with the group ID of the file owner instead of the group of the user who runs it.
> 
> In the permission string, the capital `S` can appear in the following positions:
> 
> - In the fourth position, it represents the setuid bit without execute permission for the file owner: `-S---x---` or `-S---x--x`.
> - In the seventh position, it represents the setgid bit without execute permission for the group owner: `---S-----` or `----Sx---`.
> 
> For example, if you see `-r-Sr--r--`, it means that the file has read-only permission for the owner, the setuid bit is set, and the group and others have read-only permission, but no execute permissions are set for the owner and group.
