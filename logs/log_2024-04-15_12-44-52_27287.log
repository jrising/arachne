> I've heard there's a trick to making hard boiled eggs so they peal easily. How do I do it?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there are a few tips and tricks that can make peeling hard-boiled eggs easier:
> 
> 1. **Use older eggs**: Fresh eggs are harder to peel than older ones. If you have a choice, use eggs that are about a week old.
> 
> 2. **Boil properly**: Start by placing the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan. Add enough water to cover the eggs by about an inch or two. Heat the saucepan on high until the water begins to boil, then turn down the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and let the eggs simmer for about 9-12 minutes.
> 
> 3. **Ice bath**: After boiling, immediately transfer the eggs into an ice bath (a bowl filled with ice and water). This stops the cooking process and makes the eggs contract slightly in the shell, which helps in peeling.
> 
> 4. **Crack and roll**: After the eggs have cooled, gently tap each egg on a hard surface to crack the shell, then roll the egg between your hands to loosen the shell.
> 
> 5. **Peel under running water**: Peel the eggs under a bit of running water to help remove any small bits of shell that might be sticking to the egg.
> 
> Remember, practice makes perfect, and each batch of eggs can be a little different. With time, you'll find the exact method that works best for you.
