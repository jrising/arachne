**user**:
> I am making a series of related plots in ggplot2 that I want to line up exactly on consecutive slides. To do this, I want to ask ggplot2 to make the plot including all of the lines, but to basically not show some of the lines in either the graph or legend. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> One of the methods available to achieve your goal is to manipulate the 'alpha' aesthetic in ggplot2. In this context, 'alpha' refers to transparency, with 1 being fully opaque and 0 completely transparent. 
> 
> For example, consider a simple data frame with three different groups "a","b", and "c". Assume that you want to have three similar plots but only showing groups "a", "b", and "c" respectively in each plot. In reality, all three groups will be plotted in each plot but two of them will be hidden.
> 
> ```r
> # Load required library
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Create a sample data frame
> df <- data.frame(x = 1:30,
>                  y = rnorm(30),
>                  group = rep(c("a", "b", "c"), each = 10))
> 
> # Create a function for the plots
> hidden_plot <- function(df, displayed) {
>   ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group, 
>                  alpha = ifelse(group %in% displayed, 1, 0))) +
>     geom_line() +
>     scale_alpha_continuous(range = c(0, 1), guide = 'none') +
>     labs(color = 'group') +
>     theme_minimal()
> }
> 
> ```
> You can now use this function to create the plots with only the desired group displayed:
> 
> ```r
> hidden_plot(df, "a") # Only group "a" will be visible
> hidden_plot(df, "b") # Only group "b" will be visible
> hidden_plot(df, "c") # Only group "c" will be visible
> ```
> 
> However, the above plots will still leave a space in the legend for the non-visible groups, because they are actually in the plot, but just hidden! If you want the legend to only show the visible data group, you'll have to do some additional manipulation:
> 
> ```r
> visible_plot <- function(df, displayed) {
>   df <- subset(df, group %in% displayed)
>   
>   ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
>     geom_line() +
>     labs(color = 'group') +
>     theme_minimal()
> }
> 
> visible_plot(df, "a") # Only group "a" will be shown in plot and legend
> visible_plot(df, "b") # Only group "b" will be shown in plot and legend
> visible_plot(df, "c") # Only group "c" will be shown in plot and legend
> ```
> 
> Here, `visible_plot` takes a subset of the original data frame, keeping only the displayed group. As a result, ggplot only creates a legend for the visible group. This should resolve the spacing issue in the legend. Please note, with this method, even the hidden lines are completely removed from the plot.
