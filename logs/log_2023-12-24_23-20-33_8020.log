**user**:
> I am updating an old version of mediawiki. On the database update, I get the error "/Database.php: Error 1146: Table 'openworld_existencia_org.categorylinks' doesn't exist
> Function: DatabaseUpdater::doCollationUpdate". How can I fix this?
**assistant**:
> The error is saying that the `categorylinks` table doesn't exist in your `openworld_existencia_org` database. This can happen when updating an older version of MediaWiki if one or more of the required tables were not created during the setup or got deleted somehow.
> 
> Here is what you can do to fix the error:
> 
> 1.  First, check if the table really doesn't exist. You can do this by logging into your MySQL database using a client, like phpMyAdmin, and navigating to the `openworld_existencia_org` database. Once there, inspect the list of tables to see if `categorylinks` is present. 
> 
> 2.  If the table doesnâ€™t exist, you would need to create it manually. The SQL command to create the table is stored in the MediaWiki's installation `.sql` file. 
> 
> For MediaWiki 1.37, you can find the file in the root directory of your MediaWiki installation, in the folder `\maintenance\tables.sql`. Open this file up and look for a CREATE TABLE statement for the `categorylinks` table. The SQL statement should look something like this:
> 
>     ```sql
>     CREATE TABLE /*_*/categorylinks (
>       cl_from int unsigned NOT NULL default 0,
>       cl_to varchar(255) binary NOT NULL default '',
>       cl_sortkey_prefix varchar(255) binary NOT NULL default '',
>       cl_sortkey varbinary(230) NOT NULL default '',
>       cl_collation varbinary(32) NOT NULL default '',
>       cl_type varbinary(32) NOT NULL default 'page',
>       cl_timestamp timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
>       PRIMARY KEY cl_from(cl_from,cl_to),
>       KEY cl_sortkey(cl_to,cl_type,cl_sortkey,cl_from),
>       KEY cl_timestamp(cl_to,cl_timestamp)
>     ) /*$wgDBTableOptions*/;
>     ```
> 
>     Please adjust this SQL statement according to your SQL file in your version.
> 
> 3. Open your MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin), select your database `openworld_existencia_org`, and execute the SQL statement. 
> 
> 4. After you have created the table, you can rerun the database update script.
> 
> Please note that it's strongly recommended to back up your database before making any changes to it. This way, in case something goes wrong, you can restore your database to its previous state. 
> 
> If you continue to have issues, don't hesitate to reach out.
