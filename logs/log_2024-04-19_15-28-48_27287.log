> Is there an opposite to pandas's isin? I want to check if a value is in a column.
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is an opposite to the `isin()` function in pandas. If you are looking to check if a value is *not* in a column, you should use the `~` operator create the opposite of the Boolean Series that `isin()` returns. 
> 
> For example, suppose you have a DataFrame `df` with a column 'A', and you want to filter rows where the value of 'A' is not in the list `[1, 2, 3]`. You would do it like this:
> 
> ```python
> df[~df['A'].isin([1, 2, 3])]
> ```
> 
> This code returns a DataFrame that only includes rows where the 'A' value is not 1, 2, or 3. The `~` operator is key here. It effectively "inverts" the true/false values that `isin()` returns.
**user**:
> Sorry, I meant: How can I test to see if a value is in a column?
**assistant**:
> No problem! To test if a specific value is present in a column in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `in` operator combined with the column you want to check. Here's an example:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # Create a sample DataFrame
> data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
>         'B': ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'pear', 'kiwi']}
> df = pd.DataFrame(data)
> 
> # Check if a value is in a specific column
> value_to_check = 3
> is_value_in_column = value_to_check in df['A'].values
> 
> print(is_value_in_column)
> ```
> 
> In this example, we create a DataFrame with columns 'A' and 'B'. We then check if the value `3` is present in column 'A'. The variable `is_value_in_column` will be `True` if the value is present and `False` if it is not.
