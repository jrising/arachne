> My co-author has written that some result comes from "the method deployed here". But that seems like an odd use of the word "deployed". Should it be "employed" or "applied" instead?
**assistant**:
> The term "deployed" is commonly used in a military or strategic context. It suggests that a plan or method has been strategically implemented in a scenario. In academic or tech writing, "deployed" can sometimes refer to the utilization of an algorithm, system, or model.
> 
> Nonetheless, the term may seem a bit too strong or ill-suited depending on the context in your co-author's sentence. 
> 
> Both "employed" and "applied" are definitely acceptable substitutions. "Employed" suggests that a specific method was used or utilized, while "applied" indicates that it was put into action or practice to a particular situation. Both words usually work well in the context of research methodology.
> 
> If the method was more than just used—if it was specifically chosen and thoughtfully put into action—then "deployed" might be appropriate. If it was just used in the course of the research, then "applied" or "employed" might be more accurate.
> 
> Ultimately, the choice between "deployed", "employed", or "applied" depends on the extent of strategic intent and fittingness you are trying to convey behind the utilization of the method.
