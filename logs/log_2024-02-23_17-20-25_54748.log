**user**:
> One of my colleagues is proposing to share the following data: "Scientific trawl surveys  data, CTD data for Senegal ZEE over last 30 years.  Historical and projected (to 2050) status of fish stocks.". What is CTD and ZEE?
**assistant**:
> In the context of marine and fisheries research:
> 
> - CTD refers to "Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth". A CTD device is used to provide detailed profile and data of the physical characteristics of the sea. It is often deployed during trawl surveys and provides important environmental context for marine life.
> 
> - ZEE stands for "Zone Economique Exclusive" in French, or "Exclusive Economic Zone" (EEZ) in English. It is a sea zone over which a state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources. For Senegal, its EEZ extends 200 nautical miles from its coast, as designated by international law.
> 
> So, your colleague proposes sharing data from scientific trawl surveys and CTD measurements conducted in Senegal's EEZ over the last 30 years, along with historical and projected data about fish stocks till 2050. These data could be instrumental in evaluating the health of marine ecosystems, making conservation plans and managing fisheries sustainably.
