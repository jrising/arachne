> In the sentence: "Please see the idea below and let me know if you have ideas for who to approach." Should I actually say, "for whom"?
**assistant**:
> Yes, "whom" would be the grammatically correct choice in that context. "Whom" is used when referring to the object of a verb or preposition, and in this sentence, "whom" is the object of the preposition "for." So, the corrected sentence would read: "Please see the idea below and let me know if you have ideas for whom to approach." However, keep in mind that in informal contexts, many people use "who" instead of "whom," so using "who" might still be acceptable depending on your audience.
