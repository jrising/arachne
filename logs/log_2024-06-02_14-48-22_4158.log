> How can I delete a list of items from a sqllite database in sqlalchemy? I have an ID column, but I actually have the full objects from a select call.
**assistant**:
> Deleting a list of items from a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy involves a few steps. Assuming you have a list of complete objects fetched from a previous query call, you can delete these objects individually or in a batch. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. **Individually delete each object:**
>    You can loop through each object in your list and delete them one by one.
> 
> 2. **Batch delete using IDs:**
>    Extract the IDs from your objects and perform a bulk deletion based on these IDs.
> 
> Here are examples of both methods:
> 
> ### Individual Deletion
> 
> ```python
> from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
> 
> # Replace 'sqlite:///your_database.db' with your actual database URL
> engine = create_engine('sqlite:///your_database.db')
> session = Session(engine)
> # Assuming 'MyTable' is your ORM-mapped class and 'objects_to_delete' is your list of objects
> objects_to_delete = session.query(MyTable).filter(MyTable.some_column == some_value).all()
> 
> for obj in objects_to_delete:
>     session.delete(obj)
> 
> session.commit()
> ```
> 
> ### Batch Deletion by IDs
> 
> If you prefer a bulk delete operation, you can extract the IDs and use them in a delete query:
> 
> ```python
> from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
> from sqlalchemy import create_engine, delete
> 
> # Replace 'sqlite:///your_database.db' with your actual database URL
> engine = create_engine('sqlite:///your_database.db')
> session = Session(engine)
> # Assuming 'MyTable' is your ORM-mapped class and 'objects_to_delete' is your list of objects
> objects_to_delete = session.query(MyTable).filter(MyTable.some_column == some_value).all()
> # Extracting IDs
> ids_to_delete = [obj.id for obj in objects_to_delete]
> 
> # Using the ORM delete function with a condition on IDs
> session.execute(delete(MyTable).where(MyTable.id.in_(ids_to_delete)))
> session.commit()
> ```
> 
> ### Notes:
> 1. Be cautious when performing bulk operations, as they bypass the ORM in significant ways.
> 2. Ensure you handle sessions correctly to avoid session leaks or unused session issues.
> 3. Make sure to import and use `delete` from `sqlalchemy` directly for batch deletions, as it provides a more performant way to handle large deletions.
> 
> Choose the method that fits your use case best.
