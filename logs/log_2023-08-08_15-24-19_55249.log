**assistant**:
> "Current dollars" and "Present dollars" are terms used in financial analyses that involve accounting for the effects of inflation over time.
> 
> "Current Dollars" refers to the value of a dollar in the specific year being considered. It represents the nominal or face value of money, unadjusted for inflation or deflation. When an analyst uses current dollars, they're using the cost of goods, services, wages, and other expenses in the prices that were applicable during that year.
> 
> "Present Dollars", also known as "Today's Dollars" or "Real Dollars," is a method of calculating the value of money in today's terms. It adjusts the value of a dollar for changes in purchasing power due to inflation or deflation. This method helps to compare the value of dollars across different time intervals in a way that accounts for the changing value of money.
> 
> Let's use an example: If you were comparing the price of gasoline from 1995 to 2023, you'd need to adjust the 1995 price by the rate of inflation to get a true comparison. If gas cost $1.15 in 1995, that might equate to $2.00 in "present dollars" in 2023, because the value of the dollar has decreased due to inflation over that 28-year span.
> 
> In essence, the key difference is that "current dollars" represent the face value of money at a given point in time, while "present dollars" are adjusted to account for inflation or deflation, making it possible to compare dollar values from different time periods.
