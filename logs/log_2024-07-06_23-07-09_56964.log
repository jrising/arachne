**assistant**:
> Yes, RSS feeds typically display entries in reverse chronological order, meaning the most recent entries appear first. This format is designed to ensure that users see the latest updates without having to scroll through older content. However, the ordering can sometimes be influenced by specific feed settings or how the feed reader processes the entries.
