**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon a report (Dewberry Engineers 2018) which has identified the following issues and data requirements for fisheries management:
> 
> Issues:
> • Understand fishing productivity
> • Understand active use areas, dense fishing
> areas, and type
> • Understand the economic importance of
> different fishing areas
> • Future cast commercial fishing trends
> • Develop fisheries management strategies
> • Manage protected species
> • Manage fishing quotas and allocation conflicts
> between commercial, recreational, and
> subsistence fisheries
> • Identify landing locations
> • Ensure proposed projects do not disturb
> fishing areas
> • Identify and engage fishing industry stakeholders
> 
> Data requirements
> • Jurisdictions and regulated areas
> • Abundance and distribution of marine species
> • Synthesized oceanographic parameters
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel
> Monitoring System (VMS)
> • Vessel Traffic – Automatic Identification
> Systems (AIS)
> • Human and cultural use areas
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel Trip
> Report (VTR)

**assistant**:
> Certainly, here's a pared-down summary in line with the data gaps relevant to Delaware's ocean and bay planning process.
> 
> Drawing from a report by Dewberry Engineers in 2018, several key issues and data requirements for fisheries management have been identified that aligns with Delaware's spatial planning efforts.
> 
> Central issues include the need to comprehend the productivity and economic value of different fishing areas. It's crucial to understand the future trends in commercial fishing in order to develop effective management strategies. There's an emphasis on the harmonious management of fishing quotas, ensuring that conflicts between commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries are mitigated. Ensuring that potential projects do not disrupt fishing areas is another vital point, along with the need to identify and engage fishing industry stakeholders.
> 
> In terms of data requirements, the report underscores the need for information on jurisdictions and regulated areas, the abundance, and distribution of marine species, vital oceanographic parameters, and detailed data about commercial fishing efforts. Additionally, the spatial characterization of human and cultural use areas, the variety of vessel traffic, as well as in-depth records of fishing areas through Vessel Trip Reports (VTRs) are stressed as well. Beyond that, among various environmental characteristics, species and habitat locations, especially benthic habitat, take prominence. Finally, the incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge is seen as an essential contributor to the planning process.
> 
> These aspects highlight potential data gaps that need to be filled to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of Delaware's ocean and bay areas, supporting efficient and effective spatial planning.
