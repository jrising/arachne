**user**:
> A grant call says "Budget Overview (1 page maximum): A basic budget outlining project costs is sufficient; detailed OCG budgets are not required." What is OCG?
**assistant**:
> OCG stands for the Office of Contracts and Grants, or sometimes Office of Sponsored Research. This is often the department within a university or similar institution that handles grant applications, contracts, and budgets for research or project funding. 
> 
> When the grant call states "detailed OCG budgets are not required," it means you don't need to provide an item-by-item, meticulous budget that would normally be reviewed or prepared in conjunction with your institution's OCG. In this case, only a basic budget outline of the project costs is required.
