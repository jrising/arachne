> In google sheets, I want to take the minimum over all values in a column, but I want to specify which column by a string contained in another cell. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by using a combination of the `INDIRECT` function and the `MIN` function in Google Sheets. The `INDIRECT` function allows you to construct a cell or range reference from a string.
> 
> Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. Assume the cell where you specify the column name (e.g., "B") is `A1`.
> 2. Use the following formula to get the minimum value of the specified column:
> 
> ```plaintext
> =MIN(INDIRECT(A1 & ":" & A1))
> ```
> 
> Explanation:
> - `A1` contains the column name, such as "B".
> - `A1 & ":" & A1` constructs a string representing the entire range of the column (e.g., "B:B").
> - `INDIRECT` converts that string into an actual range reference.
> - `MIN` finds the minimum value in that range.
> 
> ### Example
> 
> If `A1` contains `"B"`, then the formula `=MIN(INDIRECT(A1 & ":" & A1))` will evaluate to `=MIN(B:B)`, thus giving you the minimum value in column B.

**user**:
> Actually, I have the column label (so, A1 contains something like "Assignment 1 Grade", which is the first cell in that column).
**assistant**:
> Got it! In that case, if you have the column label in a cell (e.g., "Assignment 1 Grade" in cell `A1`), and you want to find the minimum value in the column named in that cell, you can use the following formula:
> 
> ```plaintext
> =MIN(INDIRECT(address(1, MATCH(A1, 1:1, 0)) & ":" & address(1048576, MATCH(A1, 1:1, 0)))
> ```
> 
> Here's how the formula works:
> 
> 1. The `MATCH` function is used to find the column number of the column with the label specified in cell `A1`. `MATCH(A1, 1:1, 0)` will return the column number where the label in `A1` is found.
> 2. The `ADDRESS` function is used to convert the row and column numbers into a cell reference. `ADDRESS(1, MATCH(A1, 1:1, 0))` will give the cell reference of the first cell in the column with the specified label.
> 3. The formula then constructs the range using `INDIRECT` by combining the cell reference of the first cell in the column (e.g., "Assignment 1 Grade") with the cell reference of the last cell in the column (`1048576` is the maximum number of rows in Google Sheets).
> 4. Finally, `MIN` function is used to find the minimum value in that constructed range.
> 
> This formula will dynamically find the minimum value in the column that matches the label in cell `A1`. Let me know if you need further assistance!
