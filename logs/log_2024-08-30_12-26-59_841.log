**assistant**:
> ## Action Items:
> 
> 1. **Remind people that we're not just BPS experts:** Use various communications channels to promote the diverse work that we do. Spread the word about our expertise in other areas as well.
>    
> 2. **Reinforce partnerships and find new alliances:** Continue building relationships, particularly with ACEE. Find best approaches to work with real estate groups. Also, explore other organizations, like SAJE, brought into picture due to individual connections, like Cliff's relationship with a state senator.
> 
> 3. **Strategize fundraising for Community Based Organization (CBO) partners:** Design a plan to help fundraise for CBO partners and navigate the potential impacts of federal money on their regions. Organize a meeting with funders to discuss the gaps and regional significance for codes.
>    
> 4. **Track oppositions to code progress:** Keep an eye on states like Missouri and Illinois where opposition to codes progress has been observed. Arrange for local regional energy affect organizations' involvement where necessary.
>    
> 5. **Maintain tabs on funding opportunities:** Stay informed about different funding opportunities via channels and newsletters such as DOE, ACEEE, REOs Midwest, and the likes. Use information sources like Google alert for 'energy codes', and participation in coalitions for this purpose.
>    
> 6. **Reorganize codes strategy:** In light of Amy's departure, evolve the codes strategy to better fit the fundraising side and embed within overall policy and regulatory work.
>    
> 7. **Plan for future work:** Outline next steps for strategy around small buildings, residual codes, and community centered work, bearing in mind community priorities. This might also involve drafting concept notes for residual codes and community work connections.
> 
> 8. **Establish improved financial strategy:** Develop a clear federal strategy about what to pursue rather than going after everything possible. Aim to understand what can be funded with state and local funding and what can't. Work toward integrating the fundraising goals with overall organizational growth plans and strategic plan.
> 
> 9. **Set realistic expectations:** One part of this could revolve around not pursuing funding below 25K. Ensure clarity about what can be delivered and by when. 
> 
> 10. **Develop a more unified, strategic approach:** Work toward everyone operating on a shared setup in the next few years. This includes staffing and strategic decisions and clear mapping of strategic plan elements against different areas.
> 
> 11. **Prepare for next meeting with Jessica, Amy, Rylyn:** Discuss the functioning of the Policy and Reg team, fundraising sentiments and the state of funds, and the possibility of turning the discussion points into a survey or form for internal information collection.
