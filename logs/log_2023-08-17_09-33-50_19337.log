> Setting up a regular laboratory for your students at the University of Delaware can be a powerful platform for collaborative learning, research progress, and professional development. Here are some key activities you may consider incorporating into your lab meetings:
> 
> 1. **Research Presentations:** Encourage each student to share their ongoing research progress periodically. This can include discussing their hypotheses, methodologies, findings, or any issues they're encountering. Other lab members can provide feedback or troubleshooting advice.
> 
> 2. **Journal Club:** Select relevant academic articles for the group to read and discuss. Rotate the responsibility of choosing and presenting among lab members. This practice enables everyone to stay current with the latest research, learn to critically evaluate papers, and practice public speaking.
> 
> 3. **Skill Workshops:** Organize short workshops to teach essential research skills. This can range from statistical analysis techniques, software tools, effective academic writing, ethical considerations, to experimental design.
> 
> 4. **Guest Lectures:** Invite experts from different fields related to your lab's research to give talks. This brings in fresh perspectives, spurs innovation, and allows students to network with scholars outside their immediate circle.
> 
> 5. **Grant Writing and critique sessions:** Provide guidance on writing good grant proposals. You could organize peer-review sessions where students critique each other's drafts.
> 
> 6. **Progress and Goal Setting Meetings:** Allocate time for students to talk about their progress towards their goals and to discuss any roadblocks they may be encountering.
> 
> 7. **Team Building Activities:** These can be as simple as icebreakers or as elaborate as lab outings or retreats. These activities can help to strengthen lab culture and enhance the working relationship among lab members.
> 
> 8. **Ethics Discussions:** Hold discussions about scientific integrity, responsible conduct of research, and ethical implications of the lab's work.
> 
> 9. **Well-being Check-ins:** Creating an environment that values mental health is key for a successful lab. Regularly check in with each member about their well-being, and remind them about university resources for support if needed.
> 
> 10. **Celebrations of Success:** Whether it's a paper acceptance, grant approval, or completion of a significant project milestone, make sure to celebrate big and small victories together to foster a sense of accomplishment and team spirit.
> 
> Remember, while it's important to keep meetings structured and productive, they should also be flexible enough to cater to the individual needs and concerns of every member. Make your lab meetings a safe and interactive space for everyone to learn and grow.
