**user**:
> When do you need to use "return" in javascript? Is the last statement always returned?
**assistant**:
> In JavaScript, the `return` statement ends function execution and returns a value to the caller function. It is necessary when you want to pass the result of an operation back to the place where the function was called.
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```javascript
> function add(a, b) {
>   return a + b;
> }
> 
> var result = add(1, 2); // result is now 3
> ```
> 
> In this example, the `return` statement sends the result of `a + b` back to where `add(1, 2)` was called, and the result is stored in the `result` variable.
> 
> If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it will return `undefined` by default when it is finished executing. Therefore, the last statement in a function is not always returned, unless it is followed by a `return` keyword. 
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```javascript
> function addWithoutReturn(a, b) {
>   let sum = a + b;
> }
> 
> console.log(addWithoutReturn(1, 2)); // undefined
> ```
> 
> In the `addWithoutReturn` function, `sum` is calculated but not returned, so when the function is called, the return value is `undefined`.
> 
> So, in JavaScript, you should use the `return` statement when you want a function to produce a result that can be used elsewhere in your code. If you don't need a result, you don't have to use `return`.
