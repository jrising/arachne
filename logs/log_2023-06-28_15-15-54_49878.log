> Below is a concept note for a grant proposal:
> ---
> This concept note outlines our proposed approach to the Belmont Forumâ€™s Climate, Environment, and Health II call, subject to further refinement in discussion with partners. Our research focuses on the implications of climate change on food production from the agricultural and fishing sectors, and subsequent consequences for health in vulnerable populations. We will take into account a specific portfolio of climate change factors that influence the relationships between exposure to environmental factors and outcomes for agriculture and fish productivity and human health. Climate and meteorological conditions can affect the productivity of sectors such as agriculture and fishery through both direct impacts on the biophysical production process and indirect effects on the environment. These two economic sectors, agriculture and fishing, are the most important sources of nutrition for human beings. 
> 
> In addition, climate variables and air pollution can influence physiology and human health endpoints, which can depend on, e.g., age and gender (demographic characteristics), health status, socio-economic conditions (including worker environments and labor conditions), adaptation policies, and the functioning of food and health systems.
> 
> 
> In our first area of investigation, we will focus on how climate change affects agriculture and fisheries production. Existing research suggests climate-driven losses to crucial agricultural production for staple crops across the developing world. While this is partially offset by increased CO2, crop nutrient contents are expected to diminish. Climate change is also expected to undermine marine ecosystems by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean such as temperatures, pH, oxygen content and salinity. These attributes can contribute to undesirable impacts on fish stock movements but also fish habitats including population shifts, fish density and demography,  increased mortality at different life-stages of the fishes, to finally affect fish population productivity and distribution.
> 
> We stress the significance of the ecosystem services in supporting food production. Agriculture depends on ecosystem processes that ensure soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification. Fisheries need thriving habitats and balanced food webs. Such ecosystem services are likely to be affected by climate change factors.
> When addressing the fishing sector, we will concentrate in countries of North-West Africa to identify biological and environmental conditions for habitats in this region of Africa taking into account the effects of climate change. We will use this local data to analyze the relationships between the environmental variables that are affected by climate change and fish habitat and biomass, and how such relationships could influence the sustainability of fish food for consumption to support healthy people. We will here consider not only country (in North-West Africa) differences, but also demographic, social and economic differences.
> 
> While existing research connects agricultural and fisheries productivity to climatic features (growing degree-days, rainfall, sea surface temperatures), the role of ecosystem services is understudied. We seek to fill this gap with this project by analyzing how the impacts of climate change could depend upon the gradual evolution of ecosystem health. We will also take into account and use all possible available data on the health of ecosystems in North-West Africa.  
> 
> Our  second area of study aims to deepen the understanding of the channels by which impacts on food systems could threaten human health. Food scarcity, due to crop failure and weakened fisheries, can lead to malnutrition; foods deficient in essential nutrients like protein, zinc, and iron can lead to nutrient deficiency; and increased harmful algal blooms can result in shellfish poisoning.
> 
> The food system is complex, with some populations particularly vulnerable to near-term climate impacts. Such effects have significant implications for our ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. SDG 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15). We will determine  the consequences for low-income countries like those in North-West Africa, and their most vulnerable populations, in collaboration with researchers having existing stakeholder relationships and access to on-the-ground data. We are interested in identifying health disparities between groups, with a view toward social justice, and determine how vulnerable they are as a result of climate change impact on the food industry. Our goal is to co-create tools or data facilitating the resilience of these vulnerable groups to health risks, as well as design and suggest mitigation and adaptation policies and risk management.
> 
> Two vulnerable populations of particular interest to our group have emerged from our conversations to-date. First, we are interested in studying the impacts on migrants and displaced people. These groups, often detached from support networks and consuming substandard food, represent a valuable case study for wider future impacts. Involuntary displacement is also expected to increase under climate change, due to climate disasters and degraded ecosystems. Hence, we will uncover the effects on, and climate-driven increase of, these vulnerable groups. Alternatively, we could focus on farmers and fishers. Subsistence producers and small-holder producers who use proceeds to purchase food are particularly vulnerable. In addition, heat has direct impacts on farmer/fisher health and can undermine other sources of rural income.

**assistant**:
> Certainly, here are a few suggestions for a project title with catchy acronyms:
> 
> 1. **C**limate **I**mpacts on **A**griculture, **F**isheries, and **H**ealth **S**ustainability (CIAFHS)
> 
> 2. **C**limate **H**azard **A**ssessment for **R**esilient **A**griculture and **F**isheries **IS**sues (CHARAFIS)

> 
> Remember, assigning an acronym to your research project can help make it more memorable and catchy for reviewers and readers, but it's important that the acronym aligns well with the project's main focus and doesn't oversimplify or misrepresent it.

> N - **N**ourishing
> U - **U**plift
