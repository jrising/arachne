> To calculate the indirect multiplier effect from the output of an IMPLAN impact analysis, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Find the total output multiplier (also known as the total economic impact multiplier) for the region or industry you are analyzing. This can typically be found in the output tables of the IMPLAN software. The total output multiplier represents the total change in output (or economic activity) resulting from a change in final demand for goods or services.
> 
> 2. Subtract the direct effect from the total output multiplier. The direct effect represents the initial change in output resulting from the change in final demand, while the indirect effect represents the subsequent changes in output resulting from the ripple effects of that initial change. 
> 
> 3. The result of step 2 represents the indirect effect, or the indirect multiplier effect. This indicates the additional changes in output that occur as the result of the indirect effects of the initial change in demand. 
> 
> For example, if the total output multiplier is 2.5 and the direct effect is 1.0, then the indirect effect (or indirect multiplier effect) would be 1.5 (2.5 - 1.0 = 1.5). This indicates that for every dollar of direct economic activity generated by the initial change in demand, an additional 1.5 dollars of economic activity will be generated indirectly throughout the region or industry.
