> When people talk about ozone as a pollutant affecting health and agriculture, they are referring to **locally-produced near-surface ozone**. This type of ozone is formed by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. The process is influenced by local factors such as pollution levels, weather, and geography. This ground-level ozone can have harmful effects on human health and vegetation. It is distinct from the stratospheric ozone layer, which is involved in global processes related to ozone depletion but does not directly impact health and agriculture in the same way.

> How far does ground-level ozone disperse?
**assistant**:
> Ground-level ozone disperses over relatively short distances due to its formation process and local conditions. Factors like wind speed, temperature, and the presence of pollutants influence its dispersion. Generally, **ground-level ozone can affect areas within a few kilometers of its source**, but concentrations diminish significantly beyond that range. In some cases, under certain weather conditions, it might travel a bit further, but it is largely a **localized pollutant**. Thus, the specific distance that ground-level ozone disperses can vary widely depending on various environmental factors.
