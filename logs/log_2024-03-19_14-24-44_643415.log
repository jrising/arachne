> how do i get companies in the real estate sector to fund this project? "The goal of a Hub is to encourage a market shift toward better performing buildings by spotlighting best practices of local market leaders, convening industry to discuss related issues, and aiding those who may not otherwise have the information, expertise, or finances to take action."\
**assistant**:
> To encourage real estate companies to fund your Hub project, here are some steps that might help you:
> 
> **1. Identify Potential Companies:**
> Establish a list of potential industries and companies that might be interested in higher performance buildings. These should ideally be companies that will directly benefit from the success of your project, or have a social responsibility inclination towards 'green' or sustainable projects.
> 
> **2. Understand Their Interests:**
> Research what these companies have gained from similar projects, both in terms of solid profits and intangible benefits. Understand their company values and mission statements to align those with your project's benefits.
> 
> **3. Develop a Tailored Proposal:**
> Detail the direct benefits of your project for the companies you approach. Outline potential property value appreciation, operational cost savings, compliance with fast-approaching green building regulations, and branding advantages. Also highlight the long-term advantages, such as the potential for community development, industry leadership, and environmental stewardship.
> 
> **4. Show the Benefits for Tenants:**
> Potential tenants increasingly prefer green and energy-efficient buildings. Highlight these benefits, along with potential improvements to health, wellbeing and productivity.
> 
> **5. Collate Success Stories:**
> If there have been successful similar projects, use them as examples to reinforce your proposal. Concrete examples and hard data are generally more persuasive than projections and models.
> 
> **6. Engage in Networking:**
> Attend real estate industry conferences, seminars, and meetings to network with key people in your target companies. Informal introductions often work better to get prospective stakeholders interested in your project.
> 
> **7. Consider Hiring a Broker:**
> If the project is large and thus the financing stakes are high, consider hiring a broker or intermediary who specializes in matching prospective investors to projects.
> 
> Above all, ensure the proposed project aligns with the interests and values of the companies you aim to attract. Demonstrating a good rate of return on investment, both in financial and public relation/brand terms, and addressing potential risks will be key elements of a successful strategy.
