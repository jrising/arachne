> I have some code that needs to run under python2. How can I install virtualenv for py2 and then run it as such?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! To set up a virtual environment using Python 2, you'll need to follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Install `virtualenv` for Python 2:**
> 
>     If you're operating on a system where Python 2 might no longer be the default, you may need to explicitly call `pip2`. Assuming `pip2` is installed, run:
> 
>     ```sh
>     pip2 install virtualenv
>     ```
> 
> 2. **Create a virtual environment for Python 2:**
> 
>     You can create a virtual environment using the `virtualenv` command and specifying the Python 2 interpreter. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment and run:
> 
>     ```sh
>     virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 my_py2_env
>     ```
> 
>     Here, `my_py2_env` represents the directory name for your virtual environment, and `/usr/bin/python2.7` is the path to the Python 2 interpreter on your system. Adjust the path as necessary.
> 
> 3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
> 
>     To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:
> 
>     ```sh
>     source my_py2_env/bin/activate
>     ```
> 
>     Your shell prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active. You should now be using Python 2 within this environment.
> 
> 4. **Install necessary packages:**
> 
>     With the virtual environment activated, you can install any necessary packages using `pip`. For example:
> 
>     ```sh
>     pip install some_package
>     ```
> 
> 5. **Run your Python 2 code:**
> 
>     While the virtual environment is active, you can run your Python 2 scripts as usual:
> 
>     ```sh
>     python my_script.py
>     ```
> 
> 6. **Deactivate the virtual environment:**
> 
>     When you're finished, deactivate the virtual environment by running:
> 
>     ```sh
>     deactivate
>     ```
> 
> That's it! You now have a Python 2 virtual environment set up and ready to use. If you have any further questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
