**assistant**:
> To add extra space to the bottom of a graph in `ggplot2`, you can use the `theme()` function with the `plot.margin` argument. You'll want to specify a larger value for the bottom margin. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```R
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Example ggplot
> p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
>   geom_point()
> 
> # Extend the space at the bottom of the plot
> p + theme(
>   plot.margin = margin(t = 5, r = 5, b = 20, l = 5, unit = "pt")
> )
> ```
> 
> In this example, the `plot.margin` is set using the `margin()` function, where `t`, `r`, `b`, and `l` stand for top, right, bottom, and left margins, respectively. The numbers correspond to the amount of space (in points) you want to add, and you can adjust the value for `b` (bottom) to fit your needs. The `"unit"` argument allows specifying the unit of measurement, with common options being "pt" (points), "cm" (centimeters), or "in" (inches).
