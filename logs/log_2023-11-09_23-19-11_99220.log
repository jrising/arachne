> Loss and Damage Today: How climate change is impacting output and capital
> 1. Executive Summary
> TODO
> 2. Introduction and Background
> 
> The planet has already warmed by 1.34 °C [1.2 - 1.5 °C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. As the climate shifts, recent evidence has shown that economic growth can be depressed. Already, today we are likely to be poorer as a world because of these impacts than we would have been. In lower-income, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be particularly large.
> 
> We can compare these results to a recent expert review of global damage relationships. The results from Howard & Sterner (2017) suggest that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> This report develops best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome is percent reductions in GDP and percent reductions in capital wealth today, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses provides new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change.
> 3. Methodology
> The methodology for estimating the macroeconomic effects of climate change consists of three main components: a literature review, a machine learning approach, and indirect effect modeling. Each component contributes to understanding the potential economic losses due to climate change.
> 
> The research team identified eight critical papers that have significantly advanced our understanding of the macroeconomic impacts of climate change. These papers cover a range of insights, including the vulnerability of low-income countries, adaptation potential, and the persistence of economic growth. The team assessed and implemented a total of 61 unique models from these papers.
> 
> To assess the models, meta-data was collected under 11 distinct headings that represent various aspects of model sophistication and data quality. These dimensions include weather aggregation weighting schemes, representation of temperature and rainfall variables, treatment of differential vulnerability for poor countries, handling of unobserved heterogeneity, consideration of nonlinear socioeconomic trends, inclusion of additional factors and controls, and data recency and span.
> 
> All the models were estimated using econometric methods and employed high-quality weather and economic output data. The detailed ratings of these models allowed for an objective comparison and identification of their relative strengths and weaknesses. This information aided the subsequent integration of models using a machine learning approach.
> 
> For projections, the analysis starts with ERA5 reanalysis weather data from 1940 to 2022. Historical weather data is aggregated to the country level. Monte Carlo simulations are applied to account for the inherent uncertainty in model parameters. These simulations draw model parameters from their respective probability distributions. The models are then simulated for each country under two conditions: actual weather conditions and a hypothetical scenario where the climate remains unchanged. The difference in economic outcomes between these conditions represents the immediate impact of climate change on a country’s GDP.
> 
> The impacts are aggregated over time for each country, considering the possibility of persistent impacts that lead to permanently lower growth trajectories. The aggregation formula incorporates a recovery rate from climate shocks. The rate of recovery is set to 0.25 based on previous work by Nath et al. (2023). Figure 1 shows these impacts for each model aggregated to the global level.
> 
> Figure 1
> 
> 
> The machine learning approach integrates the individual contributions of the assessed models to determine the impact and costs of climate change across nations. Each model is assigned quality values for various attributes based on assessed model quality. These quality values range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating excellent quality and 0 indicating poor quality.
> 
> A random forest machine learning model is then fitted for each country-year-Monte Carlo draw using the direct impact models. This random forest takes into account the quality values assigned to each attribute. By querying the random forest model with quality values set to 1 for all attributes, the damages of climate change are inferred under optimum conditions for each attribute. This approach provides a robust estimate of potential economic costs for each country. The result is the direct impact of climate change on GDP for each country, and shown as a global aggregate in Figure 2.
> 
> Figure 2
> 
> 
> 
> The international effects of climate change are addressed by considering the spill-over effects of losses on other economies through international trade. The analysis calibrates these effects using Brexit CGE studies, which provide estimates of losses to GDP, exports, and imports in different Brexit scenarios. The relationship between import and export changes and GDP loss is represented using a regression model based on the observed results of the Brexit studies.
> 
> The analysis also incorporates capital dynamics by developing a model based on the Solow growth model and the Inclusive Wealth capital framework. This model captures produced, human, and renewable capital dynamics for all countries. It uses data on GDP, population, savings rates, agriculture’s share of GDP, and capital estimates from the Inclusive Wealth Report. Model parameters are calibrated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
> 
> The reporting of results involves calculating the population-weighted median across Monte Carlo draws, along with the interquartile range, to quantify the potential economic losses caused by climate change.
> 
> Overall, the methodology encompasses a comprehensive analysis combining literature review, machine learning techniques, and economic modeling to provide a detailed understanding of the potential economic losses resulting from climate change.
> 4. Results and Findings
> The climatic changes experienced since the mid-20th century have resulted in evident and significant economic impacts across the globe. Our analysis of the relationship between climate change and GDP losses is built on a solid foundation of existing research and enriched with machine learning techniques. Here, we discuss results due to climate change today. These impacts, both positive and negative, vary widely by region and are largely dependent on the underlying economic structure and climatic vulnerability of each country.
> Global and Regional Impacts Today
> Globally, the population-weighted GDP loss due to climate change in 2022 is substantial at 6.4%, taking into account the direct, international, and capital losses related to climate. Yet, the percentage of the global GDP lost is 0.6%, as many wealthier nations have smaller impacts or benefits. These figures vividly illustrate the inequality in the impacts of climate change across regions and economic zones, as demonstrated by the map of losses across the globe (See Figure 3).
> 
> Figure 3
> 
> 
> In contrast with the global average, the Global South and particularly tropical regions, have borne the brunt of climate related losses. African nations have experienced an average loss of 10% in GDP in 2022. Most severely impacted is Southern Africa, which has suffered an average loss of 17% of GDP (See Figure 5). These staggering numbers underscore the vulnerability of these regions to climate disruptions and their negative socio-economic effects.
> 
> Interestingly, some regions, particularly Europe and northern Asia, have actually seen economic benefits from climate change. Europe and Central Asia have registered increases of 5% and 7% in GDP respectively (See Figure 4). These benefits arise from reduced winter chill, which lowers energy consumption and mortality rates, among other factors.
> 
> Figure 4
> 
> 
> The United States and China are both near the point where losses under hotter temperatures outweigh benefits from milder winters. The US saw a 2% gain in GDP in 2022, while China experienced no change.
> 
> While the direct impacts from local temperature remain the dominant factor in most regions, there were also significant international effects and capital losses. In countries outside Europe and North America, international impacts amplified losses by about 1 pp. Capital effects further increase losses by 1-2 pp in most regions.
> Economic Group Results and Implications
> Consistent with the overall regional results, the economic impacts of climate change present a stark contrast between developed and developing nations. For the developed world or OECD countries, small aggregate losses or gains from climate change are estimated [IQR 3% loss to 5% gain].
> 
> Figure 5
> 
> 
> Meanwhile, low-income countries have been heavily impacted, averaging an 11% loss of GDP [6 - 15%]. This exacerbates the already glaring global inequality and underscores the disproportionate burden of climate change on these nations.
> 
> The cost to high-income countries has been minimal, in fact they have seen a net gain of approximately $287 billion (constant 2015 USD). Meanwhile, the rest of the world has experienced an estimated net GDP loss of $1217 billion (see Table 1).
> 
> These findings not only highlight the current economic disparities caused by climate change, but also provide insights into the potential future trajectories if these trends continue unchecked.
> UNFCCC Party Groupings and Economic Impacts
> Figure 6 provides a visualization of these results by UNFCCC party groupings.
> 
> Many coalition groups which represent developing countries have experienced average losses in 2022 of around 10% of their GDP. This signifies the substantial economic burdens faced by these countries due to climate change impacts. The average loss for the G-77 is 6% of GDP, with a range of 1% to 10%. The Small Island Developing States (SIDS) under the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) have experienced an average loss of 9%, with a range of 4% to 11%. However, it is worth noting that these estimates likely underestimate the actual losses for SIDS, as they do not fully account for the impacts of sea-level rise, a significant concern for these vulnerable nations.
> 
> Figure 6
> 
> In contrast to the economic losses experienced by many developing countries, the European Union (EU) demonstrates average gains in GDP of 2%, with a range of a 2% loss to a 5% gain. The EU’s positive economic impacts reflect the benefits it has derived from climate change, particularly in regions such as Europe and Central Asia, where reduced winter chill has led to improved economic outcomes Figure 4.
> Global and Country Trends in GDP Losses
> Our study suggests a strong correlation between GDP losses attributable to climate change and rising temperatures. Since 1960, we have observed a nearly linear increase in global temperatures of 1°C, in pace with a corresponding reduction in global population-weighted GDP by approximately 6.4% (Figure 7). Incremental increases in temperature have consistently mapped to escalating losses in GDP, and these losses are expected to accelerate in the future.
> 
> Figure 7
> 
> 
> 
> Our geographic analysis of these trends, however, reveals marked disparities across territories. Climate change is not an indiscriminate phenomenon; its effects manifest divergently across different regions and in varying magnitudes, as seen in Figure 8.
> 
> Figure 8
> 
> 
> A case in point is Russia, which has seen a 13% increase in GDP [10 - 17%] attributable to climate change. However, these results are premised on the assumption that temperatures do not affect fossil fuel extraction, a significant component of Russia’s economy. The milder winters experienced as a result of climate change may have catalyzed economic activities, leading to the counter-intuitive GDP increase.
> 
> Contrastingly, Saudi Arabia has endured a 13% [3 - 19%] drop in GDP owing to climate change, under the same assumption about fossil fuel extraction. Harsher temperatures could have adversely affected the country’s other economic sectors, offsetting any advantages gained in oil extraction efficiency from warmer climes.
> 
> The figure also shows the effects of climate change on the world’s two biggest economies: the US and China. Coincidentally, both countries currently hover near the break-even point, revealing neither significant GDP losses from excessively high temperatures nor substantial gains from comparatively milder winters.
> 
> It is worth noting that these situations might be transient. As global temperatures continue to inch upward, the subtle balance maintained by these nations could easily tip into the negative axis, leading to unprecedented economic strain.
> 
> There is also considerable variability from year to year. The median country varies by ± 1 percentage point in the GDP effect of climate change.
> Capital Losses and the Erosion of Productive Capacity
> The repercussions of climate change extend beyond immediate GDP losses; they also reverberate through capital investments, resulting in a decline in a country’s total stock of produced capital. Consequently, our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in the magnitude of capital losses experienced across different income groups and geographic regions.
> 
> Broadly speaking, countries confronted with climate impacts suffer from diminished capital investments, exacerbating the erosion of their productive capacity over time. The extent of these capital losses carries critical implications for long-term economic resilience and the ability to sustain growth.
> 
> High-income countries have witnessed a substantial reduction in their produced capital, estimated at $549 billion less than they would have had in the absence of climate impacts (Table 1). This figure underscores the significance of climate change as a formidable downward force on capital accumulation in economically advanced nations, even where GDP effects are positive.

> In the rest of the world, comprising low and middle-income countries, there have been even more pronounced capital losses, totaling $2033 billion.
> 
> Renewable capital, a vital component of sustainable development, is influenced by climate change dynamics in more nuanced ways. Our models consider two factors that simultaneously exert opposing influences on renewable capital.
> 
> Firstly, we model temperature as having a generally negative effect on the natural world’s ability to generate ecosystem services, thus potentially tempering the growth of renewable capital. On the other hand, reductions in GDP resulting from climate change can alleviate strain on the natural world, engendering scope for capital growth.
> 
> When these effects are weighed, a net loss of $339 billion in rich countries and $583 billion in the rest of the world emerges for renewable capital (Figure 9). However, notably, low-income countries exhibit a counterintuitive trend, experiencing an increase of $134 billion in renewable capital.

> 
> The report investigates the current macroeconomic losses resulting from climate change and provides valuable insights into the impacts on global GDP and capital wealth. The research highlights the significant disparities in the effects of climate change across different regions and economic zones, emphasizing the vulnerability of low-income countries and tropical regions. The findings support the urgent need for developing countries to demand support and assistance from wealthier nations in mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change.
> 
> Globally, climate change has already caused a substantial population-weighted GDP loss of 6.4% in 2022 when considering direct, international, and capital losses. However, the distribution of these losses is highly uneven, with wealthier nations experiencing smaller impacts or even benefiting from climate change, while the Global South suffers the most significant losses. African nations, particularly Southern Africa, bear the brunt of these impacts, with an average GDP loss of 10% and 17%, respectively.
> 
> In terms of economic groupings, developed countries (OECD) exhibit minimal losses or gains from climate change, while low-income countries face an average GDP loss of 11%. This exacerbates existing global inequality and calls for comprehensive strategies to address the disproportionate burden faced by developing nations.
> 
> Furthermore, the analysis reveals the complex interplay between climate change, economic dynamics, and capital investments. High-income countries witness substantial reductions in produced capital, emphasizing the erosion of their productive capacity over time. The rest of the world, comprising low and middle-income countries, experiences even more significant capital losses, highlighting the challenges faced by these nations in sustaining growth and resilience.
> 
> The report provides valuable insights for policymakers and international organizations, particularly in anticipation of COP28. The comprehensive methodology employed, which combines literature review, machine learning techniques, and economic modeling, contributes to a detailed understanding of the potential economic losses caused by climate change.
