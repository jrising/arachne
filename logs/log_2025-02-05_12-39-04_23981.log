>     Climate change is expected to impose heterogeneous damages across the globe due to varying levels of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. The social cost of carbon (SCCO$_2$), the net present value of welfare losses from an additional ton of CO$_2$, provides a useful synthesis of these damages to highlight their spatial patterns.  This paper presents an extension of the PAGE-2020 integrated assessment model across 183 individual countries and five small country groups. We incorporate several critical improvements: a novel mapping of climate uncertainty to country-level warming patterns, calibration using new socioeconomic projections and empirical risk indices for dynamic vulnerability, refined models of market, non-market, and sea-level rise damages, and updated abatement cost estimates using NGFS energy model scenarios. These changes result in a global SCCO$_2$ of \$219.75 per ton of CO$_2$. We then decompose the spatial pattern of country-level SCCO$_2$ into the role of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, by calibrating a simple emulator with temperature, population, and income, which captures the country-level SCCO$_2$ pattern with high precision. We use this to evaluate the role of different modeling decisions, including different scenarios, downscaling, damage assumptions, abatement costs, and assumptions about sub-national vulnerability. While the spatial pattern roughly follows GDP, but with tropical countries at twice their GDP-only SCCO$_2$ level and cooler countries below this level. Across modeling decisions, the greatest changes in spatial pattern are driven by the use of SSP scenarios (rather than the default RFFSPs) and the updating of non-market damages damages to reflect \citet{howard2017few}.

> \section{Introduction}
> 
> The heterogeneity of damages across regions has emerged as one of the central challenges of climate change \citep{hsiang2019distribution}. Considering temperature hazards alone, the tropics are exposed to the greatest extremes, upper latitudes are exposed to the most rapid increases, and many temperate zones are exposed to large and increasing variability. Furthermore, by a combination of chance, history, and restricted opportunities, the most vulnerable people are often also exposed to the greatest hazards. In this way, hetergeneity drives concerns over climate injustice and crucially informs the needs for adaptation and resilience planning.
> 
> Heterogeneity is also a necessary input to calculate the social cost of carbon (SCCO$_2$) \citep{anthoff2019inequality}. The SCCO$_2$ is defined as the global damages resulting from the emissions of 1 ton of CO$_2$, including discounted future damages. Standard welfare economic principles derive discounting and the accounting of unequal climate damages from a common consideration of the different values of an additional dollar to richer and poorer people.
> 
> One tool for understanding the interaction between climate, risks, and mitigation is the benefit-cost integrated assessment models (BC-IAMs) \citep{rising2022challenges}. BC-IAMs represent feedbacks between emissions, climate damages, and the economy, allowing for the calculation of the SCCO$_2$ and benefit-cost analysis of climate policy.  However, traditionally these have only included a small number of regions: for example 1 region (DICE \citep{nordhaus2018evolution}), 8 (PAGE \citep{kikstra2021social}), 12 (RICE \citep{nordhaus2017integrated}), and 16 (FUND \citep{waldhoffmarginal}). While most BC-IAMs emphasize a top-down approach to understanding the climate problem, using emulated relationships to describe warming, impacts and damages, and mitigation costs, the lack of spatial resolution can misrepresent expected costs and benefits of climate mitigation.
> 
> In this paper, we expand the Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE-2020) integrated assessment model \citep{kikstra2021social} to model country-level damages, mitigation, and adaptation. This work has entailed a number of contributions to the top-down modeling of these features. In particular, we discuss (1) a new mapping between continuous climate uncertainty and climate warming patterns; (2) an extension of GDP-based damages to allow for dynamic vulnerability; (3) the calibration on country-level abatement costs from energy model simulations; and (4) a mechanism to account for subnational damage distributions. Part 1 describes all updates to the PAGE model to produce country-level results. Part 2 provides estimates of damages across the globe, across time and mitigation scenarios. Part 3 evaluates the modeling improvements by considering how they affect the distribution of the SCCO$_2$ across uncertainty and space.
> 
> \section{Updates to the PAGE-2020 Model}
> 
> PAGE is an advanced Benefit-Cost Integrated Assessment Model running from 2015 to 2300 that emphasizes top-down damages while incorporating climate mechanics and economic markers. It incorporates several frontier features for climate economics analysis, including (1) gas cycles for six emissions classes (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, N$_2$O, SF$_6$, sulfate aerosols, and a residual group for other greenhouse gas emissions), (2) empirical-based market damages, and non-market, sea-level rise, and discontinuity damages, (3) adaptation costs associated with each damage class, (4) abatement costs and a price policy associated with each greenhouse gas, (5) uncertainty over 150 parameter distributions. The model has also been extended to represent annual weather variation and partial persistence in damages \citep{kikstra2021social}, although these updates are not used in this paper.
> 
> Prior to this paper, the PAGE model included eight multi-country regions. Table \ref{tbl:execsum} summarizes the updates to the PAGE-2020 model in this paper, associated with improvements in the spatial resolution of the model.

> All countries with populations greater than 300 thousand (2015 estimate) are included individually, and the remaining have been grouped into five aggregates (see figure \ref{fig:page-map}). The country-level version of PAGE includes 178 countries and 5 additional aggregate regions.

> \subsection{RFF Probabilistic Scenarios}
> 
> We further allow the probabilistic scenario and baseline emissions from the RFF probabilistic scenarios \citep{rennert2022social}. In particular, we rely upon the Monte Carlo estimates of population growth and GDP per capita growth by country. We also use these to adjust the emissions growth rates, following a simplified Kaya identity: $\text{Emissions} =  (\text{Population}) (\text{GDP per capita}) (\text{Emissions Intensity of GDP})$. Assuming that the emissions intensity of GDP is unchanged for a given country and time period, we can adjust the emissions from the SSPs as follows:
> 
> \[
>     \text{Emissions} = \text{Emissions}_\text{SSP} \nicefrac{\text{GDP}_\text{RFF}}{\text{GDP}_\text{SSP}}
> \]
> 
> which implies that
> \[
>     \text{Emissions growth} = \text{Emissions growth}_\text{SSP} + \text{GDP growth}_\text{RFF} + \text{GDP growth}_\text{SSP}
> \]
> 
> \subsection{Climate Downscaling}
> 
> We apply an improved Monte Carlo pattern/residual (MCPR) method to map simple climate model GMST temperatures to country-level temperature patterns \citep{rasmussen2016probability}. The method used by \citet{rasmussen2016probability} decomposes GCM warming into a global component and residual patterns, and then patterns can be applied randomly. Instead of using patterns across the entire temperature range, we assign patterns to different overlapping segments of the temperature space, like the surrogate/model mixed ensemble (SMME) method described by the same reference.
> 
> We use a collection of downscaled GCMs from \citet{fick2017worldclim} (WorldClim) to represent the variation in patterns of warming across the globe. Each warming pattern is applied to the global mean warming levels given by the PAGE Monte Carlo runs. The WorldClim downscaled results are available for 9 GCMs, at 10'' resolution, as 20-year averages. 
> 
> The comparison to the global GCM warming levels to the distribution from FaIR (similar to PAGE's climate model) is shown in figure \ref{fig:faircmip6}.
> 
> \begin{figure}[htbp]
>     \centering
>     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/timeseries.pdf}
>     \caption{The confidence intervals around FaIR Monte Carlos, compared to the downscaled GCMs.}
>     \label{fig:faircmip6}
> \end{figure}
> 
> To assign a GCM warming pattern to each FaIR Monte Carlo scenario, we start by determining the reliability of ordering between the GCM models. If the GCMs had identical warming patterns, the order of GCMs according to global temperatures would match the order of GCMs for each pixel. In this case, we would strictly partition the temperature space, assigning a range of temperatures to each GCM. If there is disagreement between the ordering of GCMs at a pixel level, the warming ranges for each GCM should correspondingly overlap.
> 
> We define the relative probability of each GCM at a given temperature level according to a normal distribution. The temperature in 2081-2100 is taken as an index of the warming for each model. The relative probability of GCM $i$ at 2081-2100 temperature $T$ is $N(T | T_{GCM}, \tau)$. $\tau$ determines the degree of overlap between models. 
> 
> To determine the degree of overlap, we calculate grid-level correlations between GCM-anomalies and GCM-level temperature. We then calibrate $\tau$ so that the correlation between the vector of 2081-2100 global temperatures and the temperatures for the stochastically assigned GCMs matches this correlation. We find that $\tau = 0.2158$ for SSP1-2.6, and $\tau = 0.4013$ for SSP3-7.0. We then determine a pattern for each hundreth of a degree in 2100 which is identical for both SSP scenarios, by randomly drawing GCMs using this method for each Monte Carlo until both scenarios give the same pattern. The final assignment of patterns is shown in figure \ref{fig:gendists}.

> \subsection{Market Damages}
> 
> We implement country-specific empirical relationships, based on country deviations from the model in \citet{burke2015global}. We then build a model to explain those deviations using values from the INFORM risk index, to reflect changing vulnerability.
> 
> The current market damages estimates, which reflect the main result of \citet{burke2015global}, do not allow for adaptation or differential vulnerability, which are strengths of PAGE.
> 
> \citet{burke2015global} reports country-level estimates of the marginal effect of temperature on GDP growth (see figure \ref{fig:burke-deviations}). We would like to evaluate these differences relative to indices that describe the historical vulnerability of countries. The IPCC's AR6 WGII report considered two of these indices, the INFORM Risk Index and WorldRiskIndex. We evaluate the ability of these indices and of log GDP per capita to explain the deviation. The INFORM risk estimates both explain the estimates and conform to the theory that higher-vulnerability countries should see greater marginal losses to temperature increases (see figure \ref{fig:index-eval}). In addition, future projected INFORM indices are available to describing future vulnerability.

> 
> We derive a new estimate of non-market damages using the meta-analysis by \citet{howard2017few}. The approach also uses PAGE's method of determining willingness-to-pay as a function of income levels.
> 
> The following text is modified from the supplemental information

> 
> Market damages are those climate damages affecting economic activity mediated by money. Market damages do not include estimates of the welfare cost of climate change outside markets, for example loss of human life or damages to ecosystems that can be priced at people's willingness to pay (WTP) to preserve those ecosystems' existence. `Non-market' damages are more uncertain than their market counterparts, but in many IAMs they occupy a substantial share of total welfare damages from climate change \citep[e.g.][]{nordhaus2000warning, Rennert2022}.
> 
> The current estimate of non-market damages in PAGE have not been recently calibrated. As part of a separate project, we have implemented non-market damages using the structure described by the MERGE IAM \citep{manne2005merge}, with an updated calibration derived from \citet{howard2017few}. The MERGE model places particular emphasis on the representation of non-market damages, with a WTP measure that depends on both income and temperature. While the parameters of the MERGE non-market damage module are speculative, its use of an S-shaped elasticity of WTP with respect to income is theoretically coherent. 
> 
> Like the MERGE model, the damage function meta-analysis by \citet{howard2017few} assumes that damages grow quadratically with warming from a pre-industrial baseline. Under their preferred model, total damages as a percent of GDP (including market and non-market impacts) follow $\num{0.595} \Delta \overline{T_{AT}}(t)^2$. Considering only damage functions that exclude non-market damages, their key coefficient is reduced by \num{0.487}.\footnote{This coefficient comes from table 2, column 3 of \citet{howard2017few}. While their preferred model is column 4, that model has a market-only reduction of \num{0.622}, larger than the total damage coefficient. Columns 3 and 4 estimate identical values for the total damage coefficient, so we use the more conservative value.} We use this as evidence that non-market damages follow $\num{0.487} \Delta \overline{T_{AT}}(t)^2$. As in \citet{howard2017few}, we increase this coefficient by 25\%, to $\num{0.609}$, to account for potential omitted (non-catastrophic) damages. This gives a 90\% increase in WTP relative to \citet{manne2005merge}. At 2.5$^{\circ}$C warming, WTP is 3.8\% of GDP, compared to 2.0\% in the original MERGE calibration (see Figure \ref{fig:merge-dmgfunc}).

> This WTP applies at high incomes. MERGE provides a model to link WTP to income, which we maintain. At \$25k/capita, WTP to avoid 2.5$^{\circ}$C warming is held at 1\%. As income increases above that level, WTP asymptotically approaches the non-market damages from \citet{howard2017few}. WTP to avoid warming as a function of income is shown in Figure \ref{fig:merge-scurve}.

The model was introduced and is described in detail in \citet{diaz2016estimating}. The data and implementation that we rely upon here is drawn from \citet{depsky2023dscim}, updated as part of the Climate Impact Lab's Social Cost of Carbon work.
> 
> CIAM works at a high spatial resolution by building on the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) database \citep{hinkel2009integrating}. DIVA partitions the world’s coastlines into \num{12148} segments with homogeneous physical characteristics. The median length of a segment is 18km. South Korea's coastline, for example, is divided into \num{105} segments. Cost estimates at the segment level can be aggregated to coarser spatial scales, for example the country and global levels. CIAM runs in time steps of 10 years. It is initialised in the year 2000 and can run up to 2200, though we mainly focus on the period up to 2100. The base year currency is 2010 US dollars.
> 
> Each segment in CIAM is described by its physical attributes (coastline length, surface area by elevation, storm surge frequency, wetland extent), socio-economic attributes (income, population density, capital stock), as well as protection costs. Physical attributes are taken from DIVA, while socio-economic attributes and protection costs are derived from a range of sources described in \citet{diaz2016estimating}. While some segment attributes such as length are time-invariant, most are time-varying. Future segment population is based on the United Nations’ projections, while future segment income is based on IMF projections.
> 
> There are five categories of coastal impact in CIAM:
> \begin{itemize}
> \item Protection costs (construction of sea walls, dikes, etc.);
> \item Retreat costs (relocating people and mobile capital inland, and demolishing immobile capital);
> \item Inundation costs (the value of lost land, and immobile capital abandoned);
> \item Wetland costs (the value of lost wetland ecosystem services);
> \item Flood costs (expected damage to capital stocks and expected mortality from storm surges).
> \end{itemize}
> 
> The overall cost of sea level rise is the sum of each of these five cost categories, the first two of which can be regarded as adaptation costs, while the latter three can be regarded as residual damages.
> 
> Both overall costs and their composition depends on what is assumed about adaptation. In general, each segment possesses a social planner who solves the following optimisation problem for his/her own segment:
> \begin{align*}
> \text{OverallCost} =& \min_s \sum_{t \in \Delta t} \left[\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}\left(\text{ProtectionCost}_{st} + \text{RetreatCost}_{st} + \right.\right.\\
> & \left.\left.\text{InundationCost}_{st} +\text{WetlandCost}_{st} + \text{FloodCost}_{st} \right)\right]
> \end{align*}
> where $s$ is the adaptation strategy, $\Delta t$ is the adaptation planning period comprising decadal time-steps $t$, and $r$ is the discount rate.
> 
> When the adaptation strategy $s$ corresponds to no adaptation, $\text{ProtectionCost}_t = 0$ for all $t$ and $\text{RetreatCost}_t$ is optimally chosen to react to sea level rise at the same time step. Alternatively, when $s$ corresponds to optimal adaptation, both $\text{ProtectionCost}$ and $\text{RetreatCost}$ are chosen once during each adaptation planning period in order to minimise the discounted $\text{OverallCost}$ of sea level rise in the current and next adaptation planning periods.
> 
> This problem is solved independently for each of CIAM’s \num{12148} segments and sequentially for each adaptation planning period. Thus, when adapting optimally the planner looks forward one period in each planning period. Perfect foresight is assumed, which is unrealistic but necessary for computational tractability given so many optimisation problems are being solved simultaneously. The default adaptation planning periods are 40 years, with shorter initial and final periods, i.e.: 2000; 2010-2040; 2050-2090; 2100-2140; 2150-2180; 2190-2200.

> 
> \subsection{Abatement costs}
> 
> Updated abatement costs estimates rely upon a country-level downscaling of abatement scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). These use results from GCAM, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM and REMIND-MAgPIE. We use all available scenarios under Phase 3 of that project (\url{https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs-phase-3/}).
> 
> Two emulators are developed using this data, to describe (1) how emissions are reduced as a function of carbon price, and (2) how GDP is reduced as a function of carbon price. We estimate a piece-wise linear curve, constrained so that higher carbon prices produce both higher mitigation and higher costs. We also assume that these relationships change over time. The emulator regressions are:
> 
> \begin{align}
>     \text{Emit}_i =& \sum_k \alpha_k S_k(p_i) + \sum_k \beta_k S_k(p_i) (t_i - 2000) + \gamma \text{LagEmit}_i + \delta_{t_i} + \eta_{m_i} \\
>     \text{LogGDP}_i =& \sum_k \alpha_k S_k(p_i) + \sum_k \beta_k S_k(p_i) (2050 - t_i) + \gamma \text{LagLogGDP}_i + \delta_{t_i} + \eta_{m_i} \\
> \end{align}
> such that $\alpha_k < 0, \beta_k < 0, \gamma > 0, \delta_t > 0, \eta_m > 0$.
> 
> Finally, we impose a regularization on the resulting mitigation relationships, so that total abatement asymptotically approaches 100\%. This is
> \begin{equation}
> \text{RawFractionAbated} / (exp(-\text{CarbonPriceUSD} / 500) + \text{RawFractionAbated})
> \end{equation}

> \subsection{Subnational damages}
> 
> While national units are appropriate for many applications, including mitigation policy and loss \& damage remuneration, they are still coarse reletaive to the heterogeneity in damages \citep{hsiang2017estimating, carleton2022valuing}. In this section, we provide a mechanism to adjust national damages accounting for subnational damage distributions.
> 
> This correction presumes a level of equity-weighting \citep{anthoff2009equity}. Since the damages are calibrated to reflect national totals, these and the associated SCCO$_2$ values are correct in the absence of equity-weighting. However, since standard utility functions are concave, equity-weighting is an appropriate reflection of the welfare economic theory.
> 
> We start by assuming that subnational incomes are log-normally distributed, and use Gini coefficients from the INFORM Risk 2023 dataset to calibrate these distributions, so that the income for individual $i$ from country $j$ is described as
> \[
> \log{y_{ji}} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{y}_j - \nicefrac{\sigma_j^2}{2}, \sigma_j^2)
> \]
> where $\sigma_j = \sqrt{2} \phi^{-1}(\nicefrac{\text{Gini}_j / 100 + 1}{2})$.
> 
> We also define a vulnerability coefficient, $v_{ji}$, also log-normally distributed. Damages for individual $i$ are defined as the country-level damages, times vulnerability, and $v_{ij}$ is centered at 1:
> \[
> \log{v_{ji}} \sim \mathcal{N}(-\nicefrac{\tau_j^2}{2}, \tau_j^2)
> \]
> where $\tau_j$ is defined as the INFORM Risk 2023's index of vulnerable groups divided by 10. The vulnernable groups index is from 0 to 10, so the 99$^\text{th}$ percentile of vulnerability is 10 times the country-level average.
> 
> Finally, for either the vulnerability or income distributions to affect total damages, we assume lower-income individuals are more likely to have higher vulnerability. We define $\log{y_{ji}}$ and $\log{v_{ji}}$ as a multivariate normal with a correlation of -0.5.
> 
> Under power utility, the SCCO$_2$ under these subnational distributions is
> \begin{align*}
> \frac{\nicefrac{d W}{de}}{\nicefrac{\partial W}{\partial y}} &=
> \frac{\frac{d}{de}\int_v \int_y p_{vy} v u(y) dy dv}{\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \int_v \int_y p_{vy} u(y) dy dv} \\
>  &= \frac{\sum_i v_i \frac{d}{de} u(y)}{\sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial y} u(y)} \\
> &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_i v_i \left(\frac{y}{\bar{y}}\right)^{1 - \eta} \text{SCCO}_2 \\
> \end{align*}
> 
> We calculate $\frac{1}{N} \sum_i v_i \left(\frac{y}{\bar{y}}\right)^{1 - \eta}$ for each country. These are shown in the figure below:

> \subsection{Simulation Configuration}
> 
> For producing results on the country-level social cost of carbon, we use all of the improvements above. In particular:
> \begin{itemize}
> \item We use the RFF scenarios, and adjust the SSP emissions according to GDP growth changes as described above.
> \item We use the median pure rate of time preference and utility convexity from \citet{drupp2018discounting}, in our single-preference case (0.5\% and 1.0, respectively), and the distribution across experts in our preference-range case.
> \item We calculate an implicit carbon price necessary to reproduce the RFF scenarios, and adjust consumption based on these costs.
> \end{itemize}
> 
> We generate \num{10000} Monte Carlo runs from PAGE and compute SCCs for a pulse in the year 2020.
> 
> \subsection{Projected Hazards and Damages}
> 
> PAGE projects country-level temperature and global sea-level rise out to 2300. As shown in figure \ref{fig:temps}, global mean surface warming reaches about 3 $^\circ$C in 2100 and 3.5 $^\circ$C in 2300. All countries similarly level off. Country warming is generally higher than the global average, since land warms more quickly than the oceans.

>     \label{fig:temps}
> \end{figure}
> 
> Sea-level rise does not level off between 2100 and 2300, rising from \SI{1.4}{m} in 2100 to \SI{4.3}{m} in 2300 (see \ref{fig:slr}). There is considerable uncertainty in these projections, with the IQR between 3 and 5 m.

> 
> The resulting market damages, shown in \ref{fig:d_cons_mkt}, are dominated by the inverse-U-shaped relationship found by \citet{burke2015global}. The largest losses are  across the tropics (some over 10\% welfare-equivalent loss in 2100), with gains in high-latitude countries (some over 10\% gain).

> \end{figure}
> 
> Non-market damages, shown in \ref{fig:d_cons_non}, show the opposite pattern. These are driven by the total warming in each region, rather than final temperature, and temperate regions warm the fastest. Some temperate regions see losses equivalent to more than 15\% of their GDP.

> \subsection{Social Cost of Carbon}
> 
> The total global SCCs across all countries comes to \$219.75 / t CO2. This is close to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's new social cost of carbon estimate.
> 
> The SCCO$_2$ is described as a distribution, calculated using a set of Monte Carlo simulations. While the SCCO$_2$ considers damages globally, it is also possible to disaggregate this value, to represent the total damages from a ton of CO$_2$ emitted, for each country. This provides a summary statistic that synthesizes damages across time, accounting for future warming and economic growth.
> 
> The largest country-level SCC values occur in countries with the largest populations and income levels (see figure \ref{fig:scc-map}). This is driven by the significant role of GDP-based market damages.

> This section highlights the effects of different modeling choices, and particularly the effects of changing from a regional to a national model. For each modeling configuration, we report the distribution of the

> disaggreated national SCCO$_2$.
> 
> The parametric summary is motivated by a theoretical Kobb-Douglas

>              \label{eqn:sccpattern}
> \end{equation}
> 
> This approach decomposes the spatial distribution into a scaling with

That is $\alpha_1$, set to 0 for a GDP-based SCC, is set to 0.02 in Figure \ref{fig:sccmap-gen2} b; $\beta$, which is 1 for a GDP-based SCC, is set to 0.98 in Figure \ref{fig:sccmap-gen2} c; and $\gamma$, which is also 1 for a GDP-based SCC, is set to 0.95 in Figure \ref{fig:sccmap-gen2} d.

> 
> These results have significant policy implications, at both the global and domestic levels.
> 
> Globally, our results show that the near-term cost-benefit ratio for mitigation action is very strong. While strong mitigation action would eventually lower the SCC, seeking a point where costs equal benefits, it is clear that we are currently emitting significantly above that level. As a result, we incurring much more in damages than we are saving from avoided mitigation costs.
> 
> The maximum global benefits are found where marginal abatement costs equal the SCC, which represents marginal damages. In particular, economic theory suggests that countries should use their domestic mitigation costs for this goal, but use the global social cost of carbon. Anything less than this will be a net loss for all countries.
