**user**:
> I am writing a grant proposal titled NOWASTING (Nutrition Outcomes for
> West African Small-holders, Tracking Impacts on the Ground). For the executive summary, I have been asked to discuss:
> Give an overarching summary of the goals of the research networking project, with particular reference to the scientific quality of the consortium and of the proposed research, and the innovativeness of the approach. Describe the added value to be expected from the international collaboration with reference to the specific trans-disciplinarity, competence and expertise of the team and the complementarities of the consortium. Explain how users/societal actors have been engaged in the proposal and the potential impact of the research on society, policy, economy, etc.
> 
> I am particularly uncertaint about what include for the information on the consortium, which includes partners from my University of Delaware, Norway, Senegal, and Nigeria. How should I organize that?
**assistant**:
> Writing a compelling and effective executive summary for a grant proposal is key to capturing the attention of your evaluators. Here is how you can structure it:
> 
> **Title:** Nutrition Outcomes for West African Small-holders, Tracking Impacts on the Ground (NOWASTING)
> 
> **Summary of the Project's Goals:** 
> 
> Start with a concise description of the project and its primary objectives. Discuss the problems you want to address regarding nutrition outcomes for West African Small-holders and how the project intends to achieve these objectives. 
> 
> **Scientific Quality of The Consortium and Proposed Research:** 
> 
> Highlight the collective experience, qualifications, and diversity of the consortium. Discuss the academic excellence of the University of Delaware, Norway, Senegal, and Nigeria. Demonstrate the track record of the teams in terms of delivery of similar projects, pledges, or partnerships. Mention key individuals including their expertise and roles in the project.
> 
> Provide an overview of the research proposal, emphasizing its robustness, innovativeness, and relevance. Mention any cutting-edge techniques or frameworks that you'll use and explain how they guarantee high scientific quality outcomes. 
> 
> **The Innovativeness of the Approach:** 
> 
> Articulate your unique and innovative approach. This can include novel methodologies, perspective shifts, or integration of disciplines that will significantly contribute to the field.
> 
> **Added Value from International Collaboration:**
> 
> Discuss the benefits derived from the international nature of the consortium. Emphasize the diverse specialties, experiences, and resources that each partner brings, allowing for a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to the problem at hand. Highlight the benefits of having local partners in West Africa (Senegal and Nigeria)—these can include access to local knowledge and networks, increased understanding of the socio-cultural context, etc.
> 
> **Engagement of Users/Societal Actors and Potential Impact:** 
> 
> In this part, elaborate on the potential societal, policy, or economic impacts of your research. Discuss how your project can influence policy, address sustainable development goals, or contribute to economic growth. 
> 
> Describe how users or societal actors are involved in your proposal. For example, involve local farmers or farming associations in your research to ground your work into the realities on the ground.
> 
> Remember that clarity and brevity is key. Each section should be concise, yet informative, with a clear focus on the added value, innovative approach, and potential impact of the project.

> James Rising is an expert in the economics of climate change and in studying the interconnected humanand natural systems that affect and are affected by climate change and climate change policy. Hisresearch includes impacts on both health and the food system. He has studied the interactions betweenCOVID-19 spread globally, mortality risk from climate change, and nutrition outcomes from fi sheries.He has also studied adaptation in the food system, with projects on agriculture under climate change,water use and stress, and fi sheries management.

> Sensing for agricultural productivity. His educational qualifi cations include a PhD and MSc in RemoteSensing for agricultural productivity from the University of Manchester, United Kingdom. Dr. Adeluyi'score research focuses on utilizing advanced technologies such as Remote Sensing, GeographicInformation Systems (GIS), satellites, drones, and proximal sensing technologies to optimize riceproduction. Dr Adeluyi work involves developing and implementing innovative methodologies andalgorithms to monitor crop yield and yield indicators, specifi cally targeting rice production. During histenure as a consultant at Olam rice farm Nigeria, Dr. Adeluyi demonstrated his leadership skills bybuilding and leading a team of competent scientists. This team was equipped with the necessary skills toprocess and analyze satellite imagery, drone data, and proximal sensor data for rice yield monitoring.This demonstrates his practical experience in applying geospatial technologies in real-world agriculturalsettings. Dr. Adeluyi has also established collaborations with international organizations in Spain, theUK, and China.

The broad categories include health, housing,education, and criminal justice. The interdisciplinary nature of such policy puzzles has led to teamachievements that she does not claim as her own. Using tools of public policy and administration,econometrics, and community engagement as well as knowledge of political systems, she has workedwith government clients and community organizers at the national, state, and local levels. As aneducator, she has served in the classroom and in University-wide initiatives- taking on leadership roles asprogram coordinator, department chair, Honors College director, and currently serves as director of theHealth Policy and Management MPH program for the University of Delaware.

> My main area of expertise is food security and nutrition with focus on micronutrients in aquatic foods. Ihave extensive experience in dietary studies with seafood with special focus on the fi rst thousand days(pregnancy and infants), and development and validation of food frequency questionnaires withbiological marker. Uncertainties in food composition data is a challenge in nutrition monitoring, whichmay lead to incorrect results. I have therefore the last years focused on generating relevant, reliable andup-to-date nutrient composition data on small fi sh. Today, aquatic food makes up a small part of theworld?s food supply and is not well integrated in solving the goals to achieve ?zero hunger? (UN SDG2) and ?good health and well-being? (SDG3). Thus, my research focus on how SDG14 (Life belowwater) can contribute to better nutrition security in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia.

I have contributed to several chapters of theHandbook of Carbon Taxation for developing countries recently published by the United Nations. I haveserved as technical advisor to multilateral institutions, providing technical assistance to governmentsregarding electricity and water services to developing countries, and identifying reform options toimprove the services to the most vulnerable populations. I also assist developing countries in themanagement of their natural resources and its macroeconomic impact.
