> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."

> This statement describes my research, teaching, and service activities since finishing my PhD in 2015. In this time I was a post-doctoral fellow at University of California Berkeley for 9 months from 2015-2016 and since then have been an Assistant Professor at the University of California Davis. 
> Since finishing my PhD in September 2015 I have developed a research program that bridges climate science and environmental economics in order to better characterize and quantify the costs of climate change. I have published 18 peer reviewed journal articles since my PhD, including ones that have appeared in high-impact science journals (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Climate Change, Environmental Research Letters) and top agricultural and environmental economics journals (American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy) and successfully obtained grant funding from the National Science Foundation (one award of $750,000 as lead-PI, one of $2.8 million as co-PI). Recognition of my research accomplishments includes 28 invited talks at conferences or departmental seminars. My undergraduate and graduate teaching, across 5 different classes, focuses on building general skills in quantitative analysis and accessible, applied instruction in environmental policy analysis. I mentor graduate students in multiple graduate groups and have contributed to the establishment of a new graduate program in Environmental Policy and Management. I work to communicate my work on climate change costs to the public and policy makers through public speaking events, op-ed and policy brief writing, and consultation with federal agencies.

> This statement describes my research, teaching, and service activities since January 2018. During this period, I have held an Assistant Professorial Research Fellow position at the Gratham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics (2018 - 2020) and an Assistant Professor position at the School of Marine Science and Policy (SMSP), at the University of Delaware (2021 - present). I completed my Ph.D. in 2015 in Sustainable Development at Columbia University, advised by Dr. Upmanu Lall, and help post-doctoral positions at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. I continue to be engaged in research partnerships from these years, some of which resulted in publications and funded research prior to 2018, as reflected on my CV, but I focus here on accomplishments after my time as a post-doc.
> 
> I am an environmental economist and an interdisciplinary computational modeler, and I study how integrated economic-environmental systems function and how they can be better managed.  My research revolves around the impacts of climate change and spatiotemporal features of water-energy-food nexus. Both GRI and SMSP are interdisciplinary institutions, and I regularly collaborate with climate scientists, hydrologists, process-based modelers, data scientists, political economists, and macroeconomists, and my expertise allows me to contribute perspectives, expertise, and quantitative methods from multiple fields. I regularly translate my research to policy contexts, and my research, teaching, and service has intertwined in recent years.

> This statement outlines my research, teaching, and service activities beginning in January 2018. During this period, I have served as an Assistant Professorial Research Fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics (2018 - 2020). Subsequently, I assumed the position of an Assistant Professor at the School of Marine Science and Policy (SMSP), at the University of Delaware (2021 - present). I received my Ph.D. in 2015 in Sustainable Development from Columbia University where I benefited from Dr. Upmanu Lall's guidance. Post-doctoral stints at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago further extended my sphere of learning. Over the years, I have maintained an active engagement in research partnerships which yielded several peer-reviews publications and funded research. However, for the purpose of this statement, I will focus on achievements accomplished after my post-doctoral term.

> Being an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational modeler gives me a unique perspective on understanding and managing complex economic-environmental systems. My primary research revolves around analyzing the impacts of climate change and the spatiotemporal relationships in the water-energy-food nexus. Working at interdisciplinary institutes like SMSP and GRI has given me the opportunity to collaborate with experts from a broad array of disciplines. Together, our combined expertise contributes towards a multi-faceted approach for exploring our subjects of interest. My work often translates into policy contexts, an attribute that has blurred the lines between research, teaching, and service in recent years.
