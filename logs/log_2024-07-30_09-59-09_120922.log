**user**:
> I have a new QNAP NAS, and I've previously worked to mount it on my linux box. I see in /mnt a /qnap_shares directory, but it's read-only. How can I write things to the NAS as a mounted directory?
**assistant**:
> To mount your QNAP NAS as a writable directory in Linux, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Firstly, you need to identify the NAS server's IP address and the share name that you want to mount. 
> 
> 2. Make sure to install necessary tools by running: 
> 
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install nfs-common
> ```
> 
> 3. Now create a directory in /mnt where you want to mount your NAS shares:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo mkdir /mnt/qnap_shares
> ```
> 
> 4. You need to edit the /etc/fstab file to add a new line for the network share mount. This can be done with any text editor, for example nano:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo nano /etc/fstab
> ```
> 
> Add a line that looks something like this at the bottom:
> 
> ```bash
> <ip-address-of-NAS>:/<share-name> /mnt/qnap_shares nfs auto,nofail,noatime,nolock,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800 0 0
> ```
> 
> To have write access, your user needs to have the same user ID on both the client (your Linux box) and the NFS server (QNAP). If the user IDs do not match, you can add `nfsvers=3,uid=1000,gid=1000` to the options above if your local user id and group id are 1000.
> 
> 5. After you have added the line, you can test the mounting works by typing:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo mount -a
> ```
> 
> 6. Check if the NAS is mounted:
> 
> ```bash
> df -h
> ```
> 
> In the mounted filesystem list, you should see your QNAP shares with their respective filesystem paths.
> 
> Remember to replace `<ip-address-of-NAS>` and `<share-name>` with your NAS IP address and the share's name. 
> 
> Please note that changes to /etc/fstab will take effect at next system boot, so these shares will be reconnected automatically. But, incorrect settings in /etc/fstab can cause the system to become unbootable. Be cautious while editing this file.
> 
> Lastly, it's essential to ensure that export permissions on your NAS allow for read/write access. You may need to adjust these settings on your QNAP Web Interface as appropriate.
**user**:
> How do I find the IP address of the QNAP server? I log into its web interface at http://10.2.74.57:8080/cgi-bin/. Is that going to be the same IP?
**assistant**:
> If you access your QNAP NAS through the URL http://10.2.74.57:8080/cgi-bin/ when you log into its web interface, then most likely the IP address 10.2.74.57 is the IP address of your QNAP server.
> 
> To confirm the IP address of your QNAP server, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Log in to your QNAP NAS web interface using the URL you provided: http://10.2.74.57:8080/cgi-bin/
> 
> 2. Once logged in, look for network settings or network configuration options in the QNAP NAS web interface. The specific location may vary depending on the QNAP firmware version, but you are likely to find this information under a section related to network settings, network configuration, or LAN settings.
> 
> 3. In the network settings, you should be able to find the IP address assigned to your QNAP server. This IP address is the one you should use to mount the QNAP shares on your Linux box.
> 
> Alternatively, you can also find the IP address of your QNAP server by checking your router's DHCP client list. Most routers list the devices connected to the network along with their assigned IP addresses. Look for the QNAP device in the list to find its IP address.
> 
> Once you have confirmed the IP address of your QNAP server, you can use this IP address to mount the QNAP shares on your Linux box as explained in the previous response.
**user**:
> sudo apt-get install nsf-common says it's unable to locate the package, and mount -a says that mount.nsf is not supported.
**assistant**:
> I apologize for the confusion. It appears that there was a typographical error in the package name provided earlier. The correct package name should be `nfs-common` instead of `nsf-common`.
> 
> To install the NFS common package on your Linux system, you can use the following command:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install nfs-common
> ```
> 
> Once you have installed `nfs-common`, you can proceed with mounting your QNAP NAS shares on your Linux box. 
> 
> Regarding the `mount.nfs` error, it seems like there might have been a misunderstanding. When you use `sudo mount -a`, it should attempt to mount all filesystems listed in `/etc/fstab`, including NFS mounts. The error message you received about `mount.nfs` not being supported typically means that the `mount` command couldn't find the specific `mount.nfs` command, which is expected behavior.
> 
> After installing `nfs-common`, you can proceed with adding the NFS mount entry to `/etc/fstab` as outlined in the previous response, making sure to use the correct IP address and share name for your QNAP NAS. Once you update `/etc/fstab`, you can run `sudo mount -a` to attempt the mount.
> 
> If you encounter any further issues or have more questions, please let me know so I can assist you accordingly.
**user**:
> The package installed, but I still get the error:
> mount.nfs: Protocol not supported
**assistant**:
> If you are encountering the error "mount.nfs: Protocol not supported" when attempting to mount your QNAP NAS shares on your Linux system, it could be due to the NFS version mismatch between your Linux system and the QNAP NAS.
> 
> To resolve this issue, you can specify the NFS version explicitly in the `/etc/fstab` file when defining the mount options. You can specify the NFS version by adding `nfsvers=3` or `nfsvers=4` to the mount options, depending on which NFS version your QNAP NAS supports.
> 
> Here is the updated step-by-step guide to mount your QNAP NAS shares with the NFS version specified:
> 
> 1. Update your `/etc/fstab` file with the appropriate NFS version option. For example:
> 
> ```bash
> <ip-address-of-NAS>:/<share-name> /mnt/qnap_shares nfs nfsvers=3,rw,auto,user 0 0
> ```
> 
> Replace `<ip-address-of-NAS>` and `<share-name>` with the actual IP address of your QNAP server and the share name you want to mount.
> 
> 2. Save the `/etc/fstab` file after making the necessary changes.
> 
> 3. After updating the `/etc/fstab` file, you can remount the filesystems by running:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo mount -a
> ```
> 
> This command will attempt to mount all filesystems listed in `/etc/fstab`, including the QNAP NAS share with the specified NFS version.
> 
> By specifying the NFS version in the mount options, you ensure that the NFS protocol version used during the mount operation matches the one supported by your QNAP NAS.
> 
> If your QNAP NAS supports a different NFS version than 3, you can adjust the `nfsvers` option accordingly (e.g., `nfsvers=4`).

**user**:
> Okay, progress! Now I get the error:
> mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting 10.2.74.57:/OpenData/Public
> 
> My folder is called Public on a storage volume OpenData. I also tried dropping the /OpenData part and it gives the same error but for 10.2.74.57:/Public.
**assistant**:
> The "access denied by server" error message typically indicates that there is a permission issue on the NFS server side (in this case, your QNAP NAS) that is preventing your Linux system from mounting the NFS share. To resolve this issue, you need to adjust the NFS share settings on your QNAP NAS to allow the Linux client to access the share.
> 
> Here are the steps to troubleshoot and resolve the "access denied by server" error:
> 
> 1. **Check NFS Share Permissions on QNAP NAS**:
>    - Access your QNAP NAS web interface.
>    - Navigate to the NFS share settings or NFS configuration section.
>    - Ensure that the NFS share you are trying to mount (`OpenData/Public` or `Public`) is configured with appropriate permissions to allow access from your Linux client. Make sure that the NFS share allows the IP address of your Linux client to access it.
> 
> 2. **Adjust NFS Share Settings**:
>    - Ensure that the NFS share is configured to allow the specific IP address of your Linux client to access it.
>    - If there are options for host-based access control in the QNAP NAS settings, you may need to add the IP address of your Linux client to the allowed hosts for the NFS share.
> 
> 3. **Restart NFS Services**:
>    - After making changes to the NFS share settings on your QNAP NAS, restart the NFS services on the NAS to apply the changes.
> 
> 4. **Mount the NFS Share**:
>    - Update the `/etc/fstab` file on your Linux system with the correct NFS share configuration (including the correct IP address, share name, and NFS version).
>    - Restart the NFS services on your Linux system or remount the NFS shares using `sudo mount -a`.
> 
> 5. **Test the Mount**:
>    - Try to mount the NFS share from your QNAP NAS on your Linux system again. Use the mount command you've updated in `/etc/fstab`.
>    - If successful, you should be able to access the NFS share and write to it from your Linux system.
> 
> By ensuring that the NFS share on your QNAP NAS is properly configured with the correct permissions and access settings, you should be able to resolve the "access denied by server" error and successfully mount the NFS share on your Linux system.
>
