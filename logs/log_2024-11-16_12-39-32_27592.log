> Dear Dr. James Rising,
> 
> I hope all is well. I’m wondering if we might be able to collaborate on a COVID-19 project which I am working on together with the European Society of Medicine.
> 
> Your work on “Weather drives variation in COVID-19 transmission and detection” caught my attention and I thought that it was a rather insightful article. Are you still working in this area?
> 
> I was thinking that your work would fit well into a special theme issue on COVID-19 which I am organizing, and that maybe you would be interested in writing a new article for the theme issue.
> 
> The issue will be published in the official journal of the European Society of Medicine, near the beginning of next year.
> 
>  
> 
> Would you be willing to explore this idea?
