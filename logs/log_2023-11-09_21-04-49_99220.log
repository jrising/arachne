**user**:
> What would be an appropriate JEL code for Environmental Justice?
**assistant**:
> The Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) codes provide a hierarchical system for classifying academic literature in the field of economics. The code which regards environmental issues is "Q", and specifically "Q5" for Environmental Economics. 
> 
> Given the interconnection between environmental issues and social justice, the most relevant JEL code for Environmental Justice could be "Q56" - Environment and Development; Environment and Trade; Sustainability; Environmental Accounts and Accounting; Environmental Equity; Population Growth. 
> 
> In addition to that, one could consider using "D63" - Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement, under Microeconomics, to emphasize the justice aspect of the topic. 
> 
> Please keep in mind that JEL codes aren't exclusive, and multiple codes can be used to indicate the different dimensions of your work.
