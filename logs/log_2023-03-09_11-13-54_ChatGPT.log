**assistant**:
> InstructGPT is a proprietary language model developed by OpenAI, and as far as I'm aware, there is no open access version of this model available to the public. 
> 
> However, OpenAI does provide access to some of its language models through its API, including the GPT-3 model. Depending on your intended use case, you may be able to use GPT-3 instead of InstructGPT. You can apply for access to the OpenAI API on their website.
> 
> Alternatively, there are several open source language models available that you may be able to use for your project, such as GPT-2, RoBERTa, and BERT. These models may not be as powerful as InstructGPT or GPT-3, but they can still be useful for many natural language processing tasks.
