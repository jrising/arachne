> 
> 1. Arachne: In one of the more famous stories, a mortal woman named Arachne claimed to be a better weaver than Athena herself. The goddess challenged Arachne to a weaving contest, where Arachne's work depicted the gods' faults and mistakes. Athena was enraged by the disrespectful tapestry and the challenge to her skills, and turned Arachne into a spider as punishment, hence the origin of arachnids.
> 
> 2. Medusa: While the details of this myth can vary, it's said that Medusa was once a beautiful woman who boasted about her beauty or desecrated Athena's temple. In one version of the story, she was violated by Poseidon in Athena's temple. Regardless of the reason, Athena was angered and cursed Medusa by turning her hair into snakes and making her face so terrible that any who looked at her would turn to stone.
> 
> 3. Pandora: Athena played a part in the story of Pandora, the first woman created by the gods. Athena taught Pandora the skills of weaving and dressed her in a silver gown.
> 
> 4. Penelope: In the Odyssey, Athena assists Penelope, the wife of Odysseus, by offering her wisdom and guidance during her husband's long absence, and by helping her devise the contest of the bow to discover the suitor worthy of Odysseus' position.
> 
> 5. Helen of Troy: According to some accounts, Athena assisted Helen during the Trojan War. When Paris, a prince of Troy, had to choose the fairest goddess between Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena, he chose Aphrodite. This led to Athena taking the side of the Greeks in the Trojan War and supporting Helen's original husband Menelaus.
> 
> 6. Nike: While not a mortal woman, Nike was a goddess and was often associated with Athena as a symbol of victory in both war and peaceful competition. Nike is frequently portrayed together with Athena in sculptures and on ancient Greek coins.
> 
> 7. Metis: Metis, the titaness of wisdom and deep thought, was Athena's mother. According to the myth, Zeus, fearing that Metis would bear a son mightier than himself, swallowed her while she was pregnant. Athena was then born, fully grown and armored, from Zeus's forehead.

> In various Greek myths, Athena has been known to take on different forms or disguises, including those of mortal humans, to interact with or guide mortals. However, when she does this, she is typically not identified by a different name, but later revealed to be Athena. Here are a couple of examples:
>

> 
> 2. Mentes: Also in the Odyssey, Athena takes on the guise of Mentes, a Taphian chief, to encourage Telemachus to go on a voyage to find out about his father.
> 
> 3. Various disguises in The Iliad: In the Iliad, Athena takes on various disguises to intervene in the Trojan War, appearing as different warriors or other characters. For instance, in Book 5, she takes the form of Deiphobus to trick Hector into fighting Achilles.
> 
> While Athena does take on the form of different characters in these stories, she does not truly become human nor does she change her divine nature. She merely appears to be someone else as a means of disguise.
