**user**:
> I would like to button on a webpage that uses jquery that causes a textarea to slidedown into view, or slideup out of view (so, toggles its visibility this way). Is there a nice way for this to look-- like with a Title ("Context" would by my title) followed by a triangle symbol which flips down and back to the right on click?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! First, let us craft the HTML structure. We will need a button for interaction and a textarea which will slide down and slide up upon clicks on the button.
> 
> ```html
> <div id="buttonContainer">
>   <h2>Context <span id="arrow">&#x25B2;</span></h2>
> </div>
> 
> <textarea id="contextArea" style="display: none;">
>   Enter your context here.
> </textarea>
> ```
> 
> In the above HTML code, the rightwards-facing arrow 'â–¶' (character `&#x25B2;`) will serve as our arrow. 
> 
> Now, we can use jQuery's slidetoggle for the functionality, and some simple manipulation to adjust arrow orientation. Make sure to include the appropriate jQuery library in your HTML.
> 
> ```javascript
> $(document).ready(function() {
>    $('#buttonContainer').click(function() {
>      $('#contextArea').slideToggle('slow', function() {
>        if ($('#contextArea').is(':visible')) {
>          $('#arrow').html('&#x25BC;');
>        } else {
>          $('#arrow').html('&#x25B2;');
>        }
>      });
>    });
> });
> ```
> 
> In this jQuery code, we are setting a click event on `#buttonContainer`. It triggers the `slideToggle()` method which will either slide down or slide up the `#contextArea`. The `is(':visible')` condition checks if the textarea is visible or not, and based on the condition, it changes the arrow HTML. 
> 
> Remember to include the relevant CSS to ensure your title and arrow align nicely. Here's an example of what you might use:
> 
> ```css
> #buttonContainer {
>   cursor: pointer;
> }
> 
> #buttonContainer span {
>   float: right;
> }
> ```
> 
> This will help us to use cursor as pointer when we hover over the context and the arrow will float on the right side of the title. 
> 
> Please modify this as per your webpage CSS, need and requirement.
