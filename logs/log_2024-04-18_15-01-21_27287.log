> to:
> Good evening Dr. Rising:
> 
> Could you please advise me on PhD programs involving marine resources including your own at University of Delaware?
> 
> I want to pursue a PhD through which I can research topics such as fish populations and markets as well as that of other aquatic life. I'm also interested in water quality and accessibility (primarily concerns related to mercury and recreational drugs).
> 
> Between these passions of mine and my B.A. in economics, I think it's best I apply to a program such as Environmental Economics at University of Delaware.
> 
> I already have some research experience:
> 
> 1. Independent Research course: Impact of Immigration on U.S. House Prices
> 2. Economics of Environment and Natural Resources group project: Economics of Overfishing (I focused on Bangladesh)
> 3. Public Finance course paper: Towards Solutions to the U.S. Debt Crisis
> 
> Even though my independent project focused on immigration, I want to dive deeper into the economics of fishing and related topics as mentioned above - having gone through your profile, I think you're one of the best people to assist and teach me considering your own experience in mapping out the distribution of fish larvae.
> 
> However, I struggled greatly in undergrad because I had a difficult past due to moving around the U.S. at least six times before I even reached 15 years of age while growing up in an immigrant household. This made it challenging for me to develop myself as a student in high school and college resulting in a 2.1 undergrad GPA.
> 
> Because of this, I decided to delay graduate school by gaining some professional experience and gauging what exactly I want to accomplish in my life; as such, I spent the last four years or so working as a load forecast specialist in the electric utilities industry.
> 
> This position required me to develop multiple linear regression analysis on load and weather data that I retrieved and organized.
> 
> This and the research I performed in undergrad helped me develop my econometrics skills as I applied them to real-world scenarios.
> 
> Now, I feel that it's finally time for me to go back to school and advance in my education.
> 
> With that said, I understand that my undergrad gpa may still be a concern, which is why I'm planning to take multivariate calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, real analysis, and possibly more courses starting this summer to prove my growth and ability to do well in a program like that at University of Delaware.
> 
> I also realize that I may need to go for a masters to prove that I can handle graduate level studies, in which case, I hope to  pursue the M.S. at your department.
> 
> In light of this, I understand that some programs admit students on a conditional or provisional basis, which I would be happy to consider.
> 
> Please let me know what you think. My phone number is (610)223-3107. I hope to hear from you soon.
> 
> Thank you,
> Fattah M. Arif
> 
> Please draft for me an email response to the following email or email
> thread. The email will come from me. Please keep the text
> professional, dispassionate, and to-the-point.
> 
> If a time to chat by zoom is in order, ask the person to find a time
> at https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0.
> 
> Below is very brief notes on what should be included in the response.
> Thank for reaching out. Be supportive. UD's EE program could be a good fit.
> GPA would be a problem. Most recent school work makes is most important. Will you get a transcript?

> Dear Fattah,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your journey so far; I appreciate your determination and resilience. You certainly have a strong interest in marine resources and the application of economic principles to environmental issues, which aligns well with the Environmental Economics program here at the University of Delaware.
> 
> Your professional experience, coupled with your research skills, have clearly prepared you for higher-level study. The first-hand usage of econometrics you've described is particularly noteworthy, as it is very close to the kind of work you would undertake in a graduate program in our field.
> 
> Regarding your GPA, I appreciate your candor. Given that your GPA is from a few years ago, decisions about your acceptance would be influenced greatly by your recent and upcoming academic performance. The additional classes you're planning to take are an excellent idea and will unquestionably demonstrate your capability and dedication. 
> 
> One aspect you might want to consider is obtaining a transcript from the learning institution where you're taking these additional courses. This may be particularly useful for demonstrating your most recent academic performance and counterbalancing the lower GPA from your undergraduate studies.
> 
> Regarding your idea of pursuing a Master's program first, that is indeed one strategy students use to prepare for a PhD program and show they can handle the rigor of graduate-level studies. However, every path is unique and the best course of action will depend on a range of factors specific to your situation.
> 
> I'd be glad to discuss this with you further. Please feel free to schedule a call with me at a time that suits you via this [link](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0) to my calendar.
> 
> Thank you again for considering the University of Delaware, and I look forward to further discussing your path towards pursuing advanced studies in Environmental Economics.
> 
> Best regards,
