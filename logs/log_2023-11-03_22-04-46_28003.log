**user**:
> I am producing results on the current losses from climate change. In one graph, I show all countries as a spray of lines, but I would like to highlight a subset of countries (maybe 8-12) with bolder, colored lines. These should be representative of different regions, but also some of the most important countries in terms of economics or their role in the UNFCCC negotiations. Can you suggest a set of countries to use?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James. It would be useful to include major economies, high-emitting countries, countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change, and countries known for their leadership or unique perspectives in UNFCCC negotiations. Here's a suggested list:
> 
> 1. **United States**: As one of the world's largest economies and historically, the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. plays a key role in UNFCCC negotiations.
> 
> 2. **China**: The world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases currently and a rapidly growing economy, China's stance on climate change is crucial.
> 
> 3. **India**: As a rapidly industrializing country with a large population, India's future emissions trajectory will be significant in global outcomes.
> 
> 4. **European Union (EU)**: The EU has frequently played a leadership role in the international climate change policy.
> 
> 5. **Russia**: Russia is a major emitter and its economy is heavily tied to fossil fuel production and export.
> 
> 6. **Brazil**: Home to the Amazon Rainforest, Brazil is a pivotal country in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through forest conservation. 
> 
> 7. **Australia**: As a major coal exporter and country already feeling severe impacts from climate change (bushfires, heatwaves), Australia's role is important to highlight.
> 
> 8. **Maldives**: A country highly vulnerable to sea-level rise, Maldives has played a significant role in representing Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in UNFCCC negotiations.
> 
> 9. **Nigeria**: Represents the African group that is economically and geographically diverse and is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
> 
> 10. **Saudi Arabia**: As one of the world's leading oil producers, Saudi Arabia often represents fossil fuel exporting countries in negotiations.
> 
> 11. **Canada**: This country balances a large fossil fuel sector with aggressive national climate ambitions.
> 
> This list aims to balance geographical representation, economic wealth and development, climate vulnerability, and importance in climate negotiations.
**user**:
> What are the ISO codes for each of these?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, here are the ISO codes for the countries I mentioned:
> 
> 1. United States: **USA**
> 2. China: **CHN**
> 3. India: **IND**
> 4. European Union (EU): **EU**
> 5. Russia: **RUS**
> 6. Brazil: **BRA**
> 7. Australia: **AUS**
> 8. Maldives: **MDV**
> 9. Nigeria: **NGA**
> 10. Saudi Arabia: **SAU**
> 11. Canada: **CAN**
> 
> These ISO codes are widely used and recognized for identifying countries in various systems and databases.
