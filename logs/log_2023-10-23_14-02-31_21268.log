> Terminology notes
> An elaborate, often cute, terminology hasdeveloped around regime shifts, recruitment variation, and their relationships to fish biology and behavior. Andrew Bakun (2010), who has coined some ofthese terms, considers them to represent hypotheses that have recurring application in understand- ing stock changes and species interactions in marine fisher-
> ies ecology. For example, we have defined wasp-waisted ecosystems sufficiently above. B a k u ncalls these terms "con- ceptual templates" and "schematic constructs"(which turn out to be the same thing), basically a tool kit of hypotheses that may (or may not) be adjusted to fit a specific situation. Here are some more that are in current use.
> Match-mismatch (David Cushing) refers to the necessity for strong recruitment that spawningof a stock and devel- opment of its larval feedingrequirements match the timing of food producing events. For cod that might be a match (or not) of their hatching with spawning of Calanus to provide the larvae with early and abundant nauplii to eat. Critical periods for finding food before starvation are a related conceptual template, one making matches (as opposed to mismatches) a survival necessity.
> Those two concepts are closely similar to Lasker windows. Reuben L a k e r emphasized the need for larvae to find sufficient food and associated that with the need for strong vertical layering of zooplankton prey. Finding
> suitable concentrations would be a "window" to growth beyond the prey sizes of planktonic predators, to juvenile status and to mobility. L a k e r coupled this to the impor- tance of ocean stratificationso that layers of prey f o rlarvae w o u l dnot be disturbed in the larva'scriticalperiod.
> Connectivity (Michael Sinclair and others) - egg and larval drift must connect planktonic young with suitable locations for juvenile development. As detailed above for the term "hydrographic containment", spawning sites become selected as places usually providing t h a tconnectiv- ity. It can fail if currents are unusual (another s o r tof match- mismatchrequirement).This relates to oceantriads, Bakun's notion that large stocks can develop in areas where: (i) the ocean is enriched (upwelling, mixing, iron available, etc.), (ii) concentrations are sustained (convergences, fronts, etc.), and (iii) flow connects larvac to juvenile habitat.
> P2P loop (Bakun) - "prey to predator" reversed interac- tion. The notion is that in marine ecosystems forage fish can prey heavily o nthe eggs and larvae of their predators (e.g. cod, hake, bluefish,...), thus protecting themselves because those potential predators do not grow up. Bakun suggests, for example, that the recently booming herring stocks in the northwest Atlantic may be eating cod spawn, slowing cod stock recovery, sustaining their own peak abundance. Quantifying the importance of P2P can be difficult.
> Loopholes (Bakun and Kenneth Broad) - places where predation on eggs or larvae is low enough to overcome their disadvantages as habitat. Bakun and Broad (2003) give the example of tuna spawning in regionsof minimal pro- duction relative to the rest of their adult range, possibly to lower the predation threat to larvae. Emphasis on not being eaten can be as important as eating well.
> Predator pits (Bakun) - at low density, of say a forage fish, its predators will ignore it and survival will be high. To reach high density, the stock mustcross a level of abundance
> Chapter 17
> 
>  Fisheries oceanography
> 42il
> (a lowlevel, but not the lowest possible, the "pit") in which it is controlled by its attentive predators. If good conditions allow a breakout above the "critical point" at which preda- tion becomes saturated, then the population can have low per capita mortality and reach very high abundance.
> School trap (Bakun, again) - a far from dominant species of fish may school with the dominant species, tolerating food or other conditions less than ideal for it, in order to obtain the predator avoidance benefits of large schools. This reduces its potential for increase in one respect, pro- tecting it in another. Mixed schools have been widely observed. Schooling tendency can be strong enough that huge schoolscannot act effectively to search the habitat for food (they are "trapped"). Maybe. Bakun modifies this as the school-mix feedback loop - dominant fish with inap- propriate behavior (say some genotype) can lead whole schools to destruction. Maybe.
> Optimal stability window (Ann Gargett) - another window. The general suggestion has been taken from Gargett's (e.g. 1997) notion that an intermediate level of turbulence provides ideal biologicalconditions. Intermediate wind speeds, wave activity and vertical mixing rates are likely to provide the best conditions for survival.
> In addition, a numberof explanatory notions have been adopted in fisheries from general ecological terminology; these are also attempts to generate conceptual templates. Aportfolio effect (coined by Frank Figge) has been claimed by Schindler et al. (2010) for lake-spawning sockeye salmon. The variability of the overall stock returning to
> Bristol Bay, Alaska, is much less that those of the individual
> runs to different lakes. Like a stock-investment portfolio,
> diversification of subpopulation behavior provides some
> stabilityt o the overall system. Others are the"rivet hypoth-
> esis" - loss or sharp decline in one or a few species ("rivets"
> in the ecosystem structure) can cause general breakdown; and functional combensation - more than one species
> provides each function in the habitat, and reduction of one can be compensated by others, with redundancy pro-
> viding stability (the opposite of the popping rivet notion). Like physicists naming quarks, gluons, and charm, fisheries ecologists will continue to coin suggestive (and cute) terminology.
> Status of world fisheries
> The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the world's central data-gathering authority for fisheries. Each year they produce the FAO Fisheries Yearbook, an elaborate statistical summary including data from several years prior to 2 years before publication. The FAO has websites with the majority of their recent graphs and charts. A current review of world fisheries can be found by searching under fisheries at the following site: http:// www.fao.org/.
> Basic recent capture fisheries data, as well as inland fisheries and aquaculture production figures,can be found by following links at: http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/ en ("en" for English, also available in French and Spanish)
> Use of the data files may requiredownloading and instal-
> lation of the FAO "Fishstat" software. Some of the more
> general tables are also available on the worldwide web:

> You should check these sources in addition to the sum-
> maries below, since it is best to inform yourself about the status of fisheries with up-to-date results. Even data for years well past are often updated as new reports are received at the FAO from fisheries agencies around the world. For a second opinion on global fisheries status, see Garcia and
> Rosenberg (2010).
> We (the people fish harder and harder all the time.
> Whether or not the overall fishery production of the oceans is sustainable remains to be seen (Box 17.1). In about 1973 total production of all marine fisheries stopped increasing at thedramatic quasi-exponential rate, about 6% per year, which had persisted since World War II (Plate 17.1). The last phase of growth at that rate was sustained by develop- ment of the Peruvian anchoveta fishery, which peaked around 12 Mt. This temporary ceiling was reached in the 1970s with surprising suddenness as the Peruvian ancho-
> veta fishery crashed in 1972. For a time after 1973, the world total stayed close to 65 Mt live weight, perhaps increasing at an unsteady 1% per year. Continued growth of demersal (near-bottom) fisheries held the total up during the 1970s. This latter phase was accompanied by substan- tial investment in large, world-ranging trawlers. However, that came to an endi n 1978 as theindustrialfishing nations (most importantlyJapan and the USSR) stretched the world demersal resources to their limit.
> Them in the mid-1980s came a series of recurring increases. The trawling industry remained in place and output held steady for a time. Initially, the burst of the mid- 1980s was in the top few species: Alaskan pollock, Japanese sardine, capelin, and Chilean jack mackerel. Several of these species, particularly the clupeids, had dramatic increases after the Pacific regime shift of 1976. It was warmer, and production was definitely greater in these stocks. Some fisheries responded immediately (Japan, Chile), while others (herring off New England, the California sardine) did not have the markets to drive a return to intensive harvests. Chilean fisheries took much of the mid-1980s increase, and Chile was the No. 4, even No. 3, fishing nation in those years. T h a t was from fishing on sardine and mackerel stocks, plus fishing along its southern coast on a variety of species. In the 1990s, the Peruvian anchoveta fishery returned to over 9 Mt yr', in 1995 12Mt, which covered some declines in demersal stock production worldwide, actually raising the world total and leading to 1996-1997 marine-capture fishery totals over 86 Mt. Those were the highest totals to date. Total yield dipped in 1998 to about

>  Box 17.1 Potential fishery production
> Several workers (Ryther 1969; Pauly & Christensen 1995) have supposed that it should be possible to predict the rate at which fisheries can remove biomass from the
> sea by combining a global estimate of primary produc- tion with a simple ecological calculation. They approxi- mate the trophic level (T) of "fish" taken by fisheries, apply a general ecological efficiency at each food-chain step leading to T; take account of the need to leave much new biomass in the ocean to support the health and reproduction of stocks; then provide a finalestimate by appropriate multiplications. Current estimates of global primary production are approximately 44 GtC per year (Behrenfeld & Falkowski 1997). More productive
> coastal areas might be roughly 10% of ocean area, but they produce about 50% of fishery output. They also have relatively short food chains with much fishery pro- duction from the third and fourth trophic levels, so perhaps T = 3.5. The remaining seas are more oligo- trophic, and food chains are longer, with fishery produc- tion at perhaps T = 5.5.
> Ecological efficiency, EE, the fraction of its produc- tion that one tropic level transfers on average to its predators, is in fact extremely difficult to estimate. Of course, the value is constrained: it cannot be zero, and it cannot be greater than typical lifetime growth effi- ciency, that is, (tissue formed)/(food eaten). For many marine animals, growth efficiency is quite high, espe- cially for juveniles, perhaps 30%. Ecological efficiencies are less, since only transfers "upward" to higher-order predators count, not "losses" to the decomposertrophic level. So, like Ryther and all other practitioners of these predictions, let us guess. As a start, let EE = 20%.
> Expressing the model as an equation and leaving two- thirds of production for stock maintenance (not a strongly prudent number, actually), we have:
> Potential catch = 0.33 (44 GtC (O.SEE3.5 +0.SEES.51) = 0.027 GtC.
> This must be converted from carbon to "fish". Using reasonable, approximate factors (carbon/dry weight = 0.4, dry weight/wet weight = 0.3), we have:
> Potential catch = 0.027 GtC/(0.3 x 0.4) = 0.227 Gt wet weight.

> And, finally, this must be converted to millions of metric tonnes (Mt):
> Potential catch = 0.227 x 103 Mt/Gt = 227 Mt
> That is about double the global catch, including discarded bycatch. It is of importance that the world fishery take is of the same order of magnitude as this outcome, whatever its associated uncertainty. It defi- nitely implies that removal of biomass by us, "the people", is a very large factor in marine ecology at higher trophic levels.
> If you examine the equation, you will see that it is exquisitely sensitive t othe valuechosen for EE, a value we must guess. Putting potential catch at current catch, about 125 Mt, and solving for EE (iteratively or by logs), gives 17%, by no means an unlikely mean value for the oceans, given the state of current knowledgeof trophic ecology. Of course, t h ecalculation i salso sensi- tive to the trophic level chosen as representative for fishery production, the proportions assignedto coastal and oceanic production, and the accuracy of the grand sum of primary production. You should explore this yourself.
> If limitation of potential catch to one-third of pro-
> duction is eliminated, and E is reduced to 10%, the supposed potential is only 19 Mt, less than 20% of actual. This all but proves that EE around 10%, which was assumed by ecologists a generation ago a sstandard, and which is still taught in elementary ecology courses, must be too low for at least the oceans.
> We may very well be fishing accessible resources as intensely as the stocks can bear, or more intensely in the long term, even if the apparent potential catch is double the actual catch. Accessibility is the issue. Unexploited squid and krill alone represent enough productivity to account for the difference. Other production at the trophic levels of fishery stocks appears in little-exploited jellyfish, in mid-water fishes, and in widespread oceanic stocks not possible to exploitcommercially. Thus, the calculation, along with the recently flat catch totals and other considerations, suggests that we are pushing close to the oceans' potential to produce fish for human use.

Earlier, Communist Bloc fishingwas inefficient from an economic standpoint. World totals were not greatly reduced by reduction in Eastern Bloc harvesting. The gap

> was filled by return of the Peruvians to exploitation of the anchoveta. Since 2000, annual capture fisheries totals have
> been 80 to 84 Mt, consistently led by anchoveta ranging from 7 to 10.7 Mt and Alaskan pollock at 2.7 to 2.9 Mt (latest complete data are for 2008).
> In addition to capture fisheries, coastal waters around the world now host substantial mariculture operations (dis- tinct from aquaculture operations in freshwater). Important products are salmon (mostly in Norway and Canada), mol- lusks (mussels, oysters, clams, and scallops) and shrimp. These activities produced over 12 Mt of these products in 1999 and 19.7 Mt in 2008. Note that FAO reports whole weight of mollusks, including shells, and most shells end up in piles near the shore, not inside diners. Aquaculture has grown even more, from 18.4 Mt in 1999 to 32.9 Mt in 2008. In both cases, and marine-capture landings as well, there has been doubt about totals reported by the Chinese based on the special value of over-reporting in their accounting system (e.g. Brander 2007). That is not accounted for here.
> Many fishing operations do not bring to port all that they catch. Captured fish and invertebrates other than the species targeted by a fishing operation are termed "bycatch". Some bycatch is valuable enough to return to port, so is included in t h ecatch totals. But much bycatch has no acces- sible market, is made up of species closed to fishing by regulations, or just has no commercial value. Fishers shovel that part, most of it killed or injured by the gear and hauling aboard, back into the ocean. Discarded bycatch is a major component of the mortality imposed by fisherieson marine populations. Alverson et al. (1994) used observer estimates to' calculate a likely world total in 1992 of 27 Mt, or about a third of the FAO landings estimate for that year. Discarded bycatch probably has been about that proportion of land- ings for a long time (assumed to show the bycatch impact in Plate 17.1), amounts greater than the total clupeid landings.

> The capacityof commercial fishery interests to push the total catchupward has been astounding. So far as we know, few new resources exist that might beexploited to increase
> fishery production. However, it does not pay to say that a ceiling has been reached; leave it to the Japanese fishing masters to find more edible stocks. Mid-water squid popu- lations might be a resource with some potential, if efficient

> gear. Returns to trawling at depth are not large enough to
> make it economical. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a resource with potential to produce 50 to 200 Mt per year, and the Japanese, West Germans, and Eastern Bloc nations tried for a while to develop that fishery. However, a decade of research and preliminary commercial development brought the 1982 catch to 0.53 Mt, and it has been less in all years since, e.g. 0.016 Mt in 2008 (not among the top 69 species on the world list). The stock is in the most remote region of the world ocean, fuel costs for exploita- tion are extreme, and efforts to make krill palatable to people are only marginally successful. Processing is diffi- cult, since the digestive glands of the animals tend to break, spilling enzymes into the tissue which digest it and make it rot almost instantly. Very rapid, specialized preservation methods are required to produce a usable product. As a consequence of these difficulties, krill have not been very promising compared to alternative investments.
> Pauly et al. (1998) have shown that we are progressively moving closer to the base of the food chain in our exploita- tion, which they characterize as "fishing down the food chain". They argue that we are reducing stocks of higher- trophic-level fish (e.g. cod, tuna, swordfish) and moving more and more effort to planktivorous fish (pilchards, anchoveta, etc.). It is arguable whether placing our take at higher or lower trophic levels is the best strategy for fishery exploitation, but it is very likely that the trend does not represent a strategy. It simply reflects (i) the recurring reduction in stocks of the predatory fish favored at the table, as noted by Pauly et al., but just as important is (i) the recurring resurgence and exploitation of forage fish stocks, particularly the Peruvian anchoveta. At times the "mean trophic level" statistic used actually moves up. That occurs when the anchoveta or similar stocks collapse. The overall changes are a small fraction of one trophiclevel and probably do not mean much.

> Overall levels of exploitation of fishery stocks and the degree and significance of habitat modification by fishing activity are currently areas of active study and intense dispute. There is no question that the fauna of the modern ocean, at least above the bathypelagic and abyssal plains is substantially different from what it was (whatever it was) before industrial fishing. Even the very first fishing indus- tries modified ocean biota. An excellent review of the his- torical development of fisherieswas provided by Callum Roberts in The Unnatural History of the Sea (2007), and Anthony Koslow in The Silent Deep (2007) has covered the more recent effects of trawling in very deep habitats, par- ticularly the destruction of rich soft-coral communities on seamounts in the hunt for orange roughy andother long- lived fish. Orange roughy were rapidly fished to "commer- cial extinction". Roberts shows that 17th- to 19th-century whaling generated all but permanent endangered-species status for the right whales and sperm whales, although the latter may finally be coming back. Those devastations were accomplished from sailing ships by launching rowing boats armed with hand-thrown harpoons. Virtually no tropical islands have their former assemblage of large carnivorous fish, particularly groupers (Serranidae) and snappers (Lutjanidae). Those have mostly been fished out by sport and artisanal fishers, and sometimes by large-scale attacks with rotenone or explosives. Rosenberg et al. (2005) have roughly reconstructed from boat logs and other data a history of the New England and Scotian shelf cod stocks. They put biomass of the lightly fished stock of 1852 at 1.26 × 10° Mt. Industrial fishing and habitat damage in the middle to late 20th century reduced that to "less than
> 5 x 10* Mt today". Recovery has not been obvious during a near moratorium on cod fishing (they still are taken as bycatch) since 1994. There are too many such sad tales to recount here.
> Prominent in the recent controversies was a paper by Ransom Myers and B o r i sWorm (2003), based partly on the development of the Japanese long-line fishery for tuna and billfish after World War I. Excellent records were kept for this fishery as it expanded east from Japan into the

> basis of CPUE (catch per 100 hooks fished; Fig. 17.23) trends for oceanic areas, Myers and Worm (2003) esti- mated that residual stocks are ~ 1 0 % o f their mid-20th- century size for this overall species mix. Criticism followed
> quickly. For example, Maunder et al. (2006, discussed above) strongly criticized use of CPUE for estimating stock size, explicitly because it was the basis of Myers and Worm's claims. Long lining has indeed not been a consistent prac-
> tice, and different stocks are differentially susceptible to changing depths of the baits and other modifications.Some stocks, particularly yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific, have declined and then recovered to an extent, and a case can be made that they are sustainably harvested. However, others, particularly the larger sizes of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), prized for sushi, are stocks in extremis. The value of such fish interacts with availability to sustain fishing, even though catches diminish to nearly zero. One large bluefin (377kg) was sold for $396,700 at Tsukiii market in Tokyo i nJanuary 2011. That much money can buy lots of boat fuel and search time.The value has also led to live harvest of youngspecimens for pen-rearing off Australia and in the Mediterranean, which has its own problems and may or m a ynot relieve pressure on the wild s t o c k . Ten p e r c e n t m a y o r m a y n o t b e t h e b e s t o v e r a l l generalization for high-level predatory fish, but the global reductions in only about 50 years surely have strongly modified ocean ecosystems. Because of the shifting baseline
> effect, even ocean biologists come to think of hte new situ- ation as normal.
> Prominent among ecosystem rearrangements of recent decades, one attributable in part to fish stock reduction, is the increasing abundance of jellyfish, particularly of scy- phozoan medusae. Recall (Chapter 6) that this group alter- nates between a small (<1 cm), attached polyp stage and very large, dome-shaped medusae trailing masses of tenta- cles. The polyps "strobilate" producing larval medusae (ephyra) that grow to substantial sizes - from serving platter-size (Aurelia) to dinner-table size (Nemopilema). Reducing planktivorous fish stocks may reduce predation on ephyrae. Trawling may remove predators on polyps. Seasonal pulses of abundant medusae, like the summer outbursts of Chrysaora fuscescens off Oregon, USA, and in the Bering Sea then compete for zooplanktonmeals a n deat fish larvae, stabilizing the community shift.The mostdra- matic outbursts have been those of the 2m, 500 kg Nomura's jellyfish (Nemopilema nomuri) in waters surroundingJapan (Kawahara et al. 2006). Like many scyphozoan polyps, those of this monster are unusually tolerant of suboxia, which recently is prevalent in theirbenthic habitat beneath the outflow of the Changjiang River draining northeast China. Thus, it is likely they suffer reduced predation in this area where they are abundant on shallow bottoms, increasing production of larvae. The ephyrae grow as they are carried across the EastChina Sea, and turn north with the springtime Tsushima warm current into the East Korean/ Japan Sea. Someyears, Nomura's jellyfish are most promi- nent along the Korean coast, some years along the Japanese coast. Reaching Tsugaru Strait, the coastal flow carries them into the Pacific and south along-shore of Honshu. In many recent years they have been sufficiently nume- rous to stop all trawling. Netting just one or two fully developed medusae creates a serious problem for fishing machinery. The economic impact on Japanese and Korean

> The technology of some fisheries is relatively benign, apart from the fish killed. Hauling a trawl or trolling baited hooks through mid-water probably does not damage the biota significantly, apart from the fish targeted and cap- tured. But hauling trawls right against the bottom is another matter entirely. The "tickler chains" of large benthic trawls are hauled though the upper layers of sediment, capturing or breaking masses of invertebrates, plowing the sediment to several decimeters depth, leaving in some habitats a wasteland that takes years to regenerate (e.g. see Jennings et al. 2001). Some heavily trawled bottoms, such as Georges
> Bank or the eastern English Channel, probably have not approached anything like a natural, untrawled condition in
> many decades. In fact, into the early 19th century the seabed of the North Sea was entirely covered with oyster beds (Roberts 2007). Early trawlers pulled heavy chains over the whole region to improve the habitat for plaice and
> sole, and now it is all mud and sand. That is good if you like plaice and sole. In some cases, nearly natural benthic habitat conditions may be required for maintenance of the fish stocks that are targeted by the trawlers that disrupt the bottom. Thus, fishing not only removes fish, but also can hamper stock recovery. The entire issue has come strongly into public attention since the late 1990s, and work is under way to evaluate and mitigate trawl damage. Les Watling, a benthic ecologist, has been a leader on this issue (Watling 2005).

Lost gill nets go on fishing and fishing, sometimes for years, entangling both fish and mammals. Mammals, particularly the harbor porpoise in coastal regions, are often drowned while entangled in gill nets that are not lost. Recent inter- national conventions have somewhat reduced the net loss problem by requiring shorter, better-marked runs of net, and have reduced bycatch (and possibly catch) by closing some areas. These problemscannot be totally eliminated if we are going to fish. However, the tuna fisheries in the eastern tropical Pacific have achieved great reductions in porpoise mortality, despite continuing to set seinesaround porpoise schools. Similar reductions in sea-turtle mortality have been achieved in shrimp fisheries by installing turtle- excluding devices in trawl mouths. These and other success stories show that careful design of operationscan minimize bycatch and habitat destruction.
> A movement now afoot among environmentalists, fishery managers, and even the fishing industry seeks to protect commercial fishery stocks, other populations, and some parts of the marine habitat, by establishing reserves closed to fishing. It is reasonable to expect that refuges
> could allow some individual organisms to reach large size and high reproductive rates (to become BOFFF); that the young will prosper in undisturbed habitats; and that bur- geoning populations will spread from reserves into sur- rounding fishing zones. Many aspects of reserve design are under study, including physical dimensions, types of bottom to include, and siting that takes advantageof flow patterns. Both spawning sites, where abundant species congregate intermittently, and nursery areas are obvious candidate locations. Evaluation of sites and quantification of reserve effects have become research topics in their own right. Results already available s h o wdramatic success at improv- ing habitat quality and fishing in neighboring zones (Lubchenco et al. 2007), sometimes primarily just outside the reserve perimeter.

>    b) Hypotheses that explain stock changes and species interactions.
>    c) Elaborate terminology used by fishermen to describe fish behavior.
>    d) Fishing techniques used to capture different species of fish.
> 
> 2. Match-mismatch, critical periods, and Lasker windows are concepts that focus on:

> 4. The P2P loop describes a reversed interaction in which:
>    a) Predators protect forage fish by not consuming their eggs or larvae.
>    b) Forage fish prey heavily on the eggs and larvae of their predators.
>    c) Predators compete with each other to capture forage fish.
>    d) Forage fish and predators have a mutually beneficial relationship.

> 5. Loopholes in fisheries refer to:
>    a) Gaps in fishing regulations that allow for overexploitation of certain species.
>    b) Areas where predation on eggs or larvae is low, providing suitable habitat.
>    c) Fishing techniques that allow fishermen to catch more fish in a short period.
>    d) Protocols for releasing bycatch and minimizing environmental impacts.
