**assistant**:
> To convert the type of a tibble column from character (chr) to numeric (dbl), you can use the `as.double()` function. Here's an example:
> 
> ```
> library(tidyverse)
> 
> # Create a tibble with a character column
> df <- tibble(x = c("1", "2", "3"))
> 
> # Convert the character column to numeric using as.double()
> df <- df %>% mutate(x = as.double(x))
> 
> # Check the class of the column
> class(df$x)
> ```
> 
> This will convert the `x` column from character to numeric and return the result `[1] "double"`, indicating that the column is now of class double.
> 
> You can also use the `mutate_at()` function from the `tidyverse` package to apply the conversion to multiple columns at once. For example:
> 
> ```
> df <- tibble(x = c("1", "2", "3"), y = c("4", "5", "6"))
> 
> df <- df %>% mutate_at(vars(x, y), as.double)
> ```
> 
> This will convert both the `x` and `y` columns to numeric.
> 
> Note that the `as.double()` function will return `NA` for any values that cannot be converted to a numeric type. If you want to skip these values and only convert those that can be safely converted, you can use the `as.double(x, na.rm = TRUE)` version of the function, which will remove any `NA` values.
