**assistant**:
> Hi Austin! I'm so happy to hear about everything you're into, especially the "bad guys", dragons, and pirates! Now let's take a little adventure together to find out how yogurt is made. It's a bit like a cooking experiment! 
> 
> Think of it as making something similar to a potion, like a wizard or a princess might do. In our yogurt potion, we have two main ingredients: 
> 
> 1. Milk – this could be straight from a cow like the one in Sesame Street.
> 2. Friendly bacteria – yes, just like how you sometimes get a bit of a cold, most bacteria are good and help us with things like making tasty yogurt!
> 
> Here's the step by step process (please remember dad should help you with these since it involves heat):
> 
> 1. First, we take the milk and heat it up to 180°F/82°C (like Elmo when he's in the sun on a hot day!). 
> 
> 2. Then, we let it cool down to 115°F/46°C (like when Elmo takes a rest in the shade during summer).
> 
> 3. Now, this is where friendly bacteria join the party. The bacteria we use are called **Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus**. That’s a mouthful, right? You can just call them the "yogurt buddies". We mix a spoonful of yogurt that has these "yogurt buddies" already in it, into the cooled milk.
> 
> 4. Then, we let them all rest together in a warm place for about 6 to 12 hours. It's like when Daniel Tiger goes to bed at night. 
> 
> 5. While we're waiting, the friendly bacteria get to work. They eat the sugars in the milk and produce lactic acid. That makes the milk thick and tangy... and, voilà! You have yogurt! 
> 
> Remember, making yogurt involves using the stove and sometimes it might not work the very first time (even a knight fails a mission sometimes, right?). But keep trying, and I'm sure you'd be able to make delicious yogurt!
> 
> You know Austin, bacteria are very important for our bodies too. They're the friendly 'critters' living within us and help us with many things such as digestion. Just like how good characters like Mickey Mouse, Moana, or Kermit help their friends in their adventures.
