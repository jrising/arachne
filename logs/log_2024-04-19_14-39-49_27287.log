> How do I write a string that includes a variable in python?
**assistant**:
> In Python, you can include a variable within a string using several methods. I'll demonstrate a few of them:
> 
> 1. **Using the `format()` function:**
>     Let's say your variable is a name saved as `my_name = "James"`.
> 
>     You can include this variable in a string using the `format()` function like this:
> 
>     ```python
>     my_name = "James"
>     print("Hello, {}!".format(my_name))  # Output: Hello, James!
>     ```
> 
> 2. **Using f-strings (Python 3.6 and above):**
>     F-strings (formatted string literals) make it even easier to include variables in a string. Here's how you can use them:
> 
>     ```python
>     my_name = "James"
>     print(f"Hello, {my_name}!")  # Output: Hello, James!
>     ```
> 
> 3. **Using `%` operator (older method):**
> 
>     ```python
>     my_name = "James"
>     print("Hello, %s!" % my_name)  # Output: Hello, James!
>     ```
> 
> In my opinion, f-strings are often the most readable and convenient method for including variables in a string, if you're using a version of Python that supports them. But the other methods work well too, especially `format()`.
