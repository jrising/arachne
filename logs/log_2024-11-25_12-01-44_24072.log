**assistant**:
> It sounds like the process you used has rewritten your commit history, which likely changed the commit hashes and might have affected the ability to locate your soft reset commit. Here are some steps to try and recover your lost data:
> 
> 1. **Backup your current state:** Before making further changes, it's a good idea to make a complete backup of your repository directory to avoid exacerbating any problems.
> 
> 2. **Check the reflog:** Git keeps track of where your HEAD references have been with `git reflog`. This might provide a pointer to the commit you soft-reset to:
> 
>    ```sh
>    git reflog
>    ```
> 
>    Look through the entries for the commit hash of the commit just before you performed the history rewrite. You might be able to reset or checkout to this previous state.
> 
> 3. **Recover from the stash (if used):** If you had used `git stash` at any point, you might be able to recover your changes there:
> 
>    ```sh
>    git stash list
>    git stash apply # or `git stash pop` to apply and remove
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Look through saved references:** When you use `git filter-repo`, it typically creates some references within `.git/refs/`, such as `refs/original/`, which could hold your prior state. Check these:
> 
>    ```sh
>    ls .git/refs/original/
>    git log refs/original/<ref>
>    ```
> 
>    If you find your lost commit here, you can revert to it or create a branch pointing to it.
> 
> 5. **Manual object search (as a last resort):** If the above does not help, you might attempt to search through Git's objects. This is quite advanced and involves exploring the `.git/objects/` directory, perhaps with a script to try and reconstruct lost commits manually. However, this step is usually not required unless all else fails.

**assistant**:
> If `git reflog`, `git stash`, and `.git/refs/original` are empty, it suggests that the references to your previous state might have been lost during the filter operation. However, there are still a few avenues you can explore for potential recovery:
> 
> 1. **Check for Unreferenced Objects:**
>    Git keeps all the objects (commits, blobs, trees) even if they aren't referenced in the usual way. You can use `git fsck` to find dangling commits or blobs that might contain your lost data:
> 
>    ```sh
>    git fsck --lost-found
>    ```
> 
>    This will create two directories in `.git/lost-found/`: `commit` for dangling commits and `other` for other objects. Check the commits in `.git/lost-found/commit/` for your previous work.
> 
> 2. **Examine the Object Database:**
>    If you find any interesting commits or blobs, you can explore them using:
> 
>    ```sh
>    git show <object_id>
>    ```
> 
>    Where `<object_id>` would be the hash of the commit or blob you're interested in.
> 
> 3. **Using `git reflog expire` Command:**
>    If you suspect that your reflog may have been pruned due to configuration settings (like `gc.reflogExpire`), you can run the following command to check and potentially adjust the settings to expand the reflog's time frame:
> 
>    ```sh
>    git reflog expire --expire=now --all
>    ```
> 
>    Then, run `git reflog` again just in case.
> 
> 4. **File Recovery Tools:**
>    If the data is critical and cannot be found in Git, consider file recovery tools that can scan your filesystem for deleted files. This is more applicable if the changes were not saved in any permanent commit.
> 
> 5. **Check Your IDE/Editor:**
>    Some integrated development environments (IDEs) and editors (like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, etc.) maintain local history of file changes that might allow you to recover recent changes.
> 
> If you still can't recover your data, it might be a good idea to implement a more robust backup strategy in the future, such as using a dedicated remote backup or regularly pushing branches to a remote repository. Let me know if you need further assistance on any of these steps!
