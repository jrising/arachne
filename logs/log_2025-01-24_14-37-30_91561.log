> I am writing a grant proposal. The grant proposal follows the scoping document included here:
> ===
> 
> Economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK, and benefits of adaptation action
> 
> Informal scoping document
> December 2024
> 
> 1. Overview and scope
> 
> We are looking to produce UK-level climate damage scenarios with a specific focus on the macro-economic impacts. We want to use these impacts as the basis for developing our understanding of the fiscal impacts, and as part of a longer-term piece around the benefits of adaptation actions.
> 
> We want to try and take a hybrid approach bringing together all the best UK sector modelling and then incorporating the results within a macro-modelling framework like Nigem. To note, this approach mirrors the one in Nicola’s Nature GFI study.
> 
> 2. Context
> 
> Over the past year, we’ve done a bit of work using Nigem/ NGFS and come up against the fact that they are not UK-specific and have limited coverage of risk channels (including nothing on international spillovers). Colleagues on the fiscal side built an internal tool to translate macro impacts into fiscal ones, but the work was paused due to the issues with NGFS at a UK level. 
> 
> The OBR covered climate damages as part of their Fiscal Risks and Sustainability report 2024, but have held off covering adaptation due to current data gaps. They plan to come back to this in the next phase of the work (most likely, post-CCRA4 publication in 2026).
> 
> Finally, we’ve been working with Paul Watkiss as part of his ACCREU (EC Horizon) work on adaptation investment needs, building on the CCC’s adaptation investment report. This has been useful in framing our thinking but has also shone a light on the variable quality of the evidence on the benefits of adaptation action. We would like to improve this as part of an ongoing programme of work, linking it back to the climate damage assessment, which we see as the key first step.
> 
> We’ve pulled together a community of interested parties across HMG and got support from our Executive Management Board here at HMT. The OBR are also really keen to be able to do more having taken stock of just how challenging it is in their recent FRS report.
> 
> There are other programmes of work which we can draw on:
> •	UKRI projects. This includes a climate-related food price shocks project led by Pete Smith and Anna Taylor and an ATTENUATE project which looks at the benefits of adaptation action, taking a case studies approach.
> •	CCRA4 – this includes sectoral deep dives. The intention is to publish a dataset in spreadsheet form which includes benefits of adaptation action.
> •	Project Delta (including BoE and Met Office) which is looking at improving the quality of granular UK data on physical risks.
> 
> 3. Research questions and objectives
> 
> There are three core questions which HMT (and the OBR) would like to be in a position to answer:
> a)	What are UK macroeconomic impacts of climate change, including international spillovers/imported risk (addressing the limitations of NGFS), and accounting for autonomous adaptation and its costs?
> b)	What are the fiscal impacts associated with these damage and adaptation costs (updating the OBR FRS24, which relied on NGFS for inputs)?
> c)	Across a suite of key adaptation options, what are fiscal and socioeconomic costs associated with various levels of risk reduction?
> d)	How can funding best distributed across adaptation options to achieve risk reduction goals?
> 
> We are looking for expertise in particular on a) and c), with an initial focus on a). If needed, we can scope b) out and cover that within HMT/OBR.
> 
> The objectives are then:
> 1.	Shape HMT’s understanding and response to climate risk, including our approach to managing economic and fiscal risk and our international and financial stability work (questions a-c, with a focus on a). 
> 1.1.	Develop outputs on macroeconomic impacts that we can use as part of our core narrative across HMT and for Ministers, as well as the basis for our ongoing work in this space.
> 1.2.	Set out an economic baseline which includes climate damage for use as a reference point for framing our work on economic growth, rather than the de facto ‘no climate’ baseline.
> 2.	Ensure our quantification of the fiscal risks is based on the best evidence that we have no major gaps on transmission channels.
> 3.	Ensure spending decisions on climate adaptation are based on the best possible evidence, and the benefits can be traced back to an assessment of UK climate damages.
> 4.	Support timely decision-making as part of an ongoing programme of work, by designing the approach to include new evidence as and when this is available, including 2026 CCRA4 outputs on adaptation, and developing open-source tools.
> 5.	Support other countries to undertake similar work, by developing open-source tools and sharing insights.
> 
> 4. Outputs
> 
> The critical piece for us is that the modelling tools and assumptions are fully transparent and well documented, including detailed outputs in spreadsheet format (interim sectoral results and macroeconomic outputs) which can be shared. 
> 
> Ideally, we would like to be able to run the macroeconomic model in-house, as would the OBR, and develop tools that can be updated with better evidence as and when (including CCRA4 outputs for example, or anything coming out of OECD and IMF modelling on the international side). Being able to run models in-house also increases the likelihood that these will have a more significant policy impact and become embedded in day-to-day thinking.
> 
> 5. Approach
>  
> We want to bring together some of the best sector modelling expertise across the UK, building on the 2021 Grantham study, including people like Paul Bates from Bristol on floods. On the international side, we would like to try and replicate some of the approach again in the GFI study which covered complex supply chain risks and food price impacts across multiple scenarios (e.g. El Nino, multiple breadbasket failures), bringing together relevant experts in each area and using historical analogues to fill data gaps). Brendan Bailey here at HMT would be a very good person to have involved in this as someone with a lot of expertise and relevant knowledge. 
>  
> In order to be able to aggregate fiscal impacts, we also need to be able to split out public and private sector benefits.
> 
> From our work to date, we are particularly aware of the poor quality of evidence on the benefits of adaptation action – it is therefore really important to be able to build in better information on this as the evidence continues to be developed.
>  
> We’d also like to try and build in a bit of a backcasting exercise to calibrate estimates with historical damage. There’s some existing work going on there at Manchester University and some more in the pipeline. Note that the Met Office are interested in building a database of damage costs in the future which could be used as a data source (replicating something that NOAA have which goes back to the 80s and has great visualisations - Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters | National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) (noaa.gov)).
> 
> Scenarios
> We would like to take a scenarios approach, which reflects different levels of warming. This could build on the OBR’s approach in FRS24 where they had two scenarios – a) under 2 degrees C and b) under 3 degrees C.
> 
> We suggest adding to that: c) under 4 degrees C, plus d) scenario(s) which look at tail risks such as AMOC collapse.
> 
> Outstanding questions
> Important questions to be worked up are:
> •	What are the information requirements from the sectoral models (including format) 
> •	What macro framework do we want to work with
> •	What are the boundaries for the work (i.e. do we scope out the fiscal impacts on the basis that HMT/OBR can cover these)
> •	What can be delivered under a first phase of the work (e.g. a [6] month timeline).
> 
> 
> 6. Tasks
> 
> We’ve discussed splitting the work in to two phases.
> 
> Phase 1
> An initial [6]-month phase which looks at rapidly bringing together evidence on the impacts of climate damage and incorporates these into a macroeconomic modelling framework, working with macro modellers to generate UK-wide impacts (i.e. question a).
> 
> Success criteria:
> •	New dataset set out in spreadsheet with time series of economic impacts broken down by sector, in a format in which it can be built into a macro model.
> •	New inputs on international risks / spillovers in a format which can be integrated.
> •	Plan in train for incorporating these into a macro modelling framework, ideally with initial results.
> 
> We think this is achievable because the existing LSE Grantham study already brings together a lot of the useful UK-specific data. Nicola’s Nature GFI study is a great example of what you can do on international supply chain impacts within a 6-12 month window (as well as a great test case for using a hybrid approach).
> 
> Phase 2
> Expanding the scope to cover question c in particular.
> 
> 7. Governance
> We would be happy to participate by way of steering group, alongside a number of other public bodies and experts, to maximise the policy relevance of the work and ensure it is built into our work (e.g. forecasting, framing of green growth, link to how we estimate indirect effects on the fiscal side, potentially also growth metrics).
> 
> As a core user group, I think you want:
> •	HMT (mix of teams, including EGU and Economic Risks)
> •	OBR (suggest Alison Todd)
> •	Defra (Ashley Diggins).
> 
> We could consider adding CCC, Met Office and BoE (we can suggest contacts again).
> 
> Jenny has some leave planned in Q1 of next year, but can add
> touchpoints for this work.

> ===
> And here are some further responses from an email thread:
> 
> James:
> I think there's a tension around the resolution here. You mainly talk about macroeconomic impacts, so I think you're thinking about nationally-aggregated impacts, but adaptation is much more local. Even in the first 6-month stage, I think you should propose to bring together high-resolution impact estimates, which would then be translated into UK-wide macroeconomic and fiscal risks.
> 
> I'm also not sure how you're thinking about variability and uncertainty. Even within, say, a 3 C scenario without AMOC collapse, plausible damage estimates could differ by almost an order of magnitude. And usually for warming levels, we report time-averaged damages, but HMT is probably more concerned about individual years with particularly bad outcomes. You could make that explicit.
> 
> I have thoughts on your "outstanding questions" from my side, but since you plan to bring together multiple teams, I think we probably want to bring together everyone's initial answers and develop some kind of proposed consensus.
> 
> Jenny:
> On the local data point – this dovetails neatly with a conversation I had with colleagues in the Bank and Met Office earlier this week about Project Delta. My main reflection was that this could fit well with the work we are looking to do on the macro and fiscal impacts of climate, because it is basically about how financial services (and policy makers) can get much better access to the granular data which the Met Office hold.
> 
> By way of brief readout (not for sharing more widely at this stage):
> 
> Met Services sit on a lot of really useful info - so project Delta would look to connect these up with financial services. The idea is to develop a guide in a first instance of the granular data available.
> They plan to link this to the NGFS – although the initial focus is on financial services, they are also interesting in how to make this relevant to policymakers.
> They are also keen for it to have an international impact are looking to tie it in to the G20 therefore. It helps that South Africa (current chair) is pushing adaptation. It would be powerful to be able to say, and "here's how we could get the data globally".
> Kristina at the Met Office clarified that this is separate to the separate project she would like to get off the ground, to replicate the NOAA historical dataset on damages. The next steps there are scoping the questions and looking to line up funding. Engaging ABI could be a good route.
> Kristina also noted that the Dutch and Danes have much better damages data.
>  
> 
> In terms of how Project Delta could fit with our damages work:
> 
> I think it adds a compelling new dimension to the initial phase engagement with sector experts in academia, because we are able to say not only, here is how you can work with us to bring out the data in your modelling and use it in a policy context, but also – we can explore how to make more of the Met Office granular data accessible to you.
> Project Delta is looking to use five case studies – so the UK could potentially be a case study, and we could draw on the other four for the spillovers work.
> In terms of next steps:
> 
> Let’s give it to the end of this week for any further comments – particularly welcome any further views from @Jameson,D and @Nicola Ranger (including on how to approach NIESR).
> I think it would be good to then firm up the plans and work up the grant proposal for Leo at QCF.
> 
> James:
> On direct/indirect costs: Yes, I'm thinking of barrier costs and policy inefficiencies. It's probably easier to define the direct costs as "engineering costs" (purchasing, installing, and maintaining pieces of technology), and my point is just that there are a lot of non-engineering costs to actually implementing or incentivising change.
> 
> On a fortnight plan: Do you mean finalizing this scoping document or a grant proposal to Leo? If we want to engage a wider group of modelers, we need to start by reaching out with the scoping document, and it will take longer than 2 weeks just to figure out exactly which impact channels and adaptation processes we can convincingly handle. But with Nicola and Daisy's input, I could start that process.
> 
> Jenny:
> Agree that’s a helpful distinction on costs. The CCC made a move from talking about the abatement costs (including the opex stream, discounted back) to focussing more on the investment costs as the core narrative in the 2021 Sixth Carbon Budget. I think that was really helpful, and we’ve then used their analysis here as part of our preparatory scenarios going in to the SR process. We also worked up parallel scenarios on adaptation investment needs with Paul Watkiss, though with the caveat around needing to improve the quality of the data beyond flooding and transport infra, and to be clear on the benefits.
> 
> There is a distinction between those strict investment costs and the capital costs for policy support (particularly on big infra projects, e.g. planning etc). That tension does then come up when we look at the actual costs of supporting nuclear, CCUS etc. So having a method which splits these out will make it easier for policy colleagues to understand and work with the estimates.
> 
> On the next steps, I think it’s totally fine for it to take a bit longer to bring together a consortium and finalise a grant proposal. The key test I think at this stage is whether we have good agreement on the current terms of the work, and a core team who can lead this forward. If you are happy to take on the role then that is excellent news.
> 
> Daisy:
> Thanks very much for this – great to hear thoughts from everyone. Not much to add from me, I just wanted to clarify a couple of points:
> 
> •                 Based on a meeting we had just before Christmas with MO/BoE,  myself and colleagues here were under the understanding that the focus of the Delta project wasn’t to improve data on physical risks, but instead on the format and accessibility of the wealth of data that the MO already holds. Just a quick clarifying point but I think it changes the scope of the project somewhat.
> 
> •                 On scenarios – just to flag and I’m sure you’re aware that CCRA4 are planning on using GWLs and two scenarios that aren’t quite the same as the OBR’s. More detail can be found here. This will likely only be relevant for part c) of the project.

> I’m very happy to explore how we can bring in the method from the GFI study and link to NiGEM
