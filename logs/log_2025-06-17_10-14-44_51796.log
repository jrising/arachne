**assistant**:
> Your issue might indeed be related to how the Brave browser handles local storage and other tracking mechanisms, as it is designed with privacy in mind and may restrict or clear data that other browsers would persist.
> 
> However, there are a few considerations and potential solutions:
> 
> 1. **Check Brave Settings:** By default, Brave blocks many types of tracking scripts and might clear storage between sessions depending on privacy settings. Check Brave's privacy settings to see if itâ€™s set to aggressively block or delete local data.
> 
> 2. **Persistence in Local Storage:** Normally, `localStorage` should persist data across sessions unless manually cleared by the user or by browsing in incognito mode. Ensure that you are not testing this functionality in a private/incognito session, which typically doesn't retain data after the session ends.
> 
> 3. **Alternative Storage Solutions:** If local storage is unreliable due to browser restrictions, consider using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for more persistent client-side storage that might be handled differently by privacy-centric browsers.
> 
> 4. **Cookie Alternatives:** While `localStorage` is generally the correct method for client-side persistence beyond the lifespan of a session, cookies might be more persistent and recognized differently by the browser's privacy systems. Set a persistent cookie with a specific expiration time:
>    ```javascript
>    document.cookie = "votedStatements=" + JSON.stringify(votedStatements) + ";max-age=1209600";  // 2 weeks in seconds
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Review for Bugs:** Double-check your code logic to ensure that values aren't inadvertently reset elsewhere. Make sure any operations on `votedStatements` correctly modify and save the updated state back to storage.
> 
> By exploring these avenues, you should be able to achieve more reliable persistence of voting data across sessions and browsers. If the issue stems specifically from Brave's privacy measures, using alternate storage solutions might provide a solution.
