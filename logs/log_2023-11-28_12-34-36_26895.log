**user**:
> I have an Ubuntu system with two monitors. Both monitors are plugged into the tower, and both have power, but only one is recieving any video. What could be wrong?
**assistant**:
> Your issue of one monitor not receiving video while the other does on an Ubuntu system could be due to several reasons. Here are some initial steps to troubleshoot:
> 
> 1. **Check Hardware**: Ensure that both monitors are working properly by swapping the cables between the two and checking if the issue follows the monitor or the cable. Also, inspect your video cables and ports for any visible damage. 
> 
> 2. **Display Settings**: Ubuntu may not be configured to use the second monitor. Open Display settings (navigate to `Activities > Settings > Devices > Displays`). If both monitors are working, they should be listed here. You should be able to enable or disable monitors and change the display mode (mirroring or extending the display). 
> 
> 3. **Use `xrandr`**: This is a command-line tool for configuring screen resolution and monitor settings. Open a Terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T`) and type `xrandr --query`. This will show you the connected and disconnected displays. If your second monitor is listed but not connected, you can use `xrandr` to enable it (`xrandr --output HDMI-2 --auto`, replacing "HDMI-2" with your monitor's connection).
> 
> 4. **Graphics Drivers**: The issue might be due to graphics drivers. In Ubuntu go to `Activities > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers` to see if there are proprietary drivers that you can use. Different GPUs may require specific drivers to operate correctly. 
> 
> 5. **Use ARandR**: This is a simple visual front end for `xrandr`, useful for systems with dual monitors. You can install it using `sudo apt install arandr`.
> 
> Remember to restart your system after making changes to ensure they take effect.
> 
> If you've done these steps and the problem persists, more detailed diagnostics will be needed. I'm here to help with any further information or advice you need!
