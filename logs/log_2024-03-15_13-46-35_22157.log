> How should I read the result of a Levin–Lin–Chu  unit root test. If it's significant, what does that mean?
**assistant**:

In this scenario, the time series is stationary. This is considered "significant" because it suggest that your data do not follow a random walk and are therefore predictable to some degree.

This means you assume that the time series is non-stationary. In simpler terms, the variable has a unit root, and therefore follows a random walk.

Conversely, if your variables aren’t stationary, you may need to difference them or use techniques that can handle non-stationarity.
