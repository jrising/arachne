> 15.1.1 Rising Food Insecurity in West Africa (relate to SDGs)
> 
> The prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity across LLMICs has increased by an average 13% since 2015. In 2021, over half of LLMICs experienced food insecurity impacting at least 50% of their populations. West Africa is characteristic of this trend, and food insecurity has been rising in our main countries of interest, Senegal and Nigeria, since 2017 (see Fig. 1).

> 
> Food insecurity continues to rise, even as total per capita calories supply has increased across most of West Africa. This paradox of greater food availability and greater food insecurity is driven by problems with access, nutrition, and reliability, as well as by export-driven food production. Food wastage is also a growing problem across sub-Saharan Africa which needs to be addressed through better access to refrigeration and preservation techniques (Sheehan and Barrett, 2017). In the aquatic food production chain, improved implementation of safety and quality assurance systems will lead to safer food with higher nutritional quality, extended shelf-life and reduced post-harvest losses (GarridoGamarro et al, 2023).
> 
> The food system is complex, with some populations particularly vulnerable to near-term climate impacts. Such effects have significant implications for our ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. SDG 1, 2, 3, 13, 14 15). In particular, we will study health consequences in low-income countries like those in West Africa, and their most vulnerable populations, in collaboration with researchers having existing stakeholder relationships and access to on-the-ground data. Our approach emphasizes the impact of climate change on food production and ecosystem services, and the communities involved in food production. The project will co-create tools or data facilitating the resilience of these vulnerable groups to health risks, as well as design and suggest mitigation and adaptation policies and risk management.

> 
> 15.1.2 Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture and Fisheries
> The agricultural sector in Africa experiences severe challenges arising from climate change (Fofana 2011, Lokonon 2018, Adeleye et al 2021), and employs 55–62% of the sub-Saharan workforce and 95% of cropland is rainfed (Trisos et al. 2022, Osabohien et al. 2020). The effects of climatic shocks (e.g., heat intensity, variable rainfall) are predicted to result in depletion of soil nutrients, low productivity, shortage of food and welfare of the African farmers (Osabohien et al. 2020, Osofur and Nnorom 2014, Hatfield et al. 2018). Estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Trisos et al. 2022) indicate that future warming will negatively affect food systems in Africa by shortening growing seasons and increasing water stress. Although yield declines for some crops may be partially compensated by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrients are not expected to keep pace and global warming above 2°C will result in yield reductions for staple crops across most of Africa compared to 2005 yields (Trisos et al. 2022). Onyeneke et al. (2020) reviews the literature on the effect of climate change on the Nigerian agricultural sector.
> Climate change also affects fisheries and marine environments, by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean such as temperatures, pH, oxygen content and salinity (World Bank 2019, Kroetz et al. 2022, Abbot et al. 2022, Asche et al. 2022, Cojocaru et al. 2022). These attributes can contribute to undesirable impacts on fish stock movements but also fish habitats. Studies on the marine ecosystems indicate that warming oceans can have adverse effects such as restructuring of species composition (Fodrie et al. 2010, Wernberg et al. 2016, Flanagan et al. 2019); changes in species phenology (Edwards and Richardson 2004, Mills et al. 2013, Staudinger et al. 2019); changes in geographic species distributions (Pinsky et al. 2013, Poloczanska et al. 2013);  accessibility of target species to fisherman (Young et al. 2018, Pinsky and Fogarty 2012, Hughes et al. 2015); changes in stock productivity (Hare and Able 2007, Bell et al. 2014, Pershing et al. 2015); possible global loss of biomass in the oceans, especially at the middle and lower latitudes (Lotze et al. 2019); potential decline in landings by the 21st century on many of the most valuable fishing grounds (Cheung et al. 2010, Free et al. 2019).
> 
> 15.1.3 Importance of Ecosystem Services
> More broadly, these environments provide a multitude of globally important ecosystem services beneficial for human health and wellbeing (Hattam et al. 2015), including provisioning services (e.g., seafood, medicines) (FAO 2018), regulatory services (e.g., climate regulation, nutrient recycling) (van den Belt et al. 2016), and cultural services (e.g., recreation/tourism) (Rees et al. 2010). Aquatic food alone is a key source of protein for 3.2 billion people, especially in developing countries (FAO, 2018). However, human actions have severely degraded global marine ecosystems’ abilities to deliver these services, with direct and indirect implications for the health of billions of people (Depledge et al. 2019, Fleming et al. 2019, Borja et al. 2020).
> 
> While existing research connects agricultural and fisheries productivity to climatic features (growing degree-days, rainfall, sea surface temperatures), the role of ecosystem services is understudied. We seek to fill this gap with this project by analyzing how the impacts of climate change could depend upon the gradual evolution of ecosystem health. Agriculture depends on ecosystem processes that ensure soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification. Fisheries need thriving habitats and balanced food webs. Such ecosystem services are likely to be affected by climate change factors.

> 15.1.4 Role and Vulnerability of Small-holder Farmers and Fishers
> 
> Our focus will be on farmers and fishers and their surrounding communities. Subsistence producers and small-holder producers who use proceeds to purchase food are particularly vulnerable. In addition, heat has direct impacts on farmer/fisher health and can undermine other sources of rural income. Nigeria and Senegal reflect the high prevalence of small-holder farming and fishing in West Africa. Nigeria is estimated to have 300,000 family farms and 3.3 million people involved in small-scaling fishing. The numbers for Senegal are 440,000 and 120,000.
> The Nigerian agricultural sector is primarily rainfed and employs around 36% of the labor force; and more that 80% are non-homogenous smallholder farmers who provide 90% of Nigeria’s agricultural produce (Afcfta 2020). Over 70% of Nigerians engage in the agricultural sector mainly at a subsistence level. Despite this activity, cumulative agriculture imports, over the years of 2016 and 2019, stood at N3.35 trillion. Major explanations for this situation, according to the FAO, are poor land tenure system, low level of irrigation farming, climate change and land degradation. Others are low technology, high production cost and poor distribution of inputs, limited financing, high post-harvest losses and poor access to markets.
> Per capita annual consumption of fish in Senegal has been dropping from year to year (e.g., from 29 kg 2008 to 16 kg in 2018). Per capita production is expected to be in the order of 32 kg/person/year if it were entirely destined for the domestic market (compared to the current 16). Despite the relatively low level of per capita fish consumption in Senegal which is a Low-Income Food-Deficit Country (LIFDC), the contribution of fish to animal protein intake is relatively large (24%) in Senegal. (Müller et al. 2011). The food supply of the Senegalese people remains dominated by rice and fishery products, including small pelagic fish. Prices of meat and chicken are too high and rising. Adverse developments in the fishing sector in Senegal as a result of climate change alone could have significant implications for people who depend on fish for food and as a source of nutrition, income and job opportunities, and the contribution of fisheries to Senegal as a country.

> 15.1.5 Consequences of Malnutrition on Health
> 
> Food scarcity, due to crop failure and weakened fisheries, can lead to malnutrition and both acute health problems and long-lasting consequences for individuals and communities. Crop failure can lead to both reductions in availability of produce and access (e.g., through income loss). Weakened fisheries similarly undermine the availability and access to protein, as well as essential micronutrients unique to the aquatic food production chain (e.g. iodine, vitamin D, marine omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA)). Increased harmful algal blooms can also result in shellfish poisoning.
> 
> Lack of nutritious food helps to explain the high rates of stunting in these two countries: 31.5% in Nigeria and 17.9% in Senegal (World Bank Data).
> 15.2 Research plan (Intro: 0.5 pg)
> 
> Our research focuses on the implications of climate change on food production from the agricultural and fishing sectors and subsequent consequences for health. We pay special attention to vulnerable populations, and small-holder producers in particular. The analysis further takes into account how ecosystem health mediates the relationships between climate change and outcomes for agriculture and fish productivity, food security and human health.

> NOWASTING is a stakeholder-centered project, with frequent interaction with local stakeholders to shape the project analysis and outcomes. Stakeholders to be engaged in the project include representatives of (1) food insecure communities, (2) small-holder producer /small-scale fishers and producer groups, (3) food supply chain firms, and (4) representatives of local and national government.
> 
> Initial meetings with stakeholders will focus on refining the analysis through scenario development. Stakeholders will be engaged around the goals, methods, and outputs of the project. A priority list of crucial and relevant issues/scenarios regarding fisheries and agricultural crop production will be co-developed with stakeholders, and will include assessments of the   social, economic and environmental risks, uncertainties,and prospective opportunities. 
> 
> Concrete, uncertainty socioeconomic and climate scenarios will be constructed by combining a suite of Earth System Models (ESMs) under existing Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). SSPs that are consistent with stakeholder storylines will be identified or a weighted average of SSPs will be used. ESMs projected that produce warming patterns consistent with stakeholder storylines will then be paired with these SSPs. The resulting hazard information will be shared with stakeholders, and these constructed scenarios will be used throughout the project.

>            	Climate variables 
> Precipitation datasets will be Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS v2.0) (spatial resolution: 0.05°; [PM2] temporal resolution: daily; time period: 1981–2021) (Funk et al., 2015), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) (spatial resolution: 0.25°; temporal resolution: daily; time period used: 1998–2015) (Huffman et al., 2007), Climate Research Unit (CRU) v3.23 (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: daily; time period used:  1981–2021) (Harris),  and Willmot-Matsura (WM) (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: monthly; time period used: 1991–2017) (Willmot & Matsura). Temperature datasets will be Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) (spatial resolution: 1°; temporal resolution: monthly; time period used: 1989–2021) (Rohde et al.,2013), Climate Research Unit (CRU) v3.23 (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: daily; time period used/available:  1989–2021) (Harris et al., 2014), and Willmot-Matsura (WM) (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: monthly; time period used/available:  1989–2017) (Willmot & Matsura).  These datasets will be used to calculate a suite of variables to quantify climate anomalies (Table 1). The mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperatures were determined by calculating temporal averages of the monthly temperature, monthly minimum temperature, and monthly maximum temperature, respectively, over the course of the main growing season (March to October). Diurnal temperature range was calculated as the difference between the maximum and the minimum temperatures recorded over a 24-hour period. 5-year and 10-year rainfall anomalies were calculated as the mean deviation from the long-term average rainfall over the prior five- and ten- years, respectively. Infrastructural and demographic data of most parts of Nigeria are available from GRID3 Nigeria (grid3.gov.ng) and also the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS: https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/)l data will be leveraged for the project  analysis. 
> Demographic health surveys
> Some of the main health data will come from the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) (DHS 2008, 2013, 2018[MP3] ), which are nationally representative household-level survey data on demography, health, and nutrition. We will use all DHS survey years for which georeferenced data were available. The DHS variables of interest are child age, wealth index, time to water, education of household head, improved toilet, improved water, and 24-hour recall for 10 food groups (which asks the respondents to recall what they feed their children under five in the previous 24 hours). This 24-recall variable is a qualitative measure of food consumption that indicates household access to different types of foods and is also a proxy for nutrient sufficiency of the diet of individuals (Kennedy et al., 2011). We will use this information to calculate our outcome variable of interest – individual diet diversity score (IDDS) for each child under 5. IDDS is calculated based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (Kennedy et al., 2011), and is a scale ranging from 1 to 10 based on the intake of 10 different types of food groups including: (a) cereal grains, (b) white tubers and root foods, (c) dark leafy greens, (d) vitamin A rich vegetables/tubers, (e) vitamin A rich fruits, (f) other fruits and vegetables, (g) meat and fish foods, (h) eggs, (i) legumes/nuts/seeds, and (j) milk and milk products. Other covariates variables used for this analysis are described in the section immediately below.
> Covariates of dietary and economic outcomes
> Population density data will come from NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) (CIESIN, 2018) database at a spatial resolution of 30-arcsec (1km). The year of the data used for an individual cluster will depend on the year of the DHS survey. We will average the population density over a 5-kilometer radius for each DHS cluster. We will calculate distance to roads using the Global Distribution of Roads dataset from NASA SEDAC (CIESIN, 2013). We will calculate distance to urban centers using the Gridded Population of the World database (version 1) from NASA SEDAC (MEA, 2005). We will calculate livestock density data using the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW3) database (Gilbert et al., 2010) which provides the global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, and ducks for the year 2010. In each country and for each type of livestock, a livestock unit will be calculated by taking the ratio of production in tonnes to the number of animals produced/slaughtered (FAOSTAT, 2023). This factor will then be multiplied by the population density rasters of each animal, and all rasters will be added to obtain the total livestock unit for each grid cell. We will average the livestock density within 10 kilometers of each DHS cluster and categorize it into 8 different quantile-based classes based on the distribution of the data for each country. Initial forest cover will be defined as any 30m by 30m pixel having a tree cover percentage of greater than 50% in the year 1999 using Tropical Moist Forest (TMF) dataset (Vancutsum et al., 2020), and all locations of known tree plantations (i.e., not native forests) will be excluded from our analysis. A pixel will be defined as experiencing forest loss when the pixel category changes from undisturbed in year t to degraded in year t+1. We will assume that any pixel experiencing forest loss undergoes complete forest loss and remains unforested for the remainder of the study period. We will not consider forest gain in our calculations of deforestation rates as areas of forest gain in the focus regions are much smaller than those of forest loss. 
> Analyses
> Mapping of staple crop type and productivity
> We will employ remote sensing, deep/machine learning, and on-ground data collection to develop field-scale maps of cropped area and yields for staple crops (cassava, millets, rice, sorghum, yams) within the focus regions. 
> Automated field delineation: Training/validation data of field boundaries will be manually delineated using an existing QGIS labelling platform developed by co-PI Davis. This work is already underway. Locations of data collection will employ a stratified sampling that accounts for cropping intensity and agro-ecological zones. These data will be used to train and test deep learning convolutional neural networks to classify pixels in 3 meter cloud-free composite Planet imagery3 into three categories: field edge; field interior; non-field. Pixels classified as field edge and interior will be merged with the vectorized output of a 5-step image segmentation process: 1) apply a meanshift algorithm to identify edge features; 2) segment the edge image using segment sizes finer than the expected field size (~1 ha); 3) merge resulting polygons based on mean normalized band values; 4) intersect merged polygons with classified field interior map to retain crop fields; and 5) refine and smooth crop field polygons. These steps will produce polygonized representations of individual fields.  
> Machine Learning Pipeline for Crop Type Ground-Truth Labels: In-country data gathering will collect ground-truth labels for crop type mapping in each field. We will use the Street2Sat pipeline4 – developed by project collaborators at NASA Harvest – to convert georeferenced GoPro images into georeferenced labelled (crop-specific) point samples. Coordinating with NASRDA and IITA, data will be collected using roof-mounted GoPro Hero 8 cameras facing orthogonal to the drive direction. Within each GoPro image, individual plants will be assigned crop-type-specific bounding boxes via object detection (trained using manually labelled images). Combining information on the focal length of the image with the heights of the bounding box, image, sensor, and crop (determined based on crop type and growing stage), we will then calculate a depth (from the camera to the bounding box of an individual plant) and average the depths of all bounding boxes of the same crop type to determine a single field depth. The compass direction that the image was taken is determined using the velocity vector of the drive data set. Combining information on field depth and image direction then allows the GPS coordinates of the vehicle image to be offset into the field. This crop type ground-truth data will be combined with field-delineated cropland maps (developed above) and seasonal median composite images for each band of Planet imagery and Sentinel 1 & 2 imagery and input into a Random Forest and Neural Network classifiers to assign a crop type to each individual field.
> Field-scale yield modelling under current and future climate: Staple crop yields will be estimated following the protocol co-developed by NASRDA and the China National Space Administration. Ground-truth productivity estimates are collected using handheld georeferenced smartphones equipped with a custom app to photographically evaluate crop status. Spatial yield estimates will be developed using statistical and process-based crop models taking into account crop type, soil characteristics, climate conditions, CO2 fertilization, and management practices. In collaboration with the GGCMI (Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison) Project, these models will also be used to evaluate changes in productivity under a suite of future climate scenarios. 
> Random forest and cross-validation
> We applied a random forest machine learning algorithm to evaluate the correlation between annual rates of cropland expansion/abandonment (by crop type) and a suite of climate variables. Random forest is a non-parametric statistical method that uses decision trees to perform regressions or classifications and is robust to overfitting (Breiman, 2001). This method has been previously applied in the analysis of agricultural outcomes (including planted area) in association with climate variables (Vogel et al., 2019; Hoffman et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2023). All data will be randomly partitioned into an 80% and 20% split for training and validation. Hyperparameters (i.e., the number of trees to build, maximum depth of the tree, minimum leaf node size, and number of features to use for splitting) used in each model were tuned based on a grid search approach (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). To estimate and compare the cropland change variance explained by climate variables, we will calculate R2 values from cross-validated predictions. 
> Mixed effects regression modelling of association between cropland expansion/abandonment and child diet diversity
> Using multilinear mixed effects regression models, we will assess the relationship between cropland expansion and IDDS, while controlling for multiple agroecological, geographic and socioeconomic variables that are known to influence diet diversity (Equation X). We will use the survey years as random effects in our model. This will enable us to evaluate whether climate-associated changes in cropland are associated with changes in rural diet diversity.

> WP3. Climate change effects on fisheries (Lead: IMR, CRODT) (1.5 pg.)
> The primary goal of WP3 is to comprehensively map and characterize the historical, current, and anticipated impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and fishing. This involves a thorough assessment of the consequences of ocean warming, deoxygenation, and acidification on fish stocks, and fisheries, which serve as a crucial source of micronutrients for human consumption.fisheries and nutritional resources.
> 
> 
> In addition to increases in mean sea temperature, globally by 0.88°C since before the Industrial Revolution, extreme events are expected to become more frequent. Marine heat waves are episodes of sharp increases in ocean temperature. Intensity, duration and geographical scope can be very different, but they have the potential to have a large (negative) effect on organisms and ecosystems.
> 
> The ongoing increase in concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere affects the acidity of seawater, which generally reduces the pH and saturation state of carbonate minerals (aragonite and calcite). Such changes in ocean chemistry are potentially a major challenge for several forms of marine life, potentially affecting fisheries. Further, model results and observations show that global warming leads to an expansion of the ocean areas with low oxygen or total oxygen deprivation. Accordingly, the volume of habitats for organisms like fish that depend on oxygen will shrink.
> 
> As a consequence, many marine species across various groups have since about 1950 undergone shifts in geographical range and seasonal activities in response to especially ocean warming and biogeochemical changes, such as oxygen loss, to their habitats (high confidence). This has resulted in shifts in species composition, abundance and biomass production of ecosystems, from the equator to the poles. Altered interactions between species have caused cascading impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning. In some marine ecosystems species are impacted by both the effects of fishing and climate changes (IPCC SROCC 2019.
> 
> In addition, WP3 will examine the repercussions on small-scale fishers, food security and nutrition, and aligning these analyses with the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project will include a forward-looking analysis, projecting fish production, stock and distribution, fish consumption, and health conditions up to the year 2050 under various climate change scenarios.

> Individuals make food production, consumption, and trading decisions subject to considerable uncertainty – both in terms of the biological environment (rainfall, adverse weather conditions, pests and diseases) as indicated in WP2 and WP3, and in terms of the economic environment (volatile and too high prices, availability of goods and services). To fully examine the economic and social impacts, and health consequences of climate change on Nigeria’s and Senegal’s populations, we will study in WP4 both the current and prospective economic feasibility of the fishing sector in Senegal and agricultural crop production in Nigeria taking into account the boundaries of their ecosystems, as well as the characteristics of the consumption of fish in Senegal and agricultural crops in Nigeria under different climate change scenarios. 
> The main objectives of this Work Package 4 are: 
> 1)	To develop two bioeconomic models to analyze how fishers and farmers maximize net economic yield while maintaining sustainable ecological yield, and how such decision making could be affected by climate change. We will also take into account how climate change can affect the use of inputs of production. We will pay special attention to staple food (agricultural crops and fish species) that are crucial for the nutrition needs in these countries.
> 2)	To study both the characteristics of and contributing factors (market prices, household incomes) to the current and prospective consumption of both fish and staple agricultural crops in Senegal and Nigeria, respectively.
> 3)	To measure the welfare effects on (agricultural and fisheries) producers and consumers (of agricultural products and fishes) when prices and production in the respective sectors change unfavorably as a result of climate change.
> 4)	To conduct an econometric analysis and test our theoretical bioeconomic models using data that will be provided by WP2 and WP3 (e.g., fish and staple crop prices, fish stocks, fish landing/catch, agricultural crop production, costs of the fishing and agriculture activities, and environmental variables (related to climate change)), and measure the degree by which climate change could affect the typical farmer in Nigeria and the typical fisher in Senegal.
> The results of the economic analysis of this WP4 will be useful for WP5 to determine whether the demand and basic nutrition needs (e.g., in accordance to the suggestions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)) of the Senegalese and Nigerian populations are met and will be met over time, and consequently how their populations’ health will be impacted.
> Our bioeconomic analysis of fish harvesting will provide both an optimal catch target and a framework that could help to i) overcome overharvesting in light of climate change impacts, and be guide toward optimal catches that are required for stock rebuilding; and ii) reverse potential negative rents or profits by evaluating their production operations. We will include the influence of existing policies to mitigate and adapt to the climate change effects, quota constraints, subsidies, and financial market constraints. We will also analyze with our bioeconomic modeling the optimal management of crop production, and the impacts that climate change can have. 
> We will consider: a) a static bioeconomic model; and b) a dynamic bioeconomic model. The static and dynamic models simultaneously optimize both environmental and economic goals of the small-holders (fishers and farmers). The dynamic model will however optimize revenues of the small-holder taking into account that the different biophysical and economic aspects of the farmers and fishers in one year determine production and revenues in the following years.
> We will also determine whether there are consumption-production gaps, by considering not only the sustainability, profitability and productivity of the fishing and agricultural sectors but also the patterns of and contributing factors to the consumption of fish and staple crops, and make projections of possible gaps over the short-run (2 years) and long-run (2050). We will conduct:
> a)	Estimation of the short- and long-run income elasticities of demand for staple food, and determine how responsive is this demand to changes in income at the household level, especially for lower income groups. We will account for the effects of urbanization. The long-run income elasticities will allow us to project the long-run demand for staple food consumption, and evaluate whether this is met and will be met by the current and future production.
> b)	Estimation of the responses of staple food consumption to price changes, and analyze to what degree staple food price rises would reduce staple food consumption across income groups. Staple food production could decrease due to climate change, and cause price rises.
> We will use and analyze all available local data and survey data (e.g., Demographic Health Service (DHS)), on staple food from different demographic, economic and social groups. Any possible gap on consumption data, will be complemented by using the actual fish harvesting and agricultural production, and the distribution across local and international markets, to estimate the potential consumption across difference demographic, social and economic groups, using the methodology of Deaton and Zaidi (2002), FAO (2017) and Kébé (1998).

>  Other evidence suggests that urbanization also increases fish consumption and staple crops through changing preferences. The estimation of the long-run income elasticities will allow us to project the long-run demand for fisheries and agricultural crops consumption, and consequently evaluate whether consumption for fisheries and agricultural staple crops are currently met and whether will be met given the current and future fish and crop production (obtained from our bioeconomic modeling), respectively.

> WP5. Nutrition Gap and Health Evaluation and Risk Analysis (Lead:   UD) (1.5 pg.)
> 
> Food security and nutrition (FSN) depends upon both the availability, access, and utilization (nutritional quality) of food (HLPE 2020). The outcomes of WP4 will provide information about the nature of the market basket of goods consumed by vulnerable communities in Nigeria and Senegal, along with their embedded nutritional content from WP2 and WP3. This WP will analyze the impacts of the current  staple food consumption on the  health of these countries’ populations. Reduction in food wastage will also be considered within this context. With perishable items that cannot be retrieved, a circular economy for biomass conversion to fertilizer or energy should also be an option. The University of Delaware’s plan to develop a sustainable development hub for a circular food economy would be an important support mechanism for this project. 
> 
> We will blend literature-based nutrition gap approaches with empirical approaches to estimate health outcomes. To do so, we will look at three levels of health outcomes: (Level 1) food quality and nutritional content; (Level 2) nutritional deficiencies; and (Level 3) morbidity and mortality. Level 1 simply describes the market basket in terms of its calories and nutrients. Level 2 compares level 1 to nutrient needs and accounts for variability, dietary supplements, and poisoning risk, and looks at outcomes such as micronutrient deficiencies. Level 3 looks at how these nutrition gaps translate into anthropometry, capturing stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and underweight (low weight for age) outcomes, and illness, such as diarrhea, anemia, malaria, heart disease, as well as childhood mortality.
> 
> Levels 2 and 3 can be studied through either literature-based approaches, drawing upon previously established relationships (e.g., Black et al. 2008, Green et al. 2016, Aboagye et al. 2021), or new multivariate regression analysis. Estimating a statistical relationship between nutrition intake and health outcomes is challenging because of the endogenous role of poverty. However, our approach provides the instrumental variables necessary for exposing the true risks driven by food production and nutrition. Using data from the Demographic Health Survey, we will develop new econometric relationships between Level 3 health outcomes as a function of Level 2 nutrition and Level 1 food access. Then we will compare these to literature-based estimates, evaluating the source of discrepancies. The table below shows some key relationships of interest:
> Food Access (Level 1)
> Nutritional Deficiency (Level 2)
> Health Outcome (Level 3)
> Comparison
> Daily calorie intake
> Undernutrition
> Stunting
> 44% reduction / 100 kcal (Green et al. 2016)
> Dietary diversity
> Malnourishment
> Wasting
> 13% reduction for adequate diversity (Aboagye et al. 2021)
> Fish consumption
> Vitamin A deficiency
> Increased risk of death
> 6.5% of deaths under 5 (Black et al. 2008)
> 
> Concretely, we will regress health outcomes (such as stunting prevalence) directly on food access measures (such as daily calorie intake), using data from DHS, as well as instrumenting food access using food production from WP4.
> 
> The use of both literature-based and statistical approaches across these three cumulative levels provides multiple supporting lines of evidence for evaluating health issues. The synthesis of these lines of evidence will be an opportunity to incorporate other key aspects of the food system that are otherwise outside of the scope of the new analysis, including: aquaculture, livestock, and the role of fortification programs. Seasonal and unexpected variability in nutrition also plays a key role in determining health outcomes.
> 
> We can further refine our identification of at-risk populations, by accounting for food availability and poverty (WP4) and household features (DHS). Human health outcomes can depend on, e.g., age and gender (demographic characteristics), health status, socio-economic conditions (including worker environments and labor conditions), adaptation policies, and the functioning of food and health systems. When such a data on consumption are not available, we will use the actual fish harvesting and agricultural production, and their market distribution (both local markets and exports), to estimate the potential consumption across difference demographic, social and economic groups, using the methodology of Deaton and Zaidi (2002), FAO (2017) and Kébé (1998).
> 
> Nutritional deficiencies also have long-term consequences, e.g., on future health and income (Victora et al. 2008).
> 
> Finally, we will translate health risk estimates into (1) general policy recommendations and (2) metrics shared through the Food Security Futures Explorer. These outputs will be developed in consultation with the stakeholder groups under WP1.

> 
> NOWASTING is a stakeholder-driven project, aimed at supporting small-holder farmers and fishers with salient data, accessible tools, and local capacity-building. The core stakeholder engagement activities will take place under WP1, and are described there. This document will focus out the outcomes envisioned from these meetings and the broader community engagement associated with the work. The aim is to address producer behaviors and co-develop new adaptation practices through decision-science approaches.
> Tools and Dataset Development (Lead: UD) (1 pg)
> All of the results produced by the project will be made available online, as downloadable datasets and visualizations. This will include: (1) spatiotemporal climate projections for the co-designed scenarios; (2) effects of climate change on the crop suitability and productivity; (3) effects of climate change on fisheries productivity (4) effects of climate change on the composition and abundance of fish species and agricultural crops, and the consequences for the consumption and nutrition content of such food production; (5) projections of food production and local food availability across different socioeconomic and climate scenarios; (6) measuring possible nutrient gap or degree of suboptimal dietary intake of key nutrients for the average Senegalese and Nigerian household (according to income, region); (7) the welfare effects on (agriculture and fish) producers and consumers (of agricultural products and fishes) when harvesting, revenues, prices and product nutrition values in the respective sectors are adversely affected by climate change; and (8) potential future health outcomes from changes in nutrition patterns and under multiple public health responses. Future projections will be made at high resolution and through 2050.
> As part of this project, we aim to have thorough data collection and organization that we use in our research analysis, and provide ocean observations at the largest possible scale to effectively understand marine conservation. Ocean observations are crucial for informing vulnerable populations about how their livelihoods can be affected (directly and indirectly) by the increasing pressures facing the oceans. This will be also useful for contributing further the relevant stakeholders’ abilities to predict and adapt to such pressures, especially those caused by climate change and human activity.
> 
> Because of the many dimensions of this data, users need tools to explore and understand it. The Food Security Futures Explorer will be the central tool for sharing data and visualizations, and will feature interactive tools to engage a broader audience and inform policy and behavior. The interface will be co-created to support stakeholders in developing resilience to production, nutrition, and health risks. The tool will contain extensive information about adverse environmental changes to serve as an early warning system and for evaluating stakeholder adaptation options. The Explorer will Integrate sustainability and economic outputs into the model to guide producers in decision-making.
> Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing (Lead: CRODT, NASRDA) (1 pg)
> 
> NOWASTING will support capacity-building and knowledge sharing under two main avenues. First, we will educate stakeholders and young scientists about the modeling of the relationship between climate change, fishery biological and economic outcomes, and the implications for nutrition and health. This will be done through workshops, training through teaching and research, and webinars at institutions in Senegal and Nigeria to share knowledge, improve capacity, and foster collaborations. This will enable communities to mitigate, anticipate and dynamically adapt to changing ocean boundaries.
> 
> Second, the project will support Ph.D. students engaged in related research.
> 
> Ph.D. students to be advised by the following (1 each):
> Ndèye Fatou Ndiaye (ITA, Senegal)
> Erik Olson (IMR, Norway) to advise Coumba Ndoffène Diouf (BAPDP, Senegal)
> James Rising (UD, USA)
> Kyle Davis (UD, USA)
> Gabriela Mundaca (UD, USA)
> 
> Third, designing a course for masters and PhD students on the basis of our research methodology and results.
> Dissemination and Policy Influencing (Lead: ITA, UD) (1 pg)
> Each stakeholder workshop will include discussions to help co-design an effective dissemination strategy targeted at policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders of interest. This information will be used to inform the online tools as well as targeted policy briefs. In addition, we will ensure that key scientific outputs of the work are published under gold and green open-access pathways.
