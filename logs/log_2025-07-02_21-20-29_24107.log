> Executive Summary
> Climate change is accepted as a major issue for Bangladesh due its extreme
> environmental vulnerability to climate hazards irrespective of climate change. It has
> a well-established scientific community addressing the issue, and was an early
> mover in the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) process. Since then
> (1995) there have been a series of policy and institutional changes undertaken by
> the Government. There is a widespread awareness about the inter-relationship of
> climate change and development, and the dangers that climate change poses for its
> economic growth, with a study recently completed about the costs for critical coastal
> infrastructure and other key developments. Bangladesh has increasingly become a
> significant player in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
> (UNFCCC) negotiations as a Least Developed Country (LDC) with special status and
> with moral voice. It can expect additional funding as an LDC and has already
> received some EU fast start funds.
> This report presents the findings of the case study on Bangladesh within the
> European Development Cooperation to 2020 (EDC 2020) project1
> , which investigates
> the links between development cooperation and climate change strategies in
> developing countries up to 2020. The objective of the case studies (the other being
> in Indonesia) is to understand the existing and future evolution of climate finance at
> the national level, and to provide insights on the synergies and conflicts which have
> been examined at EU and international levels in the project. The provision of funding
> is a major issue for the post Kyoto climate deal with many countries active on the
> matter, including Bangladesh. However, policy analysis has been focusing on the
> international level, and there has been very little knowledge and understanding
> shared about the particular situations in individual countries. Further, at country
> level it is possible to examine carefully how climate funding interacts with longer
> established development efforts.
> Two main sources of knowledge have been used to compile the detailed information
> base on Bangladesh: a review of existing information from written reports and other
> literature and web-based material, and primary information collected through
> individual meetings with key Government of Bangladesh (GoB) officials, donors,
> policy institutes and selected NGOs.
> Delivery of climate finance in Bangladesh
> Contested issues in the past three years between the GoB and NGOs on one side
> and donors and the World Bank on the other have meant there are now two trust
> funds, one funded by the GoB (the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund - BCCTF)
> and the other funded by several donors (the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience
> Fund - BCCRF). There are also two multi-donor programmes on climate change. One
> which is part of the World Bank‟s Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR), the
> Bangladesh Special Programme for Climate Resilience (BSPCR). A second phase of
> the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP) has started (2010),
> 1 http://www.edc2020.eu/4.0.html
> 6
> which includes some activities on climate change. Each funding mechanism draws on
> different funding routes. Obviously, the proliferation runs contrary to the principles
> of harmonisation and alignment in the aid effectiveness agenda. For those who have
> created them, the mechanisms are perceived to have different functions, be closely
> aligned and be complementary. Organising the institutional arrangements and
> getting buy-in from key parties has taken considerable time. Considerable effort has
> been expended to get good matching. On the positive side there is now a strong
> base of resource commitment to get action going. And, there is a widespread
> expectation that there will be convergence by 2020, with climate change as an
> embedded development issue. From the outside it is not clear yet how each will be
> differentiated coherently in terms of action on the ground.
> Whilst the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) does
> provide an overall framework for action on adaptation, it is not a costed and
> sequenced delivery framework. That is why the integration of climate change into
> the annual five year and longer term development planning process is so vital to
> provide this planning framework.
> This is especially important as external assistance is likely to be only part of the
> story. An important assessment has been made of the impact of climate change on
> the Annual Development Plan (ADP) of Bangladesh2. This shows that, in a typical
> year, the GoB spends nearly $4.7bn dollars in development projects in its eight
> sectors (including the block allocation for local governments). Of them, it has been
> estimated that around $2.7bn of investment is now at risk due to climate change.
> These figures dwarf what is currently being mobilised for climate funding by donors
> (c$230mn).
> Interface between development cooperation and climate finance in
> Bangladesh
> Climate change needs to be seen as part of the bigger picture on development at all
> scales, and it presents new challenges on coordination and capacity. It is very
> difficult to ascertain who is doing what and where, and databases will need to be
> improved to cope with new requirements for Monitoring, Reporting and Verification
> (MRV under the UNFCCC). Within the EU and some member states, climate change
> programmes are impacting on spending on the environment and there is some
> confusion about how far climate change should be handled separately in view of its
> close relationship with long-established investments on agriculture, food security
> and livelihoods, and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). Climate change is changing and
> modifying the development cooperation agenda in several ways:
> Evolutionary approaches - some donors are evolving their development
> portfolios to accommodate climate change
> Step change with response to international political developments: as a

> Response to country drivers - increased activity by the GoB in addressing
> climate change is prompting donors to align their development work
> Response to donor country politics – the way that climate change is being
> handled by each development partner reflects the extent to which the
> donor Government works bilaterally or multi-laterally
> There are two main aspects of climate change that make it a challenge for
> governments and donors:
> Scale of funding required and the innovation challenge
> Capacity and coordination challenges that relate to the cross-cutting
> dimension
> Yet, despite its increasing profile and visibility in some spheres, climate change still
> barely features on donors‟ websites and spend is generally low, with few
> development partners yet committing significant funds to the issue, the UK being
> one exception. As a cross-cutting issue, which is being resourced in a number of
> ways, handling the coordination demands is a challenge for all players. For the GoB,
> it is generally recognised that there is a need to increase awareness and
> understanding of climate change in all key ministries. Capacity constraints are also
> evident in donors and NGOs.
> European development cooperation: issues for 2020
> The European Union (EU) has stepped up and climate change has become an
> increasingly important component of its development cooperation effort. Its systems
> have shown signs of enabling flexibility in the case of Bangladesh where direct
> budget support on the environment is not taking place. However the EC itself is a
> relatively small player on climate change funding in the country, with few member
> states active in the country.
> The next round of the international aid effectiveness process (Paris Declaration) is
> prompting policy renewal in Brussels. This is also recognising increased pressures
> from the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) process for more
> impact on policy alleviation at the same time as there is likely to be increased
> pressure on country aid budgets. Within Bangladesh there is currently a backlog of
> aid for disbursement. Capacity enhancement could further improve financial
> management systems, and could mean there would be greater confidence and less
> fiduciary risk for the EU. If increased investments are to be made for climate change
> it is vital that the EU further supports the GoB in these areas. This would be a
> medium term strategy to adopt, which would benefit the utilisation of climate
> finance in due course.
> Collectively, the EU is a major player in the Fast Start Funding (FSF). However,
> member states and the European Commission (EC) are interpreting what can be
> designated FSF in different ways, and this relates to the fundamental “new and
> 8
> additional” issue within the UNFCCC. Various analyses have probed on this issue and
> shown what a wide range of interpretations are possible. It is evident that there is a
> need for some consistency, so there is predictability for Bangladesh. It is vital this is
> pursued within the context of the MRV discussions in the UNFCCC. In the meantime
> the collective branding of different EC and member states approaches was effective
> at Cancun.
> In summary, several policy drivers from within the country and external to it will
> impact on the way that climate change finance evolves:
> Changes in the way EU development and climate finance evolve and relate to
> each other
> What happens to the MRV of FSF and how the EU defines “new and
> additional”.
> Whether the aid effectiveness process in Bangladesh will take root with
> improvements to project management and financial management capacity
> and the coordination of effort on climate change
> Whether development partners, particularly the EU and its member states,
> seek to consolidate and rationalise their climate assistance
> The extent to which the issue of poor people, as opposed to poor countries,
> increases in significance within the UNFCCC.
> The level of economic development in the country and progress towards
> Middle Income Country (MIC) status. Further, currently large MICs with many
> millions of poor people may start to capture new and additional funds
> generated for climate change to the detriment of the smaller countries.
> Conclusions
> For the government and development partners there is a now a combination of
> circumstances that means this is a pivotal moment to ensure that the financing of
> climate change adaptation in Bangladesh gets established institutionally and starts
> to deliver a coherent pipeline of projects that are implemented on the ground. But,
> unless the GoB and development partners step up together to act, there is a danger
> that momentum will dissipate and efforts continue to fragment. Implementation and
> delivery should be the new focus for effort. There are new sets of implementation
> challenges for Bangladesh to handle but there is already considerable experience to
> learn from within the country from NAPA work and the first phase of the CDMP.
> There are very weak records everywhere, including development partners,
> on current and past projects on climate change and no coherence on
> modalities for data collection. There is no clear storyline on what has been
> done so far and there is a need for a clearing house (and to include
> research).
> If the monitoring, reporting and verification of climate finance is to work, it
> will be necessary to define what is climate funding and what is
> development funding to create a clear baseline during 2011 over which
> future effort can be monitored. This will be challenging.
> 9
> Relative success amongst the different funding routes should be carefully
> monitored so that good practice can be shared and further investments
> channelled in the most effective ways.
> More capacities to develop robust programmes and spend money
> effectively are needed. There is already considerable experience with
> successful development effort in some sectors that is not necessarily being
> accessed.
> There is a need for development partners and the GoB to establish
> mechanisms for prioritisation – how are development partners identifying
> their FSF projects?
> Efforts to embed climate change into the development planning process
> need to be considerably strengthened and given a higher profile.

> 1. Introduction
> Context for the study
> Providing finance for vulnerable countries was a fundamental part of the UN Rio
> Treaty (UNFCCC) in 1992. But, once the reality of climate change became clear,
> delivery became an overwhelming necessity. There has been general agreement
> about the urgent need for additional funds for climate change activities, principally
> since the publication of the Stern Report3 in December, and a financial package has
> been critical to negotiations of the post-Kyoto deal as recognised in the Bali Action
> Plan (BAP). Before the Cancun Conference, the important BASIC group of countries
> (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) emphasised that both finance features of the
> Copenhagen Accord - short term ($30 billion „fast track 2010-2012) and medium
> term finance ($100 billion annually by 2020) - must be operationalised and provided
> by developed countries4 if there was to be any chance of a deal5. The Cancun
> Agreements did incorporate into the UNFCCC process the components in the
> Copenhagen Accord with the commitment to a new Green Fund with the interim FSF
> package. Finance has been a major concern for countries of the G77 and China
> negotiating group as a whole with many individual countries also making the case
> including Bangladesh. However, policy analysis has been focusing on the
> international level, and there has been very little knowledge and understanding
> shared about the particular situations in individual countries.
> Most of the focus has been on the scale of funding and there has been little
> agreement about the sourcing of the additional resource required. In view of past
> experience of shortfalls around funding pledges and disbursements, funding was a
> part of the move to monitoring, reporting and verification of critical features under
> the BAP. Developing countries have frequently emphasised that the new and
> additional climate finance should be from developed country public finances. They
> have cited the collapse of the international finance system in 2008/9 as a
> demonstration that private finance would not be sustainable. Developed countries
> think that it will be innovative funding, linked to the private sector, which delivers
> over the long term. There have also been serious disagreements on modalities: how
> the finance should be managed and accessed, and a lack of trust about delivery with
> experience of shortfalls on commitments.
> In the build up to Copenhagen, progress was made on the concept of the FSF - the
> EU as a group and several country leaders in particular got this underway. Reporting
> on provision of and access to these resources ($30 billion during 2010-12) was
> formalised in Cancun to improve transparency. Critical dimensions of the governance
> of the Green Fund were agreed in Cancun. Little was agreed on how the level of

> Bangladesh as a case study
> As one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate risk, there has been
> an intensification of activity on climate change in Bangladesh since the production of
> the country‟s NAPA in 2005. An early connection was made to the impacts that
> climate change would make on the development effort: aid is a significant feature of
> Bangladesh‟s development spend with significant contributions from the EU and its
> member states. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
> (OECD) estimated in 2003 that as much as 50 per cent of development assistance is
> in sectors potentially affected by climate change. Due to its vulnerability,
> Bangladesh was a suitable choice as a case study for the EDC 2020 study. The EDC
> 2020 study was established just as the financial aspects of climate change were
> beginning to be defined in terms of flows, institutions and governance; issues at the
> heat of the relationship between development cooperation and climate finance.
> There were significant developments made to operationalise each of the new,
> country-based institutional funding arrangements during the last part of 2010. Two
> other developments will also bear on how actions take shape up to 2020.
> Bangladesh has had a period of significant economic development - a course which it
> intends will lead it to MIC status but over time could affect its favoured status in the
> climate world as a LDC. Currently, Bangladesh is the largest LDC and so is well-
> placed to receive further funds under the FSF mechanism. The aid effectiveness
> agenda is just starting to frame relationships and activities on development
> cooperation.
> Background on EU development cooperation and climate change
> Climate change finance is part of the EU‟s bigger development assistance agenda
> focused on poverty alleviation and the fulfilment of the UN MDGs. EU cooperation
> has been promoting adaptation and mitigation synergies in sectors (water,
> 6 UNAGF 2010

> agriculture, forests, fisheries, rural development, health, the promotion of energy
> efficiency and renewable energies) alongside poverty alleviation7
> .
> For the EU as a whole (the European Commission and member states), policy has
> been to systematically address climate change in the context of the EU‟s relations
> with international partners at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels. The EU is
> promoting a bottom up approach, which calls for the gradual integration of
> adaptation into national development strategies and poverty reduction plans. EU
> development policy is being reviewed to get a modernised, value for money,
> effective, high impact policy to encourage more inclusive growth8 associated with
> the review of progress of the MDG. And, climate change is introduced as being
> closely linked with development as it enhances the need for development assistance
> and requires increased focus on major questions such as energy access, water
> scarcity and energy and food security. Modalities of aid are also being scrutinised
> with questions about quality, value for money and impact of budget support
> increasingly being raised9
> . The EU has longstanding commitments to programmatic
> approaches consistent with the Paris Declaration.
> In Bangladesh, the EC and several member states have been active donors for
> decades and have recently taken on the climate change challenge in the country.
> Scope of the report
> The EDC 2020 project10 is investigating the links between development cooperation
> and climate change strategies in developing countries up to 2020. The Bangladesh
> case study unpacks some of the synergies and conflicts that arise from these
> overlapping processes and the implications for the effectiveness of response. The
> objective of the case studies (the other being in Indonesia) is to understand the
> existing and future evolution of climate finance at the national level, and to
> complement analysis on the synergies and conflicts which have been examined at
> EU and international levels in the project.
> Embedding climate change into on-going development is the “mainstreaming” strand
> of activity where climate change is factored into existing plans and strategies.
> Currently, there is little analysis at country level about how the two strands of
> funding will actually unfold operationally - that is development funding which is
> mainstreamed to take account of climate change and a distinct separate strand of
> funding for climate change. If the MRV of climate finance is to work, it will somehow
> be necessary to define what is climate funding and what is development funding.

> The analysis addresses three questions, with associated lines of enquiry:
> What is happening on the delivery of climate finance? How does the international
> context interact with national governance of climate change?
> How is the interface between development cooperation and climate change
> unfolding at country level? Does climate change present special challenges?
> What are the main drivers for change up to 2020? Is the aid effectiveness agenda
> likely to frame developments? How might developments play out at international
> level, within Europe, and from the perspective of governance in Bangladesh?
> The development cooperation analysis focuses on the EU and its member states and,
> where appropriate, the EC, which operates as an independent entity in Bangladesh.
> The report is structured as follows: Section Two outlines the methodology adopted,
> Section Three provides a background of the critical features of Bangladesh and a
> summary of the policy context. Sections Four, Five and Six provide the principal
> analysis of the report: Section Four investigates what has shaped the formation of

> 2. Methodology
> The Bangladesh case study was framed by work undertaken in previous working
> papers undertaken within the climate change theme of the EDC 2020 project. This
> has included an initial overview of European development cooperation and climate
> finance (Peskett et al, 2008); and a more specific review of the links between
> climate change finance and its links to development cooperation and aid
> effectiveness (Bird and Brown, 2010). The EDC climate theme has also involved two
> opinion pieces on geo-political dimensions of EU climate finance (Hedger, 2010, and
> Scholze, 2010). In addition, reference has also been made to reports and
> information produced around the UNFCCC process by parties, and associated
> groups, for example the UN High level Advisory Group on Finance (AGF) 2010.The
> Cancun Agreements are also related to future developments.
> Two main sources of knowledge have been used to compile the detailed information
> base on Bangladesh: a review of existing information from written reports and other
> literature and web-based material and primary information collected through
> individual meetings with key Government of Bangladesh (GoB) officials, donors,
> policy institutes and selected NGOs.
> In terms of the sequencing of the case study, the analysis of existing information
> was undertaken both before the interview phase, then subsequent to it as more
> relevant sources became known. The interview stage included some scoping
> discussions, which helped identify key players with the Bangladesh context. A list
> was developed of informants in bilateral and multilateral donor organisations,
> government and civil society organisations, along with a semi-structured
> questionnaire. Interviews were then carried out with 30 key informants in
> Bangladesh in November and December 2010 by an IDS researcher with expertise
> on climate finance and adaptation, with support from a local consultant (see Annex
> 1 for a list of the interviewees). In 2002, the researcher had undertaken the scoping
> of the first Comprehensive Disaster Management Plan (CDMP I) study for the UK
> Department for International Development (DFID) -Bangladesh and the United
> Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and has maintained an overview of
> developments in the country since then. In order to retain anonymity, statements or
> information provided by respondents has not been attributed to individuals.

> 3. Bangladesh background
> Vulnerability
> Bangladesh has extreme environmental vulnerability to climate hazards, irrespective
> of the exacerbation caused by increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
> Bangladesh is home to one of the world‟s largest river delta systems, it is also
> located at the heart of the active Asian monsoon region. Around 60 per cent of
> Bangladesh is less than five meters above sea level and it is susceptible to river and
> rainwater flooding, particularly during the monsoon. Bangladesh is hit by a severe
> cyclone every three years, either before or after the monsoon, creating storm surges
> that are sometimes in excess of ten meters: Bangladesh is on the receiving end of
> about 40 per cent of the impact of total storm surges in the world. Crops and the
> livelihoods of the rural poor in low-lying coastal areas are also devastated by saline
> water intrusion into aquifers and groundwater and land submergence. In addition,
> seasonal droughts occasionally hit the north-western region. Given high population
> density of almost 970 people per square kilometre, large segments of the population
> will be at risk.
> This vulnerability has meant that the academic community and activists engaged
> early in the international climate change collaborations on science (IPCC) and the
> UNFCCC, and brought back and disseminated information back home11. However,

>  Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) (2009)
>  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (2009 – 2011)
>  Upcoming 6th Five Year Plan (FYP) (2011 – 2015)
>  Climate Change Unit in Ministry of Environment & Forests
>  Climate Change Cells in relevant ministries
>  Climate Change Trust Fund by GoB
> The GoB launched the NAPA in 2005, which identified 15 priority activities, including
> general awareness raising, capacity building, and project implementation in
> vulnerable regions, with special focus on agriculture and water resources. The NAPA
> was further updated in 2009 and identified 45 adaptation measures with 18
> immediate and medium term adaptation measures. However, an evaluation of the
> NAPA process in Bangladesh found that the technical legacy of the NAPA process is
> recognised in the high-level planning arena only15

> made to increase capacity on climate change in the country starting with the
> establishment of the Climate Change cell under the CDMP in 2003 and this was
> renamed the Climate Change Unit in 2008. The GoB prepared the Bangladesh

> 4. Delivery of climate finance in Bangladesh: multilateral perspectives
> This section gives an overview of the way that climate change finance is being
> structured in Bangladesh and what the main influences and drivers are. The key
> issues under negotiation at international level within the UNFCCC are:
> The need for a massive scaling up of financial resources
> Sources for funding to be new and additional to current official
> development assistance (ODA)
> Grant and concessional loan funding for adaptation for LDCs
> Modalities - control of the funding and access to it
> What then has shaped the formation of the new climate financial mechanisms in the
> country, what is the scale and are they accessed? This section deals with multi-
> lateral programmatic arrangements. Bilateral climate project funding is examined in
> the next section (Section Five).
> Overall framing of aid and financial mechanisms
> Whilst there is a push to get additional resources for climate change, Bangladesh‟s
> dependence on aid has declined in respect of a number of indicators. However,
> around 50 per cent of the country‟s development expenditure is resourced by aid.
> Further aid has helped to promote and finance a number of policy reform initiatives
> which have been important in supporting the economic development of the country.
> Apart for a few exceptional years, the disbursement has been much lower than the
> commitment.
> There are now increasing pressures on ODA due to the ongoing impacts of the global
> financial crisis on key donor governments, particularly in Europe, so that it is clear
> that in terms of long term sustainability of “new and additional funds”28
> , and indeed
> development assistance, the climate finance issues in Bangladesh will fall within a
> broader patterns of aid use and disbursement for donors in their countries, and of
> course new innovative sources of funding based on carbon markets or special levies.
> The framing of aid is beginning to be addressed collectively by both the government
> and donors under the Paris Declaration process in Bangladesh, and on which the EU
> is beginning to modify its development policy in the run-up to the forthcoming Seoul
> meeting on the Paris Declaration process.
> The GoB‟s engagement with the key decisions of the international Aid Effectiveness
> agenda is demonstrated by its active participation in meetings in Rome 2003, Paris
> 2005 and Accra 200829. Following the Accra meeting a Joint Coordination Strategy

> controversies about disbursement modalities, which have been mirrored within
> Bangladesh. With the establishment of the Adaptation Fund in Bali, the agreement

> Bangladesh Development Forum (BDF) a number of working groups have been
> established to facilitate coordination, including one on Environment and Climate
> Change under the MoEF. These moves are supported to various levels by most of
> the development partners. At the June meeting of the BDF, it was agreed that GoB
> and partners would work together for Cancun, and also explore possible

> Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP)
> Climate change is also being addressed within the CDMP and this work has been

> International Development Agency (SIDA), EU, and Norway- in total $70 million. The
> UNDP is the lead agency with the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management
> (MoFDM). The primary objective of CDMP was to strengthen the capacity of the
> Bangladesh disaster management system to reduce unacceptable risks and improve
> response and recovery activities
> Climate change was one of the components of the first CDMP (Component 4b) which
> aimed to establish a mechanism that facilitated management of long term climate
> risks and uncertainties as an integral part of national development planning. This
> increased the effectiveness of responses during both „normal‟ time and emergencies.
> The climate component focused on three critical areas: Building the capacity of
> MoEF/DoE to coordinate and mainstream climate change issues in development
> activities, strengthening existing knowledge and information accessibility on impact
> prediction and adaptation to climate change and awareness-raising, advocacy and
> 29
> coordination to promote climate change adaptation and risk reduction in
> development activities.
> The second phase of CDMP (II) aims to further reduce Bangladesh's vulnerability to
> adverse hazards and extreme events, including the impacts of climate change. It will
> do so through risk management and mainstreaming. CDMP II aims to institutionalise
> the adoption of risk reduction approaches, not just in its host the MoFDM but more
> broadly across 12 key ministries and agencies.
> CDMP II aims to improve links with, and synergies between, DRR and CCA in order
> to mainstream DRR and CCA. This applies both at the community and the general
> stakeholder level. The links are clearly expressed in many of the activities outlined in
> the operational outcomes of the project design, as well as through strengthened
> institutional capacities.
> There is considerable learning to be derived from the CDMP, which did not
> commence field activities until 2006 as they were disrupted several times due to

> Key points
> Two trust funds- one by the GoB, the first such fund in the world- became

> Response to country drivers
> Response to donor country politics
> Evolutionary approaches:
> Some donors see their move into climate change as an evolutionary activity

> UNDP and DFID have been engaged for the longest. Their first strategy was to work

> increase understanding and capacity to analyse climate risks – to work out courses

> climate change has become an area for current, not just future policy.
> This has meant that, in some respects, Bangladesh has been further ahead with
> connecting between CDMP and CCA, for example through the development of

> Step change through international political developments
> For multilateral donors, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World
> Bank, and the International Finance Centre (IFC), the engagement process has been
> driven by a step change with revised regional and country strategies for Bangladesh.
> These have included climate change as a pillar of action, driven presumably by
> fundamental moves within their organisations to increase work on climate change,
> linked to international developments. Developing momentum first for the
> Copenhagen UN Conference and then Cancun meant that some donors started to

> is earmarked ODA above 0.7 per cent (Sweden currently gives 1 per cent of GNP).
> Previously nearly 80 per cent of SIDA‟s budget had been allocated for the health and
> education sectors. For Switzerland, climate change was not originally in the country

> Country drivers (BCSSAP and aid effectiveness)
> Donors have also responded to the internal country drivers and the GoB‟s
> intensification of activity on climate change: the production of the BCCSAP and its
> six thematic areas plus 44 programs, and the GoB‟s trust fund. All donors thought
> that the Action Plan was a positive move and that their own investments were
> aligned with this plan. Another stimulus to engagement, which was reported by
> some donors during the interviews, has been the progress under the aid
> effectiveness agenda, the Joint JCS and the increasing momentum around the Local
> Coordinating Group on Environment and Climate Change.
> Response to donor country politics
> Several donors commented that there was a push from their HQ country offices to
> be seen to be at the forefront on climate change. Some referred to duplication and
> de facto competition. Further, having established effective ways of both delivering
> impact on the ground and dealing with fiduciary risk problems by working in specific
> programme niches, there is understandable resistance to work in new ways. For
> example, GTZ has decided to maintain its existing focus and modus operandi,
> developed over 30 years in the country, on field-project-focused environmental
> activities, aligned with agriculture and rural development on wetland biodiversity
> and rehabilitation of ecosystems. It justifies this by aligning these activities to the
> BCSSAP. GTZ‟s view is that this approach is the most direct and effective route as it
> avoids lengthy consultation processes and gives a clear profile for its activities. The
> German government prefers working bilaterally, which produces more impact and
> effective change, than working through a basket of funding. If projects are
> successful they then join with partners to scale up.
> Climate change has been evolving within USAID‟s programme, as driven by US
> national policy. The USAID Mission in Bangladesh is one of the largest USAID
> development assistance programs in the world in terms of funding and staff size.
> USAID has been a development partner in Bangladesh since the country‟s

> and biodiversity, food and disaster management, with many strands of activity
> within these sectors which are relevant for climate change policy (see Annex 3).
> There is now evidence of a major re-alignment underway with climate change
> having an increased profile, reflecting presumably the Obama administration‟s

> Private sector
> Capacity issues also seem to inhibit private sector involvement, despite various

> Climate change needs to be seen as part of the bigger picture on

> Evolutionary approaches – some donors are evolving their

> Step change with response to international political developments: as

> 6. European development cooperation: issues for 2020
> The EDC 2020 project seeks to look at the period up to 2020, and to put a longer
> time frame on the dynamics of the current situation, especially for the perspective of
> European development cooperation. How then will the situation unfold in Bangladesh
> and what will be the main drivers for change up to 2020? How might developments
> at international level, within Europe, and from the perspective of governance in
> Bangladesh, play out? Will Europe change its approach to development cooperation?
> Is the aid effectiveness agenda likely to frame developments? Cancun has given new
> momentum to the agenda but there is still no agreement for long term climate
> financing so there is much still to be determined.
> This section seeks to explore these issues, in relation to the influences on and within
> Europe that will affect its partnership with Bangladesh on climate finance and
> development cooperation. This includes the formal aid effectiveness agenda in the
> country, which is starting to frame the relationship.
> EU development and climate finance
> An analysis of the EC aid portfolio shows that commitments for climate-relevant
> interventions have been globally increasing since 2002, totaling today around €2.5
> billion. Overall climate change commitments in the development portfolio increased
> between 2002 and2008 to €1.7bn (see Table 1 below). This is marked up as
> “demonstrating that a significant amount of climate change integration has already
> taken place in development cooperation.”47
> .
> It is possible to ascertain from the various communications, that the EU
> Development Directorate has continued to see climate change predominantly from
> an environmental framework. Further environment was not well covered in the
> European Commission‟s core Country Strategy Papers (CSPs). Full analysis of
> climate change from a development perspective was also constrained as a round of
> CSPs had just been completed as climate change moved up the development

> To avoid the establishment of new project implementation units.

> identified that a significant part of its portfolio contributes to climate
> change intervention strategies. Its systems have shown signs of enabling
> flexibility, in the case of Bangladesh, where direct budget support on the

> player on climate change funding in the country, with a few member

> The next round of the international aid effectiveness process (Paris

> Conclusions
> Climate change has now become an issue about implementation and delivery in
> Bangladesh. There are new sets of challenges for Bangladesh to handle but there is
> already considerable experience within the country from the NAPA process and the
> CDMP 1, which needs to be better accessed for learning. The EU and its member
> states, notably the UK, have stepped up their effort but this effort needs to maintain
> momentum to deliver an effective development partnership.
> Donors and the GoB could create a clear baseline during 2011 over which future
> effort can be monitored. There are very weak records everywhere, including
> development partners, on current and past projects on climate change and no
> coherence on modalities for data collection. There is no clear storyline on what has
> been done so far and there is a need for a clearing house (and to include research).
> This will be vital for MRV under the UNFCCC.
> Relative success amongst the different funding routes should be carefully monitored
> so that good practice can be shared and further investments channelled in the most
> effective ways.
> For all players, more capacities to develop robust programmes and spend money
> effectively is needed. There is already considerable experience with successful
> development effort in some sectors that is not necessarily being accessed.
> There is a need for development partners and the GoB to establish mechanisms for
> prioritisation – how are development partners identifying their FSF projects?
> There is a need to listen, learn and act. Many of the problems that have caused
> delays and blockages are still extant and need continuing attention.
> Efforts to embed climate change into the development planning process need to be
> considerably strengthened and given a higher profile. The EU should also act more
> vigorously to ensure the aid effectiveness process can gain momentum, and should
> support strengthened financial management processes.
> GoB needs to ensure its own citizens continue to back investments to avert potential
> failures on climate change action. GoB is an established international player but it
> needs to demonstrate good leadership within the country too.
> Development partners need to be more transparent and work to clearly established

> primarily a lender of growth promoting investment projects to providing policy
> and institutional support with an emphasis on promoting social infrastructure
> and human development. ADB plays a key role in a number of sectors which
> include energy, transport and agriculture and cross-cutting areas such as
> gender, disaster mitigation and the environment. According to the Bangladesh
> Country Operations Business Plan 2011-2013, climate change has been
> mainstreamed in all the projects and operations of ADB to mitigate the risks
> and damages from natural disasters. Steps have already been taken in this
> regard in accordance with ADB's Climate Change Implementation Plan (CCIP)
> for Bangladesh. A number of infrastructure projects with a focus on climate
> change adaptation and mitigation are now in the pipeline. These include the
> Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation Project and the Secondary Towns
> Integrated Flood Protection Project. A few renewable energy projects have also
> been undertaken such as the Dhaka Clean Fuel Project and the Sustainable
> Power Sector Development Project. In addition, the ADB also has a number of
> technical assistance projects which are meant to build capacity in the relevant

> DFID
> Apart from support to the SPCR and the BCCRF, DFID has a wide range of
> operations in Bangladesh that fall under various thematic areas such as
> education, health, water and sanitation, governance, environment, livelihoods
> and poverty reduction. Bangladesh is a key target. DFID has allocated £69m
> for its Climate Change Programme - Climate and Life which aims to improve
> the lives and livelihoods of 15 million poor and vulnerable people and help
> them adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. Components of the
> programme include providing support to the UNDP‟s Comprehensive Disaster
> Management Programme (CDMP), capacity building on climate change
> modeling through Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology
> (BUET), develop an international centre for climate change by International
> Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), etc. DFID has also assigned
> funds for a research project to develop a framework for collaboration on
> research on climate change related issues titled, “UK Collaboration on
> Development Sciences: Bangladesh Pilot Framework on Research Collaboration
> on Climate Change and the Land, Water and Flood Interface”.
> JICA:
> JICA contributes to the climate change scenario in Bangladesh through various

> - Disaster Relief after Cyclone Sidr
> - Project on Development of Human Capacity on Operation of Weather
> Analysis and Forecasting
> - Small Scale Water Resources Development Project
> - Project for Strengthening of Solid Waste Management in Dhaka City
> CIDA
> Most of CIDA's climate change activities in Bangladesh focus on providing
> emergency response and livelihoods support. CIDA allocated $10.2m to the
> Asian Development Bank for its Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation
> programme, which aims to rehabilitate and restore infrastructure and facilities
> damaged by Cyclone Sidr and the floods in 2007. CIDA also has a $5m

> Federation of Red Cross (IFRC).
> GTZ
> GTZ focuses mainly on three priority areas: (1) health, (2) renewable energy

> Supporting Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in Bangladesh through
> the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP).
> SIDA
> Nearly 80 percent of SIDA's budget is allocated for the health and education
> sector. Most of its programs are geared towards promoting gender equality,
> upholding human rights and social justice, and ensuring equity and dignity for

> Has Bangladesh been particularly effective at raising international finance?
**assistant**:
> Based on the document, Bangladesh has been relatively effective at raising international finance for climate change adaptation, largely due to its significant vulnerabilities and active participation in international climate negotiations. Here are some key points:
> 
> 1. **International Negotiations and Recognition**: Bangladesh has increasingly become a significant player in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations, recognized as a Least Developed Country (LDC) with moral voice and special status. This recognition allows it to expect additional funding as an LDC.
> 
> 2. **Climate Finance Mechanisms**: The document mentions the establishment of two main trust funds within Bangladesh—the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF), funded by the Government of Bangladesh, and the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF), funded by multiple international donors. These funds indicate successful mobilization of both domestic and international financial resources specifically for climate resilience.
> 
> 3. **International Support and Projects**: Bangladesh has received commitments from various international entities, including the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, DFID, and others. The Strategic Programme for Climate Resilience (SPCR) in Bangladesh is one example, receiving significant grant and concessional loan funding from MDBs.
> 
> 4. **Domestic and External Efforts**: The Government of Bangladesh has also shown leadership by setting aside its own resources and creating frameworks like the BCCSAP, alongside international funding. This proactive stance in policy development helps catalyze international support.
> 
> Overall, Bangladesh's vulnerability to climate change, coupled with active involvement and strategic use of its LDC status in international negotiations, has facilitated a relatively effective fundraising effort at the international level. However, challenges remain, particularly in aligning and managing the diverse streams of climate finance effectively.
