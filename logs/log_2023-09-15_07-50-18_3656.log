> Dear Professor James Rising,
> 
> I am Prince Yidana Apalazoeya, a graduate from the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR), Ghana, with a distinction honors bachelor’s degree in Natural Resources Management.
> I am reaching out to you because, I am very interested in your research projects specifically on climate change and renewable energy as proposed solutions to environmental problems, climate change inaction, and the social and environmental impacts of technology because it closely aligns with my previous research experiences which I would love to explore further through a Master’s degree in Environmental Science and Management at University of Delaware (UD).
> My interest in environmental science research was sparked during a field trip to the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. During this visit, I used a Geographic Information System (GIS) at the time to identify environmental problems such as water pollution, deforestation, and environmental deterioration through spatial data. I discovered how insufficient conservative approaches, excessive exploitation, and underutilization could impact humanity’s future on planet earth. 
> Due to this experience, I conducted my undergraduate thesis, Farmers' Perception of Climate Change in the Ayakomaso-Sunyani West District of Ghana, to learn how farmers cope with a changing climate. Through this research, I discovered how very little farmers in rural Ghana knew about climate change and the bazaar notions they had on the topic such as, climate change being God’s way of punishing humankind and that rainfall was the only source of water for crop production, thus hampering their search and adoption of more efficient solutions to tackle these challenges. I am curious to apply the findings of this study to explore more practical solutions such as education,green energy, water conservation, ecological biodiversity and forest conservation and restoration to curb some of these misconceptions. 
> 
> Your paper published in Nature Communications on “Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits” fascinated me since it used data-driven results to project the future impact of climate change on mortality rates and the costs and benefits of adaptation measures that populations are likely to undertake. I think the direct and indirect costs of mortality are distributed unevenly around the world, and extreme heat is measurably deadlier for the poorest populations of the world.  To reduce the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the benefits derived from tropics, Effective climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions require stakeholder commitment and involvement, as well as appropriate supporting policies. I enthusiastic and would love the chance to work under your supervision during my Master’s program and contribute to the development of new knowledge in this area.

> Would you be available to discuss your current research projects and the application process over Zoom sometime in the next couple of weeks? I am available on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, except from 4:00 pm. to 5:00 pm EST. Nevertheless, I am flexible about meeting outside of these times if that is more convenient for you. Please let me know when you will be available to meet.
> It will be a pleasure working with you at University of Delaware (UD). Please find attached my CV and transcript. Thanks for your anticipated response.

> Dear Prince Yidana Apalazoeya,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in my research projects on climate change and renewable energy as solutions to environmental problems. Your background in Natural Resources Management and alignment with my research experiences make you a promising candidate for the Master's program in Environmental Science and Management at the University of Delaware (UD).
> 
> I was particularly intrigued by your undergraduate thesis on farmers' perception of climate change in the Ayakomaso-Sunyani West District of Ghana. It is important to address the misconceptions surrounding climate change and explore practical solutions such as education, green energy, water conservation, ecological biodiversity, and forest conservation and restoration. Your enthusiasm for applying the findings of your study to mitigate some of these challenges is commendable.
> 
> I appreciate your interest in my paper published in Nature Communications on "Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits." It highlights the unequal distribution of the direct and indirect costs of mortality due to climate change and the importance of stakeholder involvement and supportive policies in effective adaptation and mitigation measures. I believe your passion and commitment would be valuable in contributing to the development of new knowledge in this area during your Master's program.
> 
> Regarding discussing my current research projects and the application process, I would be delighted to engage in a conversation over Zoom. I propose scheduling a meeting in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know your availability, and I will do my best to accommodate your preferred time. Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays work well for me, except from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm EST. If those times do not suit you, please suggest an alternative, and I will make the necessary adjustments.
