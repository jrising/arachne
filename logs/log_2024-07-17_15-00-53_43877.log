**assistant**:
> A scoping review is a type of research review that aims to map the key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps in research related to a defined area or topic. Unlike systematic reviews, which often focus on answering specific research questions, scoping reviews are broader and can serve multiple purposes, such as:
> 
> 1. **Clarifying Working Definitions and Conceptual Boundaries**: They help outline and clarify key concepts and definitions associated with a particular topic.
> 2. **Identifying Types of Evidence and Research Gaps**: They provide an overview of the types and quantity of available research evidence, and they highlight areas where evidence is lacking.
> 3. **Synthesizing Evidence to Inform Practice, Policy, and Research**: They offer a comprehensive synthesis of available research to inform practice, policy-making, and future research directions.
> 
> ### Key Steps in Conducting a Scoping Review:
> 
> 1. **Identifying the Research Question**: Frame a broad question to guide the review.
> 2. **Identifying Relevant Studies**: Develop a search strategy and include various sources to cover the scope adequately.
> 3. **Study Selection**: Apply inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine which studies to include in the review.
> 4. **Charting the Data**: Extract and chart key information from the selected studies.
> 5. **Collating, Summarizing, and Reporting the Results**: Analyze and summarize the data to produce a comprehensive overview.
> 
> ### Differences between Scoping Reviews and Systematic Reviews:
> 
> - **Purpose**: Scoping reviews aim to map the landscape of existing literature, while systematic reviews aim to answer specific research questions.
> - **Scope**: Scoping reviews have a broader scope compared to the more focused scope of systematic reviews.
> - **Methodology**: Scoping reviews may be less rigorous in assessing the quality of evidence compared to systematic reviews which often include detailed quality assessment and meta-analysis.
> 
> Scoping reviews are highly useful in emerging fields of research where the literature is still sparse or fragmented, helping to shape further studies and policy interventions by providing a solid foundation of current understanding.
