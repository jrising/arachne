> I have a cross-validation plot produced by glmnet in R, with log(lambda) on the X axis, mean-squared error on the y-axis, a sequence of numbers of non-zero predictors along the top, and the graph showing red dots with error bars for the cross-validation error for each value of lambda. Dashed vertical lines show the lambda for the lowest lambda, and another which represents the highest lambda for which the lowest cross-validation error is still within 1 standard error of the point estimate. This kind of graph is standard for glmnet, and may have other features that are not clear to me, or which do not have to be described as I have done so.

> **Figure 1. Cross-validation plot for glmnet in R.** The x-axis represents the natural logarithm of the lambda parameter while the y-axis indicates the mean squared error (MSE). The sequence of numbers along the top of the graph corresponds to the count of non-zero predictors at each lambda value. Red dots with error bars represent the cross-validation error for each lambda. Dashed vertical lines demonstrate two lambda values for model selection: the lambda value with the minimum MSE (leftmost) and the most regularized model such that its MSE is still within one standard error (SE) of the minimum (rightmost). This plot aids in determining the optimal lambda for model tuning and visualization of model complexity.
