**user**:
> I am trying to develop profiles of different post-phd career pathways-- particularly, those that start off with an assistant professorship at an R1 university. For each profile, I want to include some "stats", and one of these is the division of time between: research, grant-writing, teaching, advising, university service, public service, and private work (and "other" if there's something else). Here are my career profiles:
> 
> Early-career researcher (assistant professor)
> Independent researcher
> Institute Head
> Educator
> School administrator
> Government/Policy Advocate
> Public Intellectual
> Entrepreneur
> Consultant
> NGO Head
> Socialite/Science Communicator
> Industrial Research Scientist/ Research Software Engineer
> 
> Can you provide an estimate of the time requirements for each of these profiles? Can you report this as a table, with a row for each profile and a column for each of the time divisions (research, grant-writing, teaching, advising, university service, public service, and private work)?
**assistant**:
> Sure, James! But it's important to note that while I can provide estimates based on general observations and studies, these will only give a broad picture. Individual roles may differ greatly across different institutions, regions, sectors, and personal career choices.
> 
> So, consider this as a rough guideline rather than precise allocations. For example, time requirements for university service can vary dramatically for tenure-track faculty depending on the institution and department.

> You might consider "other" tasks that could fall under networking, mentoring, advocacy, public speaking, or professional development.
> 
> Also, for the "private work" category, remember that many academics and professionals do a variety of sideline projects that may not fall neatly into one of these categories.
