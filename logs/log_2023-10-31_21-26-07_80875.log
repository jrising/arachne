**user**:
> I am making a binder about my child, and I want to include the song "Forever Young".
> Do you have any suggestions for a fun font to use for the title, that is reflective of that song?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James! 
> 
> Typically, songs like "Forever Young" convey feelings of nostalgia, youthful excitement, and timeless positivity. To reflect these feelings in your binder, I would suggest giving the following fonts a look. You might find them playful, yet legible: 
> 
> 1. **Comic Sans MS** - Despite its reputation in some areas of design, it may serve well in a light-hearted, child-centered project like this one.
> 
> 2. **Chalkboard SE** - This font might remind you of elementary school, giving retro school vibes.
> 
> 3. **Futura** - It's considered timeless and represents forwardness and efficiency, fitting the theme of 'forever young'.
> 
> 4. **Cooper Black** - A fun and cheerful font that was popular in the 70s and 80s, it has a youthful spirit while still being easy to read and bold.
> 
> 5. **Baloo 2** - A charming, rounded, and playful font that brings a child-like energy but maintains readability.
> 
> Remember that the best font will also depend on other factors, such as the color and design of the rest of the binder, as well as the general aesthetic you're going for. If you need help choosing, I'm here to assist you further.
