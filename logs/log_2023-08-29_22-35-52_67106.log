> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. A section on recreation encompasses both data from a Mid-Atlantic Coastal Recreation Survey and data on the movements of Sailing boats and Pleasure Craft.
> 
> The survey catagorized activities into shore-based, surface water activities, underwater activities, and sight-seeing. Here are the items, with percentage engagement for some of them:
> Shore Based Activty: Beach Going - 92.9%
> Shore Based Activty: Biking & Hiking - 61.5%
> Shore Based Activty: Camping - 23.7%
> Shore Based Activty: Collection of non-living resources : beachcombing (beach glass, shells, fossils, driftwood) - 55.8%
> Sight Seeing Activity: Photography - 60.3%
> Sight Seeing Activity: Scenic enjoyment - 73.7%
> Sight Seeing Activity: Sitting in your car watching the scene - 39.7%
> Sight Seeing Activity: Wildlife viewing - 15.4%
> Surface Water Based Activity: Kayaking : paddling
> Surface Water Based Activity: Kiteboarding - 1.9%
> Surface Water Based Activity: Skimboarding - 15.4%
> Surface Water Based Activity: Surfing - 66.7%
> Surface Water Based Activity: Swimming
> Surface Water Based Activity: Windsurfing - 3.2%
> Under Water Based Activity: Free diving:snorkeling - 6.4%
> Under Water Based Activity: SCUBA diving from a charter boat - 0.6%
> Under Water Based Activity: SCUBA diving from shore or a boat
> 
> Another result of the survey is that Delaware respondents spent an average of $46.94 per coastal visit.
> 
> We also see the use of both sail boats and pleasure craft, estimated at over 3000 boats annually. About 75% of such boats interact with the coast or Bay, while 25% pass through deeper waters.
> 
> Can you provide a description of these different activities in a paragraph for the report?

> In the vibrant marine waters of Delaware, a diverse suite of recreational activities engages locals and visitors alike. According to the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Recreation Survey, the majority enjoy shore-based activities, with beach going being the most popular (92.9%). Also common is biking & hiking (61.5%), as well as collection of non-living resources such as beach glass, shells, fossils, and driftwood (55.8%). A significant amount of people also participate in sight-seeing activities including photography (60.3%), scenic enjoyment (73.7%), and wildlife viewing (15.4%). The surface of the water too teems with activity - kayaking, swimming, as well as surfing, which appears to be remarkably popular (66.7%). Less common, but still noted, are sports like kiteboarding (1.9%) and windsurfing (3.2%). Underwater activities, such as snorkeling and SCUBA diving are less frequent but still vital aspects of the marine recreational landscape. In terms of expenditure, respondents on average spent $46.94 per coastal visit. Additionally, Delaware waters host a significant number of sail boats and pleasure crafts, with over 3000 reported annually. The majority (75%) interact with the coast or the bay, while around a quarter pass through deeper waters, adding a dynamic layer to the aquatic recreational usage and marine traffic in the area.
