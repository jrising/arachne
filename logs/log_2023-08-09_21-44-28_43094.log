**assistant**:
> In a mathematical treatise, the assumptions, main results, and side-results are usually referred to as follows:
> 
> 1. **Assumptions** - These are often referred to as 'premises', 'conditions', 'axioms', or 'hypotheses'. They establish the initial facts or propositions from which subsequent reasoning is derived. 
> 
> 2. **Main Results** - These are traditionally called 'theorems'. A theorem is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and previously accepted statements, such as axioms.
> 
> 3. **Side-Results** - These are typically called 'lemmas' and 'corollaries'. 
>    - A 'lemma' is a minor result, perhaps customarily a stepping stone towards proving a theorem. They might seem auxiliary, but they often hold significant findings on their own. 
>    - A 'corollary' is a statement that follows readily from a previous statement. In a sense, they are bonus results that come after proving a theorem.
>    
> In a comprehensive mathematical treatise, these elements are used to formulate, explore, and prove complex mathematical concepts and relationships.
