> If I have hours since 1900-01-01, how can I convert that to a date-time in R?
**assistant**:
> To convert hours since 1900-01-01 to a date-time object in R, you can use the `as.POSIXct()` function and some simple arithmetic. First, you need to convert the hours to seconds, and then add that to the origin date, which is 1900-01-01. Here's a code example:
> 
> ```R
> # Your hours since 1900-01-01
> hours_since_1900 <- 1234567
> 
> # Convert hours to seconds
> seconds_since_1900 <- hours_since_1900 * 60 * 60
> 
> # Define the origin date
> origin_date <- as.POSIXct("1900-01-01", tz = "UTC")
> 
> # Add seconds to the origin date
> resulting_date_time <- origin_date + seconds_since_1900
> 
> # Print the result
> print(resulting_date_time)
> ```
> 
> Replace `1234567` with the number of hours you want to convert. The variable `resulting_date_time` will contain the date-time object corresponding to the number of hours since 1900-01-01.
