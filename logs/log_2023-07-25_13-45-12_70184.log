> I'm installing Ubuntu dual with Windows. I got a message that I needed to turn off BitLocker to proceed, but when I went back to Windows, it says that BitLocker is waiting for activation-- there's an option to turn it on, but not off. How can I proceed?
**assistant**:
> It is likely that "BitLocker is waiting for activation" because you have already encrypted some of your files with BitLocker. You don't need to worry about the message. Here's how to proceed with the installation:
> 
> 1. **Disable BitLocker from within Windows.** 
> 
>    Open the Control Panel (type 'Control Panel' into the Windows search bar, and click on the app when it appears). Then:
>    
>    - Navigate to `System and Security`, then to `BitLocker Drive Encryption`.
>    - If BitLocker is turned on, you'll see an option to `Turn Off BitLocker`. Click that. 
> 
>      Please note that you will only see this option if BitLocker is enabled. If it is not enabled, you can proceed further. 
> 
> 2. **Deactivate Fast-Startup in Windows.** 
> 
>    Navigate to `Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options > System Settings`. 
> 
>    Then:
> 
>    - Choose the option that says `Choose what the power buttons do`.
>    - Click on `Change settings that are currently unavailable`.
>    - Deselect `Turn on Fast Startup`.
>    
> 3. **Shrink Windows partition to create space for Ubuntu.**
> 
>    - Right-click on ‘This PC’ and choose ‘Manage’.
>    - Choose ‘Disk Management’ from the sidebar.
>    - Choose your main Hard Drive. Right-click and choose ‘Shrink Volume’.
>    
>    Then decide on the amount of space you want to allocate for Ubuntu and enter it.
>    
> 4. **Restart your PC with the Ubuntu installation medium.**
> 
>    Simply restart with the Ubuntu USB or DVD in your computer and, when asked, choose `Install Ubuntu`.
> 
> 5. **When asked to choose an installation type, choose `Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager`.**
> 
>    Ubuntu will identify the available space and install itself there.
> 
> 6. Follow the prompts to complete the installation of Ubuntu.
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to smoothly install a dual-boot of Ubuntu alongside your Windows OS. If you run into any further issues, don't hesitate to ask me for assistance.
**user**:
> The option to turn off fast startup is disabled. How do I deselect it?
**assistant**:
> If the option to disable Fast Startup is disabled in your Power Options, it might be because you don't have administrative privileges. Here's an alternative method to disable Fast Startup using the Windows Registry Editor:
> 
> 1. Press **Windows Key + R** to open the Run dialog box.
> 2. Type `regedit` and click **OK** to open the Registry Editor.
> 3. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following key:
> 
>    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Power`
> 
> 4. Look for a value called `HiberbootEnabled` on the right-hand side. If you can't find it, you may need to create it:
> 
>    - Right-click on an empty space in the right-hand pane.
>    - Select **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
>    - Name the new value `HiberbootEnabled`.
> 
> 5. Double-click on `HiberbootEnabled` and set its value data to `0`. This will disable Fast Startup. If the value already exists, simply modify its value data to `0`.
> 
> 6. Click **OK** to save the changes.
> 
> After making these changes, you should be able to proceed with installing Ubuntu alongside Windows. Remember to save any unsaved work, as you may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
