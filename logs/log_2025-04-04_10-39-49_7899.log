> Dear Theresa,
> 
> I am a researcher at the University of Delaware, working with the London School of Economics, and I have recently started some funded work with HMT on the risks of climate change and potential for adaptation. Our goal is to capture evidence on UK risks and adaptation into a tool that HMT and others can use to explore different adaptation plans.
> 
> I would like to invite you to be our representative from the Bank of England on an advisory panel for the project. Danielle Monnier at HMT suggested I reach out to you.
> 
> As an example of this group's role, one of the first meetings of the panel would be to provide input on the structure of the projection scenarios. We want to make sure that our scenarios can support work being done by other groups, including OBR, Defra, and the CCC.
> 
> The current project is just for 12 months, and the advisory group would probably meet four times over that period.
> 
> Let me know if you would be available to participate in this group, or if you would like more information.
> 
> Best,

> Hi James,

> 
> Nice to hear from you. I had heard about the project a little while ago and it’s great to hear you’re leading this work. I’d be delighted to join the advisory panel – I will need to go through the usual authorisation process within the Bank, and will let you know as soon as I hear back.

> I’m currently based in Exeter during a secondment to the Met Office, so I might require funding for travel or be limited in attending in-person meetings in London. I’m copying my MO email address as I only check the Bank one infrequently, but if you prefer to communicate via the Bank one then please drop me a line on the MO one to make sure I don’t miss any emails

> Is there is a project plan or note setting out the commission that you could share? And if you already have a sense of timings for the four meetings, or the first meeting, that would also be good to know.
