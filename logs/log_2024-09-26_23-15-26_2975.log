**assistant**:
> In the early 1600s, highway robbers, often known as "highwaymen," typically used a combination of weapons that were common and practical for their needs during their ambushes. Here are some likely options:
> 
> 1. **Daggers and Knives**: These were ubiquitous and relatively easy to conceal, making them a common weapon for close quarters.
> 
> 2. **Swords**: Rapiers or cutlasses would have been favored by those who could afford them. They provided reach and intimidation during robberies.
> 
> 3. **Pistols**: By the early 1600s, wheellock pistols were becoming more prevalent among those who could afford them. Though expensive, they were effective for intimidation and quick attacks.
> 
> 4. **Blunderbusses**: These short, wide-muzzled firearms were useful for short-range attacks and could discharge a large spread of shot.
> 
> 5. **Clubs or Cudgels**: Simple and easy to handle, clubs were used for bludgeoning and were a weapon of choice for less wealthy bandits.
> 
> These weapons needed to be manageable for mobility since highwaymen often relied on swift attacks and quick escapes, often on horseback. The choice of weaponry could vary depending on the individual robber's wealth and experience.
