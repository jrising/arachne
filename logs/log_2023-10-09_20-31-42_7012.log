> Models. A range of models is available to analyze the effects of changes in exploitation rate on fish populations, communities, and ecosystems. Exploitation rate (ut) is defined as the proportion of biomass that is removed per year, i.e., 
>  where C is the catch (or yield) and B is the available biomass in year t. Single-species models are often used to determine the exploitation rate uMSY that provides the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for a particular stock. Fishing for MSY results in a stock biomass, BMSY, that is substantially (typically 50 to 75%) lower than the unfished biomass (B0). It has been a traditional fisheries objective to achieve single-species MSY, and most management regimes have been built around this framework. Recently this focus has expanded toward assessing the effects of exploitation on communities and ecosystems (9).
> Multispecies models can be used to predict the effects of exploitation on species composition, size structure, biomass, and other ecosystem properties. They range from simpler community models to more-complex ecosystem models (12). Figure 2 displays equilibrium solutions from a size-based community model, which assumes that fishing pressure is spread across species according to their size and that a subset of species remains unfished (13). Results of more-complex ecosystem models across 31 ecosystems and a range of different fishing scenarios were remarkably similar (fig. S1 and table S1). With increasing exploitation rate, total fish catch is predicted to increase toward the multispecies maximum sustainable yield (MMSY) and decrease thereafter. In this example, the corresponding exploitation rate that gives maximum yield uMMSY is ~0.45, and total community biomass BMMSY equilibrates at ~35% of unfished biomass (Fig. 2). Overfishing occurs when u exceeds uMMSY, whereas rebuilding requires reducing exploitation below uMMSY. An increasing exploitation rate causes a monotonic decline in total biomass and average body size, and an increasing proportion of species is predicted to collapse (Fig. 2). We used 10% of unfished biomass as a definition for collapse. At such low abundance, recruitment may be severely limited, and species may cease to play a substantial ecological role. This model suggests that a wide range of exploitation rates (0.25 < u < 0.6) yield ≥90% of maximum catch but with very different ecosystem consequences: whereas at u = 0.6 almost half of the species are predicted to collapse, reducing exploitation rates to u = 0.25 is predicted to rebuild total biomass, increase average body size, and strongly reduce species collapses with little loss in long-term yield (Fig. 2). In addition to reconciling fishery and conservation objectives, setting exploitation rate below uMMSY reduces the cost of fishing and increases profit margins over the long term (14). This simple model does not incorporate fishing selectivity; however, in practice the proportion of collapsed species could be reduced further by increasing selectivity through improved gear technology (15), by closing areas frequented by vulnerable species, or through offering incentives to improve targeting practices (16). Such strategies allow for protection of vulnerable or collapsed species, while allowing for more intense exploitation of others.
> 
> Fig. 2 Effects of increasing exploitation rate on a model fish community. Exploitation rate is the proportion of available fish biomass caught in each year. Mean Lmax refers to the average maximum length that species in the community can attain. Collapsed species are those for which stock biomass has declined to less than 10% of their unfished biomass. This size-structured model was parameterized for 19 target and 2 nontarget species in the Georges Bank fish community (13). It includes size-dependent growth, maturation, predation, and fishing. Rebuilding can occur to the left, overfishing to the right, of the point of maximum catch. Three key objectives that inform current management are highlighted: biodiversity is maintained at low exploitation rate, maximum catch is maintained at intermediate exploitation rate, and high employment is often maintained at intermediate to high exploitation rate, because of the high fishing effort required.
> These results suggest that there is a range of exploitation rates that achieve high yields and maintain most species. To test whether current fisheries fall within this range, we evaluated trends in 10 large marine ecosystems for which both ecosystem models and stock assessments were available (10). Figure 3A shows exploitation rate and biomass trajectories derived from 4 to 20 assessed fish or invertebrate stocks per ecosystem. These stocks typically represent most of the catch, and we assumed that trends in their exploitation rates represent the community as a whole. Ecosystem models were used to calculate uMMSY (light blue bars) and the exploitation rate at which less than 10% of the fished species are predicted to be collapsed (uconserve, dark blue bars). Across the 10 examined ecosystems, MMSY was predicted at multispecies exploitation rates of uMMSY = 0.05 to 0.28 (mean of 0.16), whereas avoiding 10% collapse rates required much lower exploitation rates of uconserve = 0.02 to 0.05 (mean of 0.04).

> Fig. 3 Exploitation rate and biomass in large marine ecosystems and individual stocks. (A) Time trends of biomass (green triangles) are shown relative to the BMSY (green band), exploitation rates (blue circles) relative to the uMMSY (light blue band), and a hypothetical conservation objective at which less than 10% of species are collapsed (uconserve, dark blue band). In each ecosystem, stock assessments were used to calculated average biomass relative to BMSY and exploitation rate (total catch divided by total biomass) for assessed species. Reference points were calculated by using published ecosystem models; the width of the bands represents estimated uncertainty (10). (B) Current exploitation rate versus biomass for 166 individual stocks. Data are scaled relative to BMSY and the exploitation rate (uMSY) that allows for maximum sustainable yield. Colors indicate probability of occurrence as revealed by a kernel density smoothing function. Gray circles indicate that BMSY and uMSY estimates were obtained directly from assessments; open circles indicate that they were estimated from surplus production models (10).
> Up to the 1990s, assessed species in 6 of the 10 ecosystems had exploitation rates substantially higher than those predicted to produce MMSY (Fig. 3A). Only the eastern Bering Sea has been consistently managed below that threshold. Since the 1990s, Iceland, Newfoundland-Labrador, the Northeast U.S. Shelf, the Southeast Australian Shelf, and California Current ecosystems have shown substantial declines in fishing pressure such that they are now at or below the modeled uMMSY. However, only in the California Current and in New Zealand are current exploitation rates predicted to achieve a conservation target of less than 10% of stocks collapsed (Fig. 3A). Declining exploitation rates have contributed to the rebuilding of some depleted stocks, whereas others remain at low abundance. Averaged across all assessed species, biomass is still well below BMSY in most regions. However, biomass has recently been increasing above the long-term average in Iceland, the Northeast U.S. Shelf, and the California Current, while remaining relatively stable or decreasing elsewhere (Fig. 3A).
> Scientific stock assessments. Stock assessments quantify the population status (abundance, length, and age structure) of targeted fish or invertebrate stocks. We explored the status of 166 stocks worldwide for which we were able to obtain estimates of current biomass and exploitation rate (Fig. 3B). For about two-thirds of the examined stocks (63%), biomass (B) has dropped below the traditional single-species management target of MSY, that is, B < BMSY. About half of those stocks (28% of total) have exploitation rates that would allow for rebuilding to BMSY, that is, u < uMSY, whereas overfishing continues in the remainder (u > uMSY in 35% of all stocks). Another 37% of assessed stocks have either not fallen below BMSY or have recovered from previous depletion; most stocks in this category (77%) are in the Pacific. The weight of the evidence, as shown by the kernel density plot in Fig. 3B, indicates that most assessed stocks have fallen below the biomass that supports maximum yield (B < BMSY) but have the potential to recover, where low exploitation rates (u < uMSY) are maintained. Note that most stock assessments come from intensely managed fisheries in developed countries, and therefore our results may not apply to stocks in many developing countries, which are often not assessed but fished at high exploitation rates and low biomass. Full results are provided in table S2.
> When we combined the biomass estimates of stocks assessed since 1977 (n = 144, Fig. 4A), we observed an 11% decline in total biomass. This trend is mostly driven by declines in pelagic (mid-water) species, whereas large declines in demersal (bottom-associated) fish stocks in the North Atlantic were offset by an increase in demersal biomass in the North Pacific after 1977. This shows how a global average can mask considerable regional variation. Although some ecosystems showed relative stability (e.g., the eastern Bering Sea, Fig. 4B), some experienced a collapse of biomass (e.g., eastern Canada, Fig. 4C), whereas others indicated rebuilding of some dominant target species (e.g., Northeast U.S. Shelf, Fig. 4D). These regional examples illustrate different stages of exploitation and rebuilding.

> Fig. 4 Global and regional trends in fished ecosystems. Biomass trends computed from stock assessments (A to D), research surveys (E to H), as well as total catches (I to L) are depicted. Trends in the number of collapsed taxa (M to P, solid circles) were estimated from assessments, and changes in the average maximum size,Lmax (M to P, open circles), were calculated from survey data (10). All data are scaled relative to the time series maximum. (G) and (K) represent the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (eastern Canada); (H) and (L), Georges Bank (Northeast U.S. Shelf) only. Collapsed taxa are defined as those where biomass declined to <10% of their unfished biomass. Colors refer to different species groups (demersal fish are split into small, medium, and large species based on the maximum length they can attain).
> Research trawl surveys. The best sources of information to assess the state of fished communities are repeated scientific surveys that include both target and nontarget species. We analyzed research trawl survey data from 19 ecosystems where such data were available (see Fig. 1B for locations and fig. S2 and table S3 for full data set). We found that community trends averaged across all surveys (Fig. 4E) were broadly similar to the combined biomass trends seen in the recent assessments (Fig. 4A), with similar signatures of stability (Fig. 4F), collapse (Fig. 4G), and recovery (Fig. 4H) in selected regional ecosystems. Few of these surveys, however, reached back to the beginning of large-scale industrial exploitation in the 1950s and early 1960s. Where they did, for example, in the Gulf of Thailand and in Newfoundland, they revealed a rapid decline in total biomass within the first 15 to 20 years of fishing (fig. S2) as predicted by ecosystem models (Fig. 2). These declines were typically most pronounced for large predators such as gadoids (codfishes) and elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). Subsequent to the initial decline, total biomass and community composition have often remained relatively stable (fig. S2), although there may be substantial species turnover and collapses of individual stocks (see below). Across all surveys combined (10), we documented a 32% decline in total biomass, a 56% decline in large demersal fish biomass (species ≥90 cm maximum length), 8% for medium-sized demersals (30 to 90 cm), and 1% for small demersals (≤30 cm), whereas invertebrates increased by 23% and pelagic species by 143% (Fig. 4E). Increases are likely due to prey release from demersal predators (17, 18).
> The trawl surveys also revealed changes in size structure that are consistent with model predictions: average maximum size (Lmax) declined by 22% since 1959 when all communities were included (Fig. 4M). However, there were contrasting trends among our focal regions: Lmax changed little in the eastern Bering Sea over the surveyed time period (Fig. 4N), dropped sharply in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada (Fig. 4O), as large demersal stocks collapsed, and increased because of rebuilding of large demersals (particularly haddock) on Georges Bank, Northeast U.S. Shelf (Fig. 4P). These trends included both target and nontarget species and show how changes in exploitation rates affect the broader community. Published analyses of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and adjacent areas in eastern Canada demonstrate that these community shifts involved large changes in predation regimes, leading to ecological surprises such as predator-prey reversals (19), trophic cascades (17), and the projected local extinction of formerly dominant species (20). Research on the Georges Bank closed area (21) and in marine protected areas worldwide (22) has shown how some of these changes may reverse when predatory fish are allowed to recover. This reveals top-down interactions cascading from fishers to predators and their multiple prey species as important structuring forces that affect community patterns of depletion and recovery (18).
> Global fisheries catches. The benefits and costs involved in rebuilding depleted fisheries are demonstrated by an analysis of catch data. Global catches have increased ~fivefold since 1950 as total biomass has been fished down (Fig. 4, A and E) then reached a plateau at ~80 million tons in the late 1980s (Fig. 4I). Catch composition with respect to the major species groups has remained relatively stable over time, with the exception of large demersal fishes, which have declined from 23 to 10% of total catch since 1950. Composition with respect to individual species, however, has fluctuated more widely owing to stock collapses (3) and expansion to new fisheries (6). Individual regions showed very different catch composition and trends, with large- and medium-sized demersal fish being historically dominant in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, small demersals being important in many tropical areas, and pelagic fish dominating the catch from oceanic and coastal upwelling systems (fig. S3). Among our focal regions, the eastern Bering Sea showed a high and stable proportion of large demersal fish (Fig. 4J), the Gulf of St. Lawrence displayed a collapse of the demersal catch and a replacement with small pelagic and invertebrate species (Fig. 4K), and Georges Bank (Fig. 4L) showed a large reduction in catch associated first with declining stocks and then with rebuilding efforts. These examples illustrate that the decline and rebuilding of fished stocks can incur significant costs because of lost catch, whereas sustained management for lower exploitation rates may promote greater stability with respect to both biomass and catches. Part of this stability may arise from the diversity of discrete populations and species that are more likely to persist in fisheries with low exploitation rates (3, 23).
> Trends in species collapses. Theory suggests that increases in fishing pressure, even at levels below MMSY, cause an increasing number of target and non-target species to collapse (Fig. 2). Reductions in fishing pressure are predicted to reverse this trajectory, at least partially. By using biomass data from stock assessments compared to estimates of unfished biomass (B0) (10), we found an increasing trend of stock collapses over time, such that 14% of assessed stocks were collapsed in 2007, that is, B/B0 < 0.1 (Fig. 4M). This estimate is in the same range as figures provided by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which estimated that 19% of stocks were overexploited and 9% depleted or recovering from depletion in 2007 (24). Collapse trends vary substantially by region: The eastern Bering Sea had few assessed fish stocks collapsed (Fig. 4N), whereas collapses strongly increased to more than 60% of assessed stocks in eastern Canada (Fig. 4O) and more than 25% on the Northeast U.S. Shelf (Fig. 4P).

**assistant**:
> This section of the paper discusses the use of models to analyze the effects of exploitation rates on fish populations, communities, and ecosystems. It describes the concept of exploitation rate as the proportion of biomass removed per year and explains how single-species models are used to determine the exploitation rate that provides the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The traditional fisheries objective has been to achieve single-species MSY, but there is now a growing focus on assessing the effects of exploitation on communities and ecosystems.
> 
> The paper also introduces multispecies models that can predict the effects of exploitation on species composition, size structure, biomass, and other ecosystem properties. It presents results from a size-based community model, showing that increasing exploitation rates initially lead to an increase in fish catch, but after reaching the maximum sustainable yield (MMSY), catch decreases. Higher exploitation rates can lead to overfishing and the collapse of species, while reducing exploitation rates below the MMSY can rebuild biomass, increase average body size, and reduce species collapses.
> 
> The authors conducted an analysis of 10 large marine ecosystems to assess whether current fisheries fall within the range of exploitation rates that achieve high yields and maintain most species. They found that MMSY exploitation rates ranged from 0.05 to 0.28 across the ecosystems, while exploitation rates that avoid 10% collapse rates were much lower, ranging from 0.02 to 0.05.
> 
> The paper then discusses the results of scientific stock assessments, which quantify the status of targeted fish or invertebrate stocks. The assessments showed that for about two-thirds of the examined stocks, biomass had dropped below the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) target, and overfishing was occurring in 35% of all stocks. However, some stocks had the potential to recover if exploitation rates were reduced.
> 
> Research trawl surveys were analyzed to assess the state of fished communities, and the results were similar to the stock assessment findings. The surveys revealed declining total biomass, changes in species composition, and declines in the average maximum size of fish. The surveys also provided evidence of collapses and recovery of stocks, as well as ecological shifts and interactions within communities.
> 
> Lastly, the paper analyzed global fisheries catches and found that catches have increased over time, but the composition of the catch has changed, with declines in large demersal fish stocks. The paper also discusses trends in species collapses, showing an increasing trend over time, particularly in certain regions.
> 
> Overall, the paper highlights the importance of considering multispecies and ecosystem-level effects when managing fisheries, and it emphasizes the need to reduce exploitation rates to ensure sustainability and avoid species collapses.
