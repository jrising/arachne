> How can I make a vector of a value repeated N times, in Julia?
**assistant**:
> In Julia, you can use the `fill()` function to create a vector with a repeated value. Here's how you can do this:
> 
> ```julia
> N = 10  # change this to the number of times you want the value to be repeated
> value = 5  # change this to the value you want to repeat
> vector = fill(value, N)

> This will create a vector with the given value repeated N times. For example, `fill(5, 10)` will create a vector `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.
