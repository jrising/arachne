> I would like to come up with a term that means "socially" or "organizationally" but with in the sense of institutions. Here is the sentence: "A significant element of my work, both methodologically and
> institutionally, revolves around bridging gaps between the climate
> science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics to better
> understand climate risks." The word "institutionally" is unclear here, but it is meant to refer to my work helping build better institutions for doing this work, paired with developing better methods for doing it.
**assistant**:
> A possible term to use in this case could be "infrastructurally". Infrastructures are often interpreted as physical constructs; however, they can also refer to an organizational structure or system that enables something to function. In your sentence, the term could facilitate a clearer understanding of the aim to improve or develop better institutional frameworks for such interdisciplinary work. Here's the adjusted sentence:
> 
> "A significant element of my work, both methodologically and infrastructurally, revolves around bridging gaps between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics to better understand climate risks."
