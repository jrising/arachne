**user**:
> How can I make sure that a relative path is interpreted as a subdirectory of a given directory? I have an ajax command that lists the files in a directory, but I don't want people to be able to say something like "../..".
**assistant**:
> You can ensure this by normalizing the path and checking if the result still starts with your target directory. In Python, you can use the `os.path` functions `os.path.normpath()` and `os.path.commonprefix()` to achieve this.
> 
> Here's an example:
> 
> ```python
> import os
> 
> def is_subdirectory(haystack, needle):
>     # Normalize and absolute-ify paths
>     haystack = os.path.abspath(haystack)
>     needle = os.path.abspath(needle)
> 
>     # Check if the common prefix of both is equal to haystack
>     common_prefix = os.path.commonprefix([haystack, needle])
> 
>     return common_prefix == haystack
> ```
> 
> You can use this function like this:
> 
> ```python
> print(is_subdirectory("/home/james/targetdir", "/home/../home/james/targetdir/subdir"))  # true
> print(is_subdirectory("/home/james/untargetdir", "/home/../home/james/targetdir/subdir"))  # false
> ```
> 
> The `is_subdirectory(haystack, needle)` function normalizes both `haystack` and `needle`, then checks if the common prefix is the same as the `haystack`. If it is, it means that `needle` is a subdirectory of `haystack`.
> 
> **Note:** If you're working with file paths sent by a client (like in an AJAX call), you must be extremely careful. Even with the above check, you might expose system files or files outside of the web root to an attacker. Always ensure not only that the requested path is a subdirectory, but also that access to that path is safe and intentional.
