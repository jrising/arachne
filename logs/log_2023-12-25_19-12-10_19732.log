**user**:
> What's the cheapest way for a family of two parents, a 3-year-old, and a 1-year-old to visit Disneyland?
**assistant**:
> Visiting Disneyland can be expensive, but there are several ways you can save money:
> 
> 1. **Book in Advance:** Purchase your tickets in advance online. The prices at the gate are always higher. Disneyland often has promotions for multiple-day passes, and these can offer significant savings over single-day tickets.
> 
> 2. **Travel in the Off-Season:** Disneyland is busiest in the summer, during spring break, and around Christmas. If it's possible for you, plan your trip for the off-season, such as the fall or in the late winter/early spring. This will not only save money but also help you avoid the crowds.
> 
> 3. **Lodging:** Consider staying at a hotel outside of the resort. Hotels directly connected to the parks often carry a premium price. There are numerous hotels within a reasonable distance from the park that offer shuttle services. Also, consider booking a hotel with a complimentary breakfast to save on meal costs.
> 
> 4. **Pack Your Meals:** The food and drink inside Disneyland can be expensive. Plan on bringing snacks, sandwiches, and water bottles into the park. There are picnic areas outside the parks where you can go for lunch if you don't mind leaving and reentering the park.
> 
> 5. **Limit Souvenirs:** Set a budget for toys and souvenirs, as these can quickly add up. Discuss this budget with your 3-year-old to set expectations.
> 
> 6. **Disney credit card or membership club:** If you really want to save and visit frequently, Disney has a credit card and membership clubs that offer discounts on tickets, merchandise, and dining. Make sure to pay off the card balance every month though to avoid any high-interest charges.
> 
> 7. **Children tickets:** At Disneyland, children under 3 are admitted for free. So, your 1-year-old won't require a ticket.
> 
> Remember, having a fun experience isn't always about doing everything or buying everything. Sometimes, the best memories are made just by enjoying the atmosphere, the attractions, and each otherâ€™s company.
