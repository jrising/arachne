**user**:
> I am running a 2 hour session at the AEA's ASSA meeting. I have 4 talks, each with a discussant. What length of talk, discussion, and Q&A would be typical?
**assistant**:
> Typically in a two-hour session at a conference like the AEA's ASSA meeting, you could structure the timings as follows:
> 
> - Introduction: 5 minutes
> - Four talks, each with:
>   - Presentation: 20 minutes
>   - Discussant remarks: 10 minutes
>   - Q&A: 5 minutes
> - Wrap-up/Q&A: 5 minutes
> 
> This would total 120 minutes. It's important to remember to be flexible, since unexpected events can occur which might shift the timings slightly. Also, remember to inform your presenters and discussants about their allotted time to make sure everything stays on schedule.
