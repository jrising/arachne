> In this example, we loaded a sample netCDF dataset using `xr.open_dataset()`. We then used the `.isel()` method to select every 10th value along the time dimension by specifying the `slice(None, None, 10)` argument. This argument selects all values along the first two dimensions and then takes every 10th value along the time dimension. Finally, we printed the resampled dataset using `print(ds_resampled)`.
