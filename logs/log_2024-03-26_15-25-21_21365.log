> With pandas read_csv, can I stop on the first error and still return rows that were correctly read?
**assistant**:
> The `pandas` `read_csv` method, by default, does not stop at the first encountered error, but rather raises an error after attempting to read the entire file. During this process, it does not return the rows that were read correctly prior to the error.
> 
> One way to get around this would be to read the CSV file line by line, and handle any errors that occur for each row individually. This way, you can stop processing at the first error, but still have access to the data read correctly so far.
> 
> Here's a basic example showing how this might work:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> import csv
> 
> data = []
> with open("filename.csv", "r") as f:
>     reader = csv.reader(f)
>     headers = next(reader)  # get the headers
>     for row in reader:
>         try:
>             data.append(row)  # append the row to the data
>         except Exception as e:
>             print(f"Error: {e}")  # print the error
>             break  # stop processing
> 
> df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=headers)
> ```

> In this example, the `try`/`except` block is used to catch errors occurring when appending a row to the `data` list. If an error occurs, the error message is printed, and processing of the CSV file stops due to the `break` statement. The rows read correctly so far are used to build the DataFrame, `df`.
**user**:
> Great. I'm now doing this, but I think everything comes in as a string column. How can I parse numeric values like pandas would?
**assistant**:
> When reading data line by line as strings and then constructing a DataFrame, you may encounter the issue of columns being treated as strings instead of numeric types. To parse numeric values as pandas would, you can convert the columns to appropriate numeric data types after constructing the DataFrame.
> 
> You can use the `pd.to_numeric()` function from pandas to convert columns to numeric types. Here's an example of how you can modify the previous code snippet to achieve this:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> import csv
> 
> data = []
> with open("filename.csv", "r") as f:
>     reader = csv.reader(f)
>     headers = next(reader)  # get the headers
>     for row in reader:
>         try:
>             data.append(row)  # append the row to the data
>         except Exception as e:
>             print(f"Error: {e}")  # print the error
>             break  # stop processing
> 
> df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=headers)
> 
> # Convert columns to numeric types
> numeric_cols = ["column1", "column2", "column3"]  # Specify the columns to convert
> df[numeric_cols] = df[numeric_cols].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')
> 
> # Now df will have the numeric columns converted to appropriate data types
> ```
> 
> In this updated code snippet, after constructing the DataFrame `df` with the data, you can specify the columns that should be converted to numeric types in the `numeric_cols` list. Then, using the `apply()` method along with `pd.to_numeric()`, you can convert these columns to numeric types with proper handling of any errors (`errors='coerce'`).
> 
> This approach allows you to read data line by line, stop at the first error, and still parse numeric values akin to how pandas would do it with `read_csv()`.
