> I want to estimate a regression tree to describe how an output variable varies with several input variables. But I only have 9 observations, and rpart in R always just gives me a root node. How can I request a more complete tree?

By default, rpart sets minsplit to 20 and minbucket to 7. You can try reducing these values to see if it generates a more complete tree.

**assistant**:
> To extract the split values and leafs from an rpart object in R, you can use the `summary()` function on the object. Here's an example:
> 
> ``` r
> library(rpart)
> 
> # Create a sample data frame
> data <- data.frame(x1 = runif(50), x2 = runif(50), y = rnorm(50))
> 
> # Fit a regression tree
> tree <- rpart(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data)
> 
> # View the summary of the tree
> summary(tree)
> 
> # Extract the split values
> tree$split$breaks
> 
> # Extract the leaf values
> tree$frame$yval
> ```
> 
> The `summary()` function displays information about each split in the tree, including the variable, split point, and the number of observations in each group. You can extract the split values using the `$split$breaks` command. 
> 
> The `$frame$yval` command extracts the values of the response variable (y) in each leaf of the tree.
