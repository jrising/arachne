> In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle maintenance, Phaedrus is asked by a member of the Chicago faculty what his field is. I think he says "rhetroic", but the person is not satisfied because this is his subject, not something else. What was that?

> In "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," when Phaedrus is asked by a member of the Chicago faculty what his field is, he first responds by saying "rhetoric." However, the faculty member is not satisfied with this answer and asks Phaedrus to specify what his area of expertise is within the field of rhetoric. Phaedrus then explains that he is interested in the "classical tradition," which focuses on the study of the art of persuasion as it was practiced in ancient Greece and Rome.

> What is the difference between a substantive field and a methodological field?
**assistant**:
> A substantive field refers to a specific area of study or discipline that focuses on a particular subject matter or topic, such as biology, psychology, or history. A substantive field is primarily concerned with the content of knowledge, including the concepts, theories, and empirical findings that are specific to that field.
> 
> On the other hand, a methodological field refers to the methods and techniques used to study a particular subject matter or topic. Examples of methodological fields include statistics, qualitative research methods, and experimental design. These fields are focused on the methodology of research, including the tools and techniques used to collect and analyze data.
> 
> In summary, a substantive field is concerned with the content of knowledge within a particular discipline, while a methodological field is focused on the methods and techniques used to study that content. Both substantive and methodological fields are important in research and academia, and they often intersect and influence each other in various ways.
