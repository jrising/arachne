> I have a number of chains computed for a Bayesian model, and I record for each the average effective sample size (ESS) and unnormalized log probability (lp__). I would like to use this information to turn the parameter estimates into best estimates and ranges, down-weighting chain results that have low ESS and lp__. What is the best way to use this information to construct my best estimates? Is it by calculating weighted means and quantiles, and if so, how should they combine to producing the weights?
**assistant**:
> The Bayesian analysis produces a series of chains of parameter values, often through a process like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the scenario you described, it is important to note that these parameter chains aren't equally trustworthy - some might have lower effective sample size (ESS), hinting at high auto-correlation and meaning they explored the parameter space less effectively. Others might have lower unnormalized log probability (lp__), which might occur if they did a poor job fitting the data.
> 
> As you indicated, the conventional method to create final parameter estimates is to calculate the mean (which gives you the expected values) and quantiles from these chains. But you're also right in realizing that not all chains should contribute equally to these estimations. The "best" chains - those with higher ESS and lp__ - should indeed be given greater weight.

> Similarly, to calculate the weighted 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles (for example) to get a credible interval, you would essentially sort all your chain draws (from all chains combined) with their corresponding weights, and find the cutoffs where the cumulative sum of weights exceed 2.5% and 97.5% of total weight.
> 
> Note that these methods might produce biased estimates if chain weights are too skewed based on ESS and lp__. Therefore, diagnostics such as trace plots and PSRF should also be performed to assess the convergence and mixing of your MCMC chains.
> 
> Lastly, all the operations assuming the independence of chains might be inappropriate if there exists high correlation among chains. A practical way to address autocorrelation include thinning the chains, or using more advanced sampling algorithm like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo which inherently can ameliorate such issue.
> 
> Remember, some creators of Bayesian software encourage the practice of investigating individual chains, but are cautious about explicitly down-weighting or discarding them based on diagnostics. However, weighting by ESS and lp__ could serve as a more refined summary statistic when the chains are known to exhibit substantial disparities. As with any statistical technique, it's important to understand your data and model, and to question and verify your results.
