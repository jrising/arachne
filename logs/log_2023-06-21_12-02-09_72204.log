> I would like to find a clear statement to reflect a result in the abstract of a paper I'm writing. I calculate naturalized flows and modified river flows in the US. Then I look at how much they have changed since 1950. In general, I find that naturalized flows are unchanged or slightly increased, while modified flows decrease. The current statement I have is:
> "By comparing the modified and naturalised flows throughout the network, we show that over the past 60 years modified flows decrease at a greater rate relative to naturalized flows in most HUC2 regions."
