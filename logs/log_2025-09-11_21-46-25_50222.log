> Commonwealth Scholarship - Available for students from developing Commonwealth countries pursuing study in the UK, but sometimes applicable for positions elsewhere.
> Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation Scholarships - Offers scholarships for Indian students to pursue higher education at top institutions abroad.
