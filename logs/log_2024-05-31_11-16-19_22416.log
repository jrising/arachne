> A recent surge of research has developed empirical relationships that describe how economic growth is impacted by variation in weather. We provide a first meta-analysis of these divergent results, drawing upon 58 statistical models from 8 key papers. We use machine learning to develop a “best-estimate” of the impact of weather, finding that global, population-weighted growth rates were X% lower between 2014 and 2023 due to existing climate change. We then combine this with other major dynamics by which climate change drives losses in income levels: persistence of damages, sea-level rise, trade spill-overs, and additional capital loss. Combined, these suggest that the average person is Y% poorer today than they would have been in the absence of climate change, with the greatest losses in poor, tropical countries. Since 1992, these cumulative losses across low and middle-income countries total $Z, with an additional loss of $A per year.
