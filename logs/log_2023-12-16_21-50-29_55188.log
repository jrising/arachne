**user**:
> What is it called to raise your house to avoid flooding risk?
**assistant**:
> Raising a house to avoid flooding risk is referred to as "house lifting" or "house elevating." This process involves separating a structure from its foundation and temporarily elevating it, then building a new or extended foundation and lowering the structure back on it. This strategy is commonly used in flood-prone areas to reduce potential flood damage.
