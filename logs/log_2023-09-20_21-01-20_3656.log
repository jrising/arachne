> Is there a way to compare text files in Linux/Mac OS, with the following conditions:
>  - One of the files is the base file, and one a modified version.
>  - Line endings are no longer consistent between the two, but I don't care about the difference between a return character and a space.
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can compare text files in Linux and Mac OS with specific conditions using various command-line tools. One such tool is `diff`, which can compare two text files and highlight the differences between them.
> 
> To meet your conditions, you can use the `diff` command with the `-b` option to ignore changes in the amount of white space (including newlines) between lines. Here's an example command:
> 
> ```bash
> diff -b base.txt modified.txt
> ```
> 
> This command compares the `base.txt` file with the `modified.txt` file, ignoring differences in white space. It will show the lines that are different or missing in the modified version.
> 
> If you want to display the entire content of both files and highlight the differences, you can use the `--unified` option:
> 
> ```bash
> diff -b --unified base.txt modified.txt
> ```
> 
> This will show a unified diff output, indicating the differences between the files in a more readable format.
> 
> Note that the diff command doesn't consider line endings when comparing files. It treats any consecutive sequence of whitespace (including newlines) as equivalent.
