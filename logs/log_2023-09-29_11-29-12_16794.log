**user**:
> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. I have a section on beach nourishment. The data on beach nourishment only go back to 2019, but show projects along the coast and (to a lesser extent) at several points in the bay. Here is additional details on the dataset:
> 
> Beach nourishment dataset:
> Beach nourishment projects occur throughout coastal states in the United States. These projects can be privately, federally, or state funded. Material used in nourishment comes from a variety of sources (inland sources, dredged navigational channels, or offshore sites). This data set combines historical data compiled in the Western Carolina University Beach Nourishment Viewer database, as well as the National Beach Nourishment Database generated by the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association. The data contain attribute information on the general location of sand placement, primary funding source and funding type, volume of sediment emplacement (in cubic yards), length of beach nourished (in feet), and cost and inflated cost for over 2,000 beach nourishment episodes dating back to 1923.

> **Beach Nourishment in Delaware Marine Waters**
> 
> Beach nourishment, an essential component of coastal management, involves the replenishing of eroded beaches with sand from various sources: inland locales, dredged navigational channels, or offshore sites. From 2019 onward, Delaware has witnessed a continuous series of such projects dotting its coast while also noting a lesser representation on the shores of its bay. This data is part of a comprehensive set encapsulating over 2,000 episodes of beach nourishment dating back to 1923, comprising the invaluable historical data collated by Western Carolina University Beach Nourishment Viewer database and the National Beach Nourishment Database generated by the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association. The dataset provides a wealth of information, mapping general sand placements, identifying primary funding sources and types—whether private, federal, or state-funded—detailing the volume of sediment emplacement (measured in cubic yards), tracking the length of nourished beach (in feet), and delineating the cost and inflated cost of each venture. For a detailed understanding of the sources of sand used in these nourishment projects, our readers are invited to visit the section on dredging operations and sand resources in this report.
