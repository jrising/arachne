**user**:
> I would like to offer a hierarchical menu on a website. What do you recommend for an intuitive and user-friendly javascript library? I use jquery on the website already.
**assistant**:
> One of the best ways to implement a hierarchical menu in your website while using jQuery is to use a library like "SmartMenu". 
> 
> **SmartMenu** is a user-friendly, highly customizable, and responsive jQuery mega menu plugin. It allows you to create multi-level navigation menus on the fly. Here are some of its features:
> 
> * Highly Customizable: With SmartMenu, you can customize every part of your menu. You can change the font, color, size, and more.
> * Responsive: SmartMenu is designed with mobile in mind. It automatically adjusts its size and layout according to the screen's size.
> * Multi-level Navigation: SmartMenu supports multi-level navigation menus. You can have as many sub-levels as you need.
> * Accessibility: SmartMenu supports keyboard navigation and screen readers out-of-the-box.
> 
> You can find the plugin [here](https://www.smartmenus.org/).
> 
> Another excellent option is **jQuery BootNavbar**, a simple and responsive navbar plugin for Bootstrap 4 that allows multi-level dropdowns. You can find it [here](https://github.com/AbdullahFaqeir/BootNavbar).
> 
> Remember to ensure the usability and intuitiveness of your hierarchical menu. It should be straightforward for users to navigate, with clear labels and easy-to-understand categories and subcategories. Overflowing with items and levels can lead to confusion, so keep it as neat and concise as possible.
