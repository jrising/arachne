> I am trying to use leaflet to view a raster overlayed on a basemap. I've split the raster into tiles. The functionality works great in the example leaflet HTML that is generated with gdal2tiles, but my R Shiny leaflet code only shows the basemap. I use leafletOutput("slosh") and then output$slosh <- renderLeaflet({ leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-75.4110209, 38.6882882, zoom=10) %>% addTiles(urlTemplate="static/slosh-cat1/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", attribution="Flooding inunation") }) When I go to an example tile, say http://127.0.0.1:5782/static/slosh-cat1/2/1/2.png, it shows up in the browser, so I don't understand why my addTiles line doesn't work.

> It looks like the tiles are misnumbered somehow. I see tiles with filenames 10/297/630.png through 632.png, but the console shows requests for tiles 10/297/391.png through 393.png. But when I look at traffic from the example HTML given by gdal2tiles, it does get the numbers right.

> It sounds like there could be some inconsistencies between how the tiles are being accessed or generated in your R Shiny environment versus the example HTML generated by `gdal2tiles`. Here are a few steps you can follow to diagnose and fix the issue:
> 
> ### Check the Tile Naming Scheme and Path
> Ensure that the folder structure and naming scheme for the tiles in `static/slosh-cat1/` follows the expectation of the leaflet library.
> 
> ### Verify URL Template and Directory Structure
> Make sure that the URL you are using (`static/slosh-cat1/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`) points to the correct location. Since you can directly access the tiles via a browser, it usually indicates that the path is correct; however, double-check the path and the directory structure to ensure consistency.
> 
> ### Debug the Tile Requests
> 1. **Look at the Network Tab in Browser DevTools:** When you run your Shiny app, open the browser's developer tools (usually F12), then go to the "Network" tab.
> 2. **Check the Tile Requests:** Look at the actual requests made for tile images and see if they match the expected filenames and paths. This can quickly highlight if there's a discrepancy in the requests.
> 
> ### Set `crossOrigin` Property
> If you are hosting your tiles on a different server/domain, there might be a cross-origin issue. You can deal with this by setting the `crossOrigin` property in `addTiles`.
> 
> ### Complete Example with Debug Logging
> Here's a more complete example that includes debug logging, checks, and cross-origin settings to help identify and fix the issue.
> 
> ```R
> library(shiny)
> library(leaflet)
> 
> ui <- fluidPage(
>   leafletOutput("slosh")
> )
> 
> server <- function(input, output, session) {
> 
>   output$slosh <- renderLeaflet({
>     leaflet() %>%
>       addTiles() %>%
>       setView(-75.4110209, 38.6882882, zoom=10) %>%
>       addTiles(urlTemplate="static/slosh-cat1/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", 
>                attribution="Flooding inundation",
>                options = tileOptions(crossOrigin = TRUE, debug = TRUE)) %>%
>       addDebugMsg()
>   })
> }
> 
> shinyApp(ui, server)
> ```
> 
> ### Use `gdal2tiles.py` with `--profile leaflet`
> If you haven't already, ensure that you generate your tiles using the `--profile leaflet` option when using `gdal2tiles.py`. This ensures the tiles are optimized for use with leaflet.
> 
> ```sh
> gdal2tiles.py --profile=leaflet your_raster.tif output_directory
> ```
> 
> ### Check Tile Source
> Ensure that your shiny app directory structure is set up correctly, and the `static` folder is within the correct scope. 
> You might need to adjust the configuration for serving static files within Shiny, especially if the path includes `static/`.
> 
> ### Local vs. Remote Tiles
> Sometimes serving tiles from `static/` or `www/` folder requires a route by Shiny. If you are serving tiles locally, ensure the path reflects correctly.
> 
> By considering these steps and examples, you should be able to diagnose and fix the tile overlay issue in your R Shiny leaflet application. If the problem persists, feel free to provide additional code or error messages for further assistance.
