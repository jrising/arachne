**assistant**:
> Yes, you can create a marker in QGIS whose size is dependent on a field value. This can be very useful when you want to visualize the magnitude of a variable at different locations. Here are the steps:
> 
> 1. Load your layer into QGIS.
> 
> 2. Right-click the layer in the 'Layers' panel and navigate to 'Properties'.
> 
> 3. Click on 'Symbology' on the left hand menu.
> 
> 4. Select the 'Single Symbol' option and then click on the 'Simple Marker'.
> 
> 5. In the 'Simple Marker' settings, click on 'Data-defined override' button (which looks like an epsilon) next to 'Size'.
> 
> 6. Select 'Edit' and the 'Expression string builder' will pop up.
> 
> 7. Here you can make the size dependent on a field. To do this, in the 'Fields and Values' tab, double click the field you want to be your size controller. The expression will use this field's value to determine the size of the marker.
> 
> 8. Click 'OK' to close the 'Expression string builder' and then 'OK' again to close 'Layer Properties'.
> 
> Transparently, make sure the field you choose contains numeric values. Be aware that large numbers in your field can result in extremely large symbols. You might need to adjust the data or divide by a certain factor to get a reasonable range of symbol sizes. Transformers or scale methods could be useful in this regard.
