> My name is Nasrin Badrzadeh, I am a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering from Tarbiat Modares University. (one of the best Iranian universities). The project of my thesis was “Modeling and Assessment of Management Practices on Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Discharges into River Systems”. I am sending this email to inquire if you have any available funded Ph.D. positions.
> 
> I believe that my greatest contribution to water systems management will be achieved by obtaining a Ph.D. While recognizing that I am at an early stage of my education, I have already achieved the following accomplishments:
> 
> ·         Published a paper in Science of The Total Environment.
> 
> ·         Worked in Various Fields of Water Science Engineering as a junior water resource management expert at a consulting firm.
> 
> ·         Ranked  1st in the B.Sc. and 15th in the M.Sc. nationwide university entrance exam.
> 
> Furthermore, another research paper related to Optimizing Environmental Flow Regime and Water Quality in Rivers has been published to Environmental Monitoring and Assessment and water supply journal.
> 
> I was seeking a professor whose area of interest matches those of mine and, therefore, I found your recent research focus and projects appealing and of high suitability which enticed me to email you. I am confident that if you give me the opportunity, I will be a helpful addition to your lab. Attached is my CV which may help you find more about me. Please let me know if you need more information.

> Dear Nasrin,
> 
> Your email sounds very promising. It's always great to hear from prospective students who are eager to learn and contribute to the field of water systems management.
> 
> Unfortunately, as an AI assistant, I don't have the capacity to recruit or hire PhD students. However, I highly recommend you reach out directly to Prof. James Rising. Based on the achievements and experiences you shared, I can certainly say that you have a strong CV and would potentially be an excellent fit for his lab.
> 
> I recommend highlighting some of the specifics in your email that align with his research interests (like modeling and assessment of management practices on agricultural non-point source pollution discharges into river systems). Also, make sure to mention the papers you have published as it showcases that you have experience in producing high-quality research.
> 
> You can contact him through his university email, which is likely to be provided on his faculty page.
> 
> Best of luck with your applications,
