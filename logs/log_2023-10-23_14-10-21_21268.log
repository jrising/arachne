> This is usually the least well known of the variables of a fishery, and the least accessible to management. It cansome- times be estimated by tagging studies, and from time to time lots of energy goes into the effort. If we tag T fish of the recruitment age (tag part of a "cohort"), we can assume the following proportionality over the remaining life span of

> Tr = the number of returned tags over the whole life of the cohort,

> Evaluation of population sizes, N, by marking and recap- ture is called the Lincoln Index methodof population esti- mation. It seems easy. We get an estimate of actual population and of mortality at the same time. It is never so easy. The problems are: (i) both tagged and recaptured samples tend to be trap-prone individuals; (ii) the statistics for return of a very small fraction of the original tagged lot (the usual case are unfavorable (big estimator variances); (iii) the assumption of a closed population i soften violated in the sea; and (iv) tag mortality. Tags kill; there are almost no tags without some tag-associated mortality. Hence, M < (Tv/T)Y. How much less is extraordinarily hard to e s t i m a t e .
> Regardless of their practical utility, an instructive value of the
> equations above is that Y and M compete for the available stock: N= Y +M. If we don't eat them, some- thing else will. Fishers are well aware of this competitive relationship with other fish consumers. They are sometimes tempted to take such direct actions as shooting seals.
> Tags are also useful for study of population dispersal and
> migration (see Jennings et al. 2001). Fish tagged at one site and captured at another have moved by some route between
> those points. With sufficient tag returns, it is possible to reconstruct typical movement patterns. For example, Pacific halibut is a continental-shelf and upper-slope species whose eastern stock is spread around the perimeter of the Gulf of Alaska. It usually migrates downslope to spawn, and the larvae are transported north and west around the Gulf. Recoveries of tags placed in young adult fish show a general migration back toward the south and east, keeping the population from removal to the west by larval advection. In recent years, tags have become very sophisticated, inter- nally recording temperature, pressure, light levels, and other variables. In some cases, a migration trajectory can be derived from daylength changes or other data, and understanding of large fish behavior is improving rapidly thanks to this data.

> That function suggests that there should be a parabolic relationship between yield and effort: the vieldversus effort curve (Fig. 17.Sb).Such a relationship is what economists for several hundred years have calleda"Law of Diminishing Returns". Each section of the curve can be explained ver- bally as follows:
> 1 The more fishing done at low levels of exploitation, the more fish caught, but at a declining rate of increase.
> 2 Maximum sustainable yield, called MSY b yeverybody.
> 3 At large X, the population gets so depleted that fish become hard to catch and yield falls off.
> Usually much of the reproductive stock has been removed in fisheries that are well down the right side of the curve. In that sense the yield vs. effort curve is the recruit vs. spawner stock curve plotted backward.
> While MSY is part of every fishery manager's mental machinery, it is no longer explicitly used in many fisheries. It is there, however, always working just under the surface, sometimes reappearing as "reference points" in interna- tional agreements about limits to catch or effort.

> tropical Pacific was managed for an interval by an explicit MSY model, and Schaefer's (1967) analysis of catch and effort served as the basis for that management. The fishery has had several major eras. A California coastal fishery, for albacore failed in the middle 1930s, so canneries supported development of some refrigerated boats for a distant-water yellowfin fishery in t h eeastern tropical Pacific. After World War I the fishery extended farther and farther south, joined in those years by boats from LatinAmerican nations. From about 1930 to 1958 the system of fishing was to drive a
> boat next to a school sighted by amasthead lookout, release some silvery bait fish from a tank, then fish in the ensuing feeding frenzy with silvery hooks. Tuna were heaved into the boat by muscle power. Such boats were called "tuna clippers", and the unit of effort recorded by managers was the"standard clipper day", obtained from acomparison of the fishing effectiveness of clippers of different sizes. In the second era, from 1958 on, the fishery switched fairly quickly to purse seines, enormous curtains of net strung around atuna school by asmall boatdroppedoff the fishing vessel.When the free end is returned to the ship, the net is closed beneath the school by pulling in a pursingcable. Next the net is pulled back aboard with a hydraulic power block, concentrating the tuna alongside. From there they are lifted out of the water and frozen in the holds. Seiners and clippers were both working for enough years to get a comparison of their fishing power, so the unit of effort remained "standard clipper days".
> Schaefer's plot (Fig. 17.5a) of CPUE vs. effort(thousands of clipper days) is reasonably linear. He employed several approximate corrections, trying to overcome the fact that
> the fishery age structure, recruitment, a n dyield never had a chance to come to equilibrium with any given levelof fishing effort. Rather, effort increased steadily through the years. All that argument can b estudied in t h eoriginal paper.

> The plot was readily converted to a yield vs. effort curve (Fig. 17.Sb), which suggested an annual MSY around
> 200,000poundso f tuna. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission eventually enforced this as an annual quota for the fishery. Ships would radiotheir catches to headquat- ters where they were summed.When the quota was reached, a message was sent back to cease fishing and return to port.
> The third era began in 1967, when the fishery reached its quota far ahead of its usual schedule. The fishers had discovered that setting their seines around schools of por- poises would capture submerged schools of yellowfin tuna that live beneath them. There is an interaction between porpoises and tuna that is still not fully understood, but the fishers learned to exploit it. Moreover, the tuna beneath porpoises are much larger than the average in surface schools, so the catch rate, the CPUE, increaseddramatically, ruining the analysis and basis for management. The Commission more or less threw up its hands and let fishers fish until their boats were submerged to the Plimsoll line. In fact, the entire eastern Pacific yellowfin tuna fishery was subject to no limits from 1980 to 1998. At present, there is again a nominal MSY process for managing this fishery, since the treaty establishing the Inter- American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) requires it. However, entry of
> Korean and Japanese long-liners, and a much more complex scheme of fishing effort from the Americas, have made effort estimation very complex. A yield vs. effort graph for the period 1968 to 1998 (Fig. 17.15; IATTC 2000) has been developed on the basis of just the CPUE for large ("class-6"' seiners. Since those account for most of the
> eastern Pacific catch, they can represent the whole fishery for our purposes.
> Clearly, the graph breaks into two eras, before and after 1985. IATTC analysts fitted separate yield-effort parabolas for the two periods. The earlier period was clearly one of increasing effort, and while total yield remained relatively constant, CPUE went down. Once CPUE got low enough, boats were sold or moved to the Atlantic or western Pacific where fishing was better. The stock rebounded, and yields improved dramatically, soon far exceeding those of the era up to 1984, with less effort expended. Examination of the catch showed higher recruitment rates and faster growth in the later era. This change is not the least unusual; the success of fish stocks changes over time, and usually we cannot confidently identify the causes. It makes obvious the difficulty of managing by this sort of MSY analysis, which assumes that the biomass of the stock will respond in the same way over very long periods to more or less fishing pressure. Evaluation of the eastern Pacific yellowfin tuna fishery and its stockhave become so complex, the terminol- ogy so arcane (e.g. Maunder & Watters 2001), that explain- ing it goes beyond our goal in this chapter.

> fin tuna. One was for data up to 1975, anda fitted parabola suggested an MSY around 50,000 metric tonnes. However, the growth of effort did not stop at the roughly 60,000 fishing days producing that yield, it rapidly increased to over 200,000 days by 1983, leading toa yield curve peaking over 100,000 metric tonnes, and still not obviously trend- ing downward. Hilborn and Walters (1992) draw the excel- lent caveat from this that (at least in the absence of a detailed population dynamic analysis) "vou cannot deter- mine the potential vield from a fish stock without overex-
> ploiting it". Once that is done, of course, the damage to the stock, even its place in its ecosystem, may well not be repaired simply by reducing Xto the level at the apparent MSY. It is possible that no MSY will be evident fromeffort and yielddata. In the northeast Pacific halibut fishery, effort is measured as baskets of baited hooks deployed on the bottom for a day. For many fishing regions, the graph of annual CPUE vs. effort (e.g. Fig. 17.17) is not linear, but has an obvious curve. It turns out that the data in Fig. 17.17 can be fitted with a curve by assuming a constant catch of 24.4 million pounds and dividing it by the effort in thou sands of sets. In other words, it doesn't matter how many sets are put out above about 300,000, the catch is about the same. Of course, the CPUE vs. effort function is well defined, even if curved, so it can be converted to a yield vs. effort plot, which for this range of effort is a flat plateau, always about 24 million pounds. The time sequence of effort was, in fact, generated by a regulatory agency, which saw the decline in CPUE from 1925 and had the authority after about 1931 to reduce effort. In this case, CPUE was a useful management tool even when no particular MSY was specified. The agency was alsoconcerned about the age structure of the stock, which had shifted to younger fish.

> Larkin's last line shows even he thought it had its virtues. Current management techniques (and/or philosophies) include "virtual population analysis"(VPA) and "reasona-
> ble and prudent alternatives" (RPA) and "ecosystem based management" (EBM, lately rephrased as "ecosystem app- roach to management", EAM). A s u i t eof techniques for evaluating stock size, condition, and interaction with fish- ing, VPA incorporates detailed analyses of size, age, and reproductive status, and applies year-class estimates t otake account of the uneven recruitment rates among years. At least in the United States, RPA is a legal mandate to find and apply management schemes that protect stocks, protect other populations affected by fisheries, and prevent undue harm to marine habitats. Ecosystem-based managers atte- mpt to consider everything about exploited stocksand their habitat, with concern for habitat health ranking above concern for yield. The general terms of EBM are spelled out by Pikitch et al. (2004). It can at least be mandated, fi not readily applied. In all cases, the stated goals are for fisheries to be prudently managed with an eye to long-term environmental health and stockprotection. Al such efforts are made vastly more complex by their interaction with economic and political factors. In the USA, f o rexample, management is not done by scientists alone, but by regional management councils composed of stakeholders in the fishery - fishers, packers, and scientists. Both t h ecouncils and the scientific agencies somehow sustain their work despite recurring interference from the courts, which are brought into play through suits filed by environmental organizations on behalf of fish and by fishing folk trying to protect their livelihood. Thus, the complexity of the scien- tific terminology and issues and the usually strained eco- nomics of fishing (next) have become overlain by the historical arcana rife in our legal system.

> reasons for fishing at somewhat lower rates, and there are severe difficulties in realizing either MSY or the X appropri- ate to MSY. That there should be some MSY against which to design a fishery is a clear ideal. However, because there is oversimplification in arriving at the analysis, it is not a sufficient management tool. It does have many problems; prominent is the assumption that YX/ is proportional to B, which works better for some stocks and fishing situations than for others. Another is that we cannot study Yat large X without endangering the stock, as pointed out above. Then there is the assumption that the biomass of the stock is al the same, just a variable responding in a deterministic way to fishing effort. Of course, fishing usually rearranges the age, size, and reproductive structure of the stock, and substantial lag times are involved in its response to changes in fishing mortality. Reducing a stock also gives advantage to its ecological competitors, which may increase. Reversing this replacement may not occur quickly or at all if fishing is scaled back. Finally, MSY assumes the habitat is constant, supporting the stock at the same levelconsistently. Virtually every stock examined over long intervals shows that this not true, as illustrated above for the eastern Pacific yellow- fin tuna. Carmel Finley (2011), has stated well the overall problem with MSY management: "the emphasis tends to fall on maximum, not on sustainable".
> However, clear and generally correct idealizations are very valuable and M Y retains that value. Peter Larkin's (1977) "Epitaph for the Concept of MSY" is appropriate for fishery experts, but for the rest of us the idea still has some useful life:

> fishing. Thus, so long as there is a dollar, yen, or krone to be made in a fishery, more fishers will show up to attempt to earn it. Therefore, in most of the world's fisheries, the average profit is very close to nothing. This comes about as follows. The dollar (or yen, Y) return to a fishery is roughly proportional to yield (although large yield will depress prices). That is, $ = kY. Yield has a parabolic relationship to effort, or at least varies as some curve showing diminish- ing returns. So, dollar return must also be parabolicwith effort. Cost of effort, on the other hand, increases roughly linearly with effort: each additional boat costs about the same as the one before it. These two relationships are shown together as follows:
> (e.g. Hollowed et al. 1987); in fisheries these are the responses of stocks to the decadalclimate oscillations intro-
> duced in the l a s tchapter. An example was given above, the shift in CPUE of yellowfin tuna around 1985.Such substan- tial differences in stock levels and production between multi-year and multi-decade intervals occur everywhere in the oceans, to al sorts of fish. The best-studied examples are found among the forage fishes (mostly Clupeidae: sar- dines, anchovies, herrings, capelin, and others), which are subject to industrial fisheries. Bakun (Bakun 1996; Bakun et al. 2009) points out that these fish are the "waist" in what he calls "wasp-waisted" pelagic ecosystems. Phyto-
> plankton and zooplankton are usually moderatelydiverse, with many species, while the schooling forage fish feeding upon them belong to one or two species, one generally being strongly dominant at any given time. Those forage fish are fed upon in turn by a diverse range of fish, squid, birds, and mammals: mackerel, salmon, cod, ommastrephid squid, seals, terns, and whales. Thus, intermediate trophic transfers pass through a low-diversity link, the wasp waist, between more complex levels below and above.
> In temperate and eastern tropical neritic seas (out to 100+ nautical miles), the dominant forage species is often asardine or an anchovy. For example,thedominant school-
> ing fish in the California Current are usually Sardinops sagax cerulea (sardine) or Engraulis mordax (anchovy). Fish- ing off the California coast began at the end of the 19th century and became a substantial industry in the 1920s(Fig.
> 17.18a), generating good data on take. Thesardine fishery, particularly off central California, built up to takes over 0.6 Mt in the 1930s, when biomass is believed to have been 3.6 Mt, and sustained that level to the late 1940s. Then it crashed, failing to support any fishery after 1951 with biomass reaching 0.01 Mt in the 1960s. It isn't clearexactly when anchovy stocks appeared to replace these sardines, because no significant fishery for them developed until the 1970s. Development of fisheries requires not only a stock of fish to catch, but also a market and entrepreneurs to invest in processing. Somebody, or sometimes chickens, must eat the catch or convert its oil content to paint. Nevertheless, a fishery did emerge, grew to 0.3 Mt, and then crashed in two steps by 1990. To a slight extent it has been replaced since by renewed sardine fishing, but at rates probably not taking full advantage of the available stock, which is believed to be more than 0.9 Mt (down from a peak of 1.8 Mt in 2000, n o tyet up to estimates from the 1930s. ~3.6 Mt). Landings have increased and in 2007 were ~0.08 Mt off California, ~0.3 Mt off Mexico. Thus, the harvest of forage fish off California shows a series of multi-decade "regimes".
> Similar sequences have affected sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) and anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) fisheries off Japan (Fig. 17.18b), off western South America (S. sagax, E. ringens) (Fig. 17.18c) and off southwest Africa (Namibia). Al of these regions show similar fishery regime

> So long as the fishery is below the break-even point, new entrants (buying boats and starting to fish) can make a profit. Approaching the break-even point there is still a profit, but it is divided between more and more boats. At the break-even point, the mean profit is zero. In fact, many or most fisheries move about their break-even point with year-to-year variations in catch and effort. On average, the return to investment in many fisheries is zero. If a fishery were to be maintained by regulation near MSY, then too many boats would appear to take that catch, again distrib-
> uting the profit so thinly that themean would be near zero. Limiting fishing days or gear type often does this. Thus, fishers (and expensive gear) must sit idle much of the time or use the least-efficient equipment. Fishing industries regu- lated in these ways are typically low on productivity per unit capital, and labor productivity is abominable. The best solutions are franchise fisheries (where the fisher folk own the fish stock) and limited-entry fisheries. The politics of those are fearsome, but such schemes are being established in some places, notably coastal Japan, British Columbia, Alaska, and even for US West Coast trawl fisheries.

Thus, exact dating by varve counting becomes problematic below about 1100 yr BP, but variouscorrectionsgive good approx- imate dating over several thousand years. There are varia- tions in scale counts between cores, and problems for deeper levels of inadequate sample volumes (low counts and associated higher variances. However, by counting only to 10-year resolution and doing some averaging between cores, the picture emerges (Fig. 17.21) of substan- tial temporal variability in both species.

In any case, the sediments establish that regime shifts have always existed; we just see them now through the rather distorting lens of fisherydata. Shortertime series from sedi- ment under anoxic waters off Peru and Chile (e.g. Díaz- Ochoa et al. 2009) also show alternations, with anchoveta scales usually dominant, seconded by myctophid, sardine, or hake scales.
> Key factors in all regional cases appear to be differences between sardines and anchovy in respect to temperature preferences and best food-particle sizes. In the Humboldt and California Current systems, the high sardine intervals have been relatively warmer and higher in salinity, likely with less equatorward flow and less coastal upwelling, while periods of anchovy dominance have been colder inshore with stronger upwelling. Both genera feed prima- rily on zooplankton, but sardines have more closely spaced gill rakers and filter the smaller animals typical of warmer, more offshore waters. Anchovy are primarily visual particle feeders, thriving on somewhat larger zooplankton typical in colder, more productive nearshore upwelling ecosystems (van der Lingen 2006). Thus they are distinctive in both temperatureoptima and preferred food-types.T h eJapanese comparison is similar in respect to food type, but reversed in respect to temperature. That is likely t orepresent distinc- tive adaptation schemes matching eastern and western boundary current systems.
> For the Californian case, Rykaczewski and Checkley (2008) have suggested that the food-size preference com- bines with the relative strength of two distinct modes of upwelling (Fig. 11.39) to generate regimes favorable and unfavorable to sardines. Coastal upwelling forced by equa- torward nearshore winds generates cold, nutrient-rich eco- systems with diatoms supporting abundant larger zooplankton (Calants, Euphausia, • . .). If that is the only prevalent upwelling effect, then anchovy are more likely to thrive. In sardine-favorable intervals, winds are stronger well offshore than close inshore, such that there is strong wind-stress curl (a spatial gradient in wind speed). Then, in addition to coastal upwelling, slower, more dispersed upwelling occurs by different physics, by " E k m a npumping" offshore of the main upwelling (Fig. 11.39). That extends the zone of enhanced primary production seaward, but at a less-intense level. This supports greater production of smaller zooplankton (possibly Paracalanus and Oithona) without strong cooling, setting the scene for increases in sardines. Rykaczewski and Checkley show the effect by comparing levels of curl-driven upwelling (calculated from monthly mean wind-speed maps) for the May-July season of sardine larval development with sardine "surplus pro- duction", basically a measure from fisheries and survey data of sardine recruitment, a statistic primarily influenced each
> year by the abundance of 0-age sardines (Fig. 17.22). The resemblance is close enough that they may well be right. A

> The timing of Humboldt Current switches between
> anchovies and sardines has been attributed by Alheit and Bakun (2010) directly to the distinctions between the species in temperature preference and feeding ecology.The rise in sardines starting about 1972 corresponded with a strong and prolonged rise in near-coast SST and salinity. Conditions shifted from predominance of cold coastal water (14-18°C, S= 35) to more prevalent subtropical surface conditions (18-27°C, S= 35.1-35.7). Large z00- plankton became diminished, anchovy recruitment (already hammered by fishery removal of older spawners) fell, and stock abundance plummeted and stayed down. Sardines were favored by the new conditions, theirstock coming to support fisheries of 6 M t y r . In the late 1980s, conditions shifted back toward lower temperatures a n dsalinity. Coastal sardines declined and anchovy finally recovered and were again fished at a 12 Mtyr-' rate in 1993. They dropped from that peak, but stocks and yields have remained high, except for 1998. Fishingwas actually stopped for a signifi- cant interval during the El Niño of that year, and then resumed.
> Synchrony of the Humboldt and Japanese sardine "outbursts" of 1973-1993 appears to have to do with at least Pacific-scale atmospheric "teleconnections". but the
> Japanese case is quite different. The Japanese sardine migrates to spawn in winter w h e r ethe Kuroshio approaches Japan.The larvae are carried north as they grow, the adults migrating also into the Kuroshio-Oyashio confluence where both juvenilesand adults feed and grow. Recruitment is strongest during cooler periods in the spawning grounds, which tend to correspond to greaterzooplankton stocks in the spring feeding grounds. T h i scombination appears to be associated with the strength o fthe Asian winter monsoon, for which of course there is an index, the MOI (high from

We clearly must wait and observe!) through at least one more cycling from anchovy to sardines in all of these regions to more fully understand the control mechanisms. More long-term climatevariation, including anthropogenic warming, may cause such cycles to shift i nduration and in their relationships to atmospheric events.
> Regime shifts have major economic and cultural conse- quences for entire regions along the coast. There was a dramatic regime shift affecting salmon over the past three decades. About 1976 there was a fairly sudden warming across the entire northern reach of the Pacific, at least a 0.5°C increase in mean surface temperatures. This was beneficial to salmon at the northern end of their range, so that catches in the northern Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea climbed to unheard-of heights. Meanwhile, with warming and probably reduced lower-trophic-level pro- duction, the ocean survival of salmon plummeted off Washington and Oregon, USA. Most stocks became inad- equate to support commercial fishing. Not only was it hard to catch fish in the Pacific Northwest in the 1980s and early
> 1990s, but prices were depressed by abundant, and there-
> fore cheap, salmon from Alaska. Boats were sold, process- ing plants closed and port waterfronts were converted to
> tourist restaurants. In Alaska, in contrast, boats were pur- chased, processors expanded,college students got summer jobs cutting fish, and fishers and others made a good living. In about 1999 there was another shift, at least off the Oregon and Washington coasts. Ocean survival, particu- larly of coho salmon, rebounded, and in 2001 the number of salmon returning to the Columbia River hatcheries set a record (perhaps partly because ocean fishing had not yet rebounded in response). Returns have increased and decreased on ayear-to-year basis since. With some one-year exceptions, Alaska catches have remained high.
