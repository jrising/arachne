> I would like to make my drive to work more productive. I need google maps open, but I would also like to use voice commands to switch between (1) Audible, (2) Speechify or another text-to-speech program that reads PDFs I provide, and (3) a speech-to-text note-taker. I have an Android phone. How can I set up something like this?

> You can make your daily commute more productive by using a combination of voice-activated apps and Android's built-in functionality. Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can set this up:
> 
> **1. Use Google Assistant for Voice Commands:**
> 
> Your Android phone comes pre-built with Google Assistant, which can recognize and respond to voice commands. To ensure it's activated:
> 
>    - Go to the "Google" app, tap "More" at the bottom right.
>    - Tap "Settings", then choose "Google Assistant".
>    - Follow the prompts and turn on the assistant, if it is not activated yet.
>    
> **2. Voice Commands for Audible, Speechify, and a Notetaking App:**
> 
> You can ask Google Assistant to open and control these apps. Here is how you can do it:
> 
>    - For Audible: Say "Ok Google, play Audible". Note that you'll need to pause or stop manually as there's no voice command available for that yet.
> 
>    - For Speechify (or similar apps): While there is no specific command to switch to Speechify, you can open it by saying "Okay Google, open Speechify". To read a specific PDF, you can use the app's built-in text-to-speech feature.
> 
>    - For text-to-speech note takers: Consider apps like Evernote or Google Keep which support voice input. You can open them by saying "Hey Google, take a note" or "Hey Google, open Evernote/Google Keep".
> 
> **3. Setting Default Navigation to Google Maps:**
> 
> You probably want to keep Google Maps open while you're commuting. To set this up:
> 
>    - Go to your Android settings and find the default apps setting (usually under Apps & notifications or App management, depending on your Android version).
>    - Set Google Maps as your default navigation app.
>    
> **4. Use a Car Dashboard App:**
> 
> To make switching between apps easy and safe while driving, consider using a car dashboard app. Android Auto is a mobile app developed by Google that provides an interface that's easier (and safer) to use while driving. You can set up Android Auto to display Google Maps along with shortcuts to Audible, Speechify/PDF reader, and your notetaking app.
> 
> Remember to always prioritize safety while driving. Android Auto and Google Assistant both encourage voice commands to minimize distractions, but it's important to remain focused on the road at all times.
