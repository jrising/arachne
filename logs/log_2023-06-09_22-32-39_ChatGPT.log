> The following are the first paragraphs of a drafted paper introduction. I believe that I am missing one important point-- that it is to accurately measure the response of crop production to climate/weather. This is the goal of the paper, so I feel like it should go near the top, but one of the reasons it's important is because of the long investment horizons, which I only introduce in paragraph 3. How can I rearrange this discussion to include this point about the importance of accurately measuring crop responses to weather and climate?

> 
> Perennial crops account for 13% of global cropland, but produce 35% of the value of agricultural exports (Appendix \ref{sec:perecon}, \citealt{monfreda2008farming}). Low income economies are particularly reliant on perennial crops, which constitute an average 56% of the value of their agricultural exports and 10% of their total exports. Despite their economic significance, our understanding of perennials' response to environmental factors, especially climate and weather conditions, is notably insufficient.
> 
> A critical gap in current research is the accurate measurement of the response of perennial crop production to climate and weather. Early Nerlove models have substantially advanced our understanding of perennial crop supply response to prices \citep{nerlove1979dynamics}, but few statistical or biophysical models of perennial responses to weather exist. This deficiency significantly limits the development of effective agricultural strategies in a rapidly changing global climate.

> Perennial crops, owing to their unique characteristics, require a nuanced understanding of their responses to environmental shocks and adaptation actions. They are a form of semi-durable capital, necessitating long investment horizons and the competent management of environmental variability.\footnote{As \citet{brady2013changes} note, ``From a modeling perspective, perennial crop planting decisions may have more in common with housing and manufacturing than with annual row crop production.''} Furthermore, perennial crop production is deeply influenced by factors such as plantings, removals, and age-distributions-- elements central to perennials-- for which empirical data are typically unavailable. Many studies have to rely on recorded harvest areas as proxies when describing investment and yields \citep{elnagheeb1993modeling, askari1977estimating, lobell2006impacts}.

> Can you suggest an edit to the sentence "Despite their economic significance, our understanding of perennials' response to environmental factors, especially climate and weather conditions, is notably insufficient." that focuses on the fact that most existing work is on annual crops (rather than that it is insufficient in some absolute sense)?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, here is a revision that emphasizes the disparity of research focus between annual and perennial crops:
> 
> "Despite their economic significance, much of the existing agricultural research has been disproportionately focused on annual crops, leaving the understanding of perennials' response to environmental factors, notably climate and weather conditions, comparatively less explored."
> 
> This sentence emphasizes that while existing research may be substantial, it is unevenly distributed, resulting in a lesser understanding of perennial crops' response to environmental factors.
