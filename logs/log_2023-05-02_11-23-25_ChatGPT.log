> IMPLAN (Impact Analysis for Planning) is an economic impact assessment software system used to create input-output models that estimate the impact of changes in a local or regional economy. It calculates economic multipliers and quantifies the ripple effects of a given activity on the broader economy.
> 
> In IMPLAN, "Total Final Demand" refers to the total value of goods and services required to satisfy the needs of end-users, while "industry outputs" represent the total value of goods and services produced by each industry.
> 
> You may observe a "Total Final Demand" that is less than the sum of industry outputs because not all goods and services produced by industries are consumed within the region. Some of these goods and services might be exported to other regions or countries, or some industries may have excess production that is not consumed.
> 
> In other words, "Total Final Demand" only represents the portion of industry outputs that is consumed within the study region, while the sum of industry outputs represents the total production, regardless of whether the goods and services are consumed locally, exported, or not consumed at all.
> 
> It's important to remember that input-output models like IMPLAN are simplifications of complex economic systems and may not capture all nuances of an economy. Thus, it's crucial to interpret and use the results with care and a thorough understanding of the limitations of the models.
