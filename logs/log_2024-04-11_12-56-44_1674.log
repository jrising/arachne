> A student just claimed that 36.8 Gt of CO2 is equal to 40.5 billion tonnes. Why would the number be different? Am I missing something?

> When we talk about 'tonnes' and 'Gt' in the context of carbon dioxide emissions, we're likely discussing the same units in different scales.

> Thus, if the student claims 36.8 Gt of CO2 is equal to 40.5 billion tonnes, there's indeed a numerical discrepancy.

> The very likely reason for this numerical difference here is either a conversion error or a simple arithmetic mistake. The correct comparison should be:
> 
> 36.8 Gt CO2 = 36.8 billion tonnes CO2

> This would be equal to 40.5 billion tonnes, if and only if, some conversion factor or coefficient was being applied. But when direct equality between Gt and billion tonnes is in question, 36.8 Gt should be equal to 36.8 billion tonnes, not 40.5 billion tonnes.
