> Sure, I'm happy to help. However, since I only have basic knowledge about IMT (Institute for Market Transformation), I will need some information about their specific needs. For instance, are there any special areas or sectors in which the IMT is particularly interested (e.g., sustainability, energy efficiency)? Also, are there any specific types of expertise it would value in a board member (e.g., energy policy, real estate)?
