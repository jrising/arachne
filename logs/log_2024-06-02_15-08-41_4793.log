> In python, how can I create a list of functions, each of which takes its argument from an entry in a list? It seems like if I say:
**assistant**:
> This is a common issue related to closures within loops in Python. When creating functions inside a loop, the functions capture the variable itself, not its current value. By the time you actually call the function, the loop has completed, often resulting in all functions using the last value from the loop.
> 
> To fix this, you need to bind each function to its variable value at each iteration. One way to achieve this is by using a default argument in a lambda or a nested function.
> 
> Here's an example using lambdas with default arguments:
> 
> ```python
> values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> 
> # List to hold functions
> functions = []
> 
> # Loop through values to create functions
> for v in values:
>     functions.append(lambda x=v: x)
> 
> # Now each function should return its corresponding value
> for f in functions:
>     print(f())
> ```
> 
> Alternatively, you can use a nested function to bind the current value of the loop variable:
> 
> ```python
> values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> 
> # List to hold functions
> functions = []
> 
> # Function to bind current value of the loop variable
> def make_function(val):
>     def func():
>         return val
>     return func
> 
> # Loop through values to create functions
> for v in values:
>     functions.append(make_function(v))
> 
> # Now each function should return its corresponding value
> for f in functions:
>     print(f())
> ```
> 
> Both of these approaches ensure that each function in the list captures the value of the loop variable at each iteration, rather than the final value after the loop concludes.
