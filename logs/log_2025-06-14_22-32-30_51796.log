> I have heard of a country grouping that some group did-- maybe something inside the UN-- which is both geographic and by income or similar economies. Do you know what this was?
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you might be thinking of the World Bank's country classification system or potentially the United Nations' regional groups. The World Bank classifies countries based on geographic regions and income categories: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. These classifications are commonly used to group countries with similar economic characteristics.
> 
> Alternatively, the UN has a classification system that includes geographic regions and also groups countries based on economic and social factors. For instance, the UN's regional groups often include categories like "least developed countries" (LDCs) and "landlocked developing countries" (LLDCs), among others.

**user**:
> I think both of these are just two distinct categorizations. I'm looking for something that is an intersection: North America High Income (= USA + Canada), North America Middle Income (= Mexico + ...).
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you are referring to the **World Bank's classification of economies** in the context of both geographic regions and income levels. This approach often results in distinct groupings, such as:
> 
> - **North America High-Income**: United States, Canada
> - **North America Upper-Middle-Income**: Mexico
> - **Central America**: Countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, often classified by their income level as well.
> 
> While the World Bankâ€™s classification doesn't explicitly combine these two dimensions into a singular grouping, researchers and policy analysts often create their own intersectional categories based on World Bank and UN data to analyze economic patterns and regional development.
> 
> For example, you might find studies or reports that break down regions by income in a more detailed way, even if that specific classification isn't a formal system. If you're looking for a specific source or dataset, I can help locate that!
