> I got a reviewer comment on my paper that says:
> "To synthesize the different statistical models from the literature, the authors use a random forest (RF). I have to note that it was difficult to follow the concrete method setup chosen in this work.
> Based on reading the methods, I could not tell what exactly was used as input and output to the prediction task. The hint comes in one single sentence (l. 128) in the main paper where it is said: “A random forest (RF) model is used to assign weights to each model based on its quality attributes.” The description in the Methods (“We fit an RF to each country, year, and Monte Carlo draw, including either (1) only attributes describing the flexibility of temperature and precipitation (K=3), (2) only attributes describing controls and background trends (K=5), (3) only data coverage attributes (K=3), or (4) all three of these groups of attributes (K=11).” l. 316ff) was not fully comprehendible. Here, it would have helped to have a formula stating what exact variables (and providing an overview of these variables and their types) are used as inputs and outputs. I found the necessary details in the Supplementary Materials 1.5 (which was not referenced in the text). I strongly recommend the authors to facilitate this by extending the description in the method and providing the necessary formulas and an overview of the variables and their potential values."

> In this case, the outcomes of the models are the outputs of the RF, and the inputs are the quality values. How can I represent this as a formula?
**assistant**:
> To address the reviewer's comment and represent your random forest model setup more clearly, you can introduce a formula that formalizes the relationship between inputs and outputs. This will help depict how the random forest weights or synthesizes the outcomes based on the quality attributes.

> You can structure the formula like this:
> 
> Let:
> - \( \mathbf{X} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_K] \) be the vector of quality attributes used as inputs to the random forest. These could include temperature and precipitation flexibility, controls and background trends, and data coverage attributes, with \( K \) representing the total number of attributes.
> - \( Y \) be the outcome of interest from each model which you want to estimate or weight using the RF. 
> 
> The relationship using the random forest can be represented as:
> 
> \[ Y_{\text{pred}} = f_{\text{RF}}(\mathbf{X}) \]
> 
> Here:
> - \( Y_{\text{pred}} \) is the predicted outcome from the RF model.
> - \( f_{\text{RF}} \) denotes the function learned by the random forest to map the input vector \( \mathbf{X} \) to the synthetic output \( Y_{\text{pred}} \).
> 
> In the context of your setup, \( Y_{\text{pred}} \) could represent the composite or weighted model outcome derived from inputs \( \mathbf{X} \), which are the quality attributes.

> To enhance understanding, consider enumerating the specific attributes and their types in accompanying text or a table. For example:
> 
> - **Temperature Flexibility Attribute**: Continuous value indicating response sensitivity.
> - **Precipitation Flexibility Attribute**: Continuous value indicating response sensitivity.
> - **Control Variables**: Categorical or continuous measures indicative of economic conditions.

> Be sure to reference your Supplementary Materials 1.5 in the main text, including a brief guide on where detailed variable descriptions can be found. This approach should help reviewers easily follow your methodological setup and understand the precise role of each component in your random forest synthesis.
