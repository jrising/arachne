**user**:
> How can I find symlinks in a directory tree on linux?
**assistant**:
> You can use the `find` command in Linux to locate symbolic links inside a directory tree. Here's how:
> 
> ```bash
> find /path/to/search/ -type l -ls
> ```
> 
> In this command:
> 
> - `/path/to/search/` should be replaced with the path of the directory tree you want to search.
> - `-type l` specifies that you are looking for symbolic links.
> - `-ls` will list in detail the found links.
> 
> This command will search for all symbolic links in the directory and its subdirectories. If you only want to search within the top directory, you can limit the depth of the search as follows:
> 
> ```bash
> find /path/to/search/ -maxdepth 1 -type l -ls
> ```
> 
> This will only find links that are directly inside `/path/to/search/`. The `-maxdepth 1` option specifies that `find` should not descend into any directories beyond the top directory.
