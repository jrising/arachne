> How long do infants use a bassinet stroller?
**assistant**:
> Infants can typically use a bassinet stroller from birth up until they reach a weight limit or outgrow the bassinet. The specific length of time an infant can use a bassinet stroller will vary depending on the weight limit and size of the stroller, as well as the individual growth rate of the baby. 
> 
> Generally, most bassinet strollers have a weight limit of around 20-25 pounds or until the baby is around 6 months old. However, some models may have a higher or lower weight limit, so it's important to check the manufacturer's specifications for the specific stroller you are using.
> 
> Once a baby reaches the weight limit or outgrows the bassinet, it's time to transition to a more appropriate stroller or carrier that can support their growing size and weight.
