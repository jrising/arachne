> I am trying to set up a Passenger website, and it was working, but now when I go to the domain I just get a message "This site canâ€™t be reached
> DOMAIN refused to connect." Nothing is written to the error logs. What's going on?

**assistant**:
> There could be a number of reasons why you're encountering this issue. Here are a few possibilities:
> 
> 1. **Server is down:** The server where your Passenger application is hosted may be down. You can verify this by trying to SSH into your server. If you can't, your server is likely down or experiencing issues.
> 
> 2. **Firewall settings:** The server's firewall may be preventing connections. Make sure the firewall is configured to accept incoming connections on the necessary ports.
> 
> 3. **Network issues:** There could be network issues either at the server's end or your end. Check your own internet connection and try accessing other sites. 
> 
> 4. **Configuration issues:** There may be incorrect settings in the Passenger configuration file. Check your configuration settings and make sure they're correct. 
> 
> 5. **DNS issues:** If the DNS has recently been changed, it might take time for the changes to propagate. You can check if the DNS is resolving correctly by using a tool such as 'dig' on a Linux/Mac command line.

> Since you mentioned that nothing is written to the error logs, it's more likely that it's an issue related to network connectivity, firewall settings or server downtime. Try troubleshooting these potential issues one by one. If the issue persists, please provide me with further details, and I'd be happy to help you delve deeper into the problem.
