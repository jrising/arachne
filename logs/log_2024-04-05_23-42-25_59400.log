> In the Meno, Socrates gives a definition of figure that he likes, and then a definition of color that Meno likes. And he says that he thinks Meno will start to like his definition more if he stays and is initiated in the mysteries, rather than goes away "before the mysteries". Are these the Eleusinian mysteries? Why would they help him better to understand the kind of answers Socrates gives?

> In Plato's dialogues, the "Mysteries" that Socrates refers to can indeed be interpreted as the famed Eleusinian Mysteries of Ancient Greece—major religious events shrouded in secrecy. However, in the context of the dialogue, the mysteries Socrates refers to are more generally the mysteries of philosophical enquiry and knowledge. It is a metaphor rather than a literal reference to the Eleusinian mysteries. In essence, Socrates suggests that if Meno continues to engage deeply with philosophy, he will start to understand and appreciate Socrates' approach to defining terms.

> The Eleusinian Mysteries involved a transformative journey embarked upon by initiates, similar to philosophical enquiry. Both demanded time, commitment, a prepared mind, and were transformative in nature. However, they differed in their goals: the Mysteries aimed to instill spiritual understanding and to guarantee a beneficial afterlife, while Socratic philosophy pursued a clearer understanding of concepts and ideas through reasoned argument.
> 
> Socratic method, or elenchus, involves questioning assumptions, deconstructing false beliefs, and seeking evidence or logical consistency. Socrates offers Meno a taste of this process in their discussion about the nature of virtue. He implies that if Meno stays, engages deeply, and gets "initiated" in the mysteries of philosophy (much like one would get initiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries), he will come to understand wisdom in a Socratic sense—something beyond plain definitions. Thus, the comparison to mystery religions serves as an enticing metaphor, prompting Meno to further his philosophical journey. 
> 
> In summary, Socrates might not be suggesting that the Eleusinian Mysteries provide the same understanding as philosophical enquiry. Instead, he uses the idea of initiation into spiritual mysteries as a metaphorical parallel to initiation into the mysteries of philosophy.
