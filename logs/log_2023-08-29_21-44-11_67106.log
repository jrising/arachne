> In the marine waters of Delaware, various shipping activities play significant roles. Coastal Freight Transport, for instance, has seen a fluctuation in workforce over the years from 2011 to 2019. The average number of employees has been about 34, with a range from a minimum of 30 to a maximum of 38. The establishments that employed these workers varied between 1 and 5 during the same period. 
> 
> Unlike Coastal Freight, Deep Sea Freight Transport maintained a stable workforce of 98 employees consistently from 2011 to 2019. The number of establishments dedicated to deep-sea freight was fewer, varying from 1 to 4. 
> 
> As for the types of ships passing through, cargo ships comprise a considerable chunk of the maritime traffic at 22%. With a typical length of approximately 227 meters, it's estimated that there are about 7,571 cargo ships that have passed through. Tanker ships, though smaller in count and representing just 8% of the maritime traffic, are comparable in size with an average length of 222 meters. An estimated 3,474 tanker ships have navigated through the Delaware marine waters.
