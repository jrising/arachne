> In filling out a legal document where I am acting as a subcontractor, how should I fill in "Name & Title"?
**assistant**:
> In the "Name & Title" field, you should provide your legal name, as it appears on any official government documents, and the official capacity in which you are acting as a subcontractor for the project. The title usually reflects your role or job function. 
> 
> Here's an example:
> * Name: James Rising
> * Title: Independent Contractor, Interdisciplinary Modeler
> 
> However, the exact way to fill this in can depend on the specifics of your arrangement. If you are operating through a business entity, you might need to include that:
> 
> * Name: James Rising, ABC Modeling Services, Inc.
> * Title: President
> 
> Remember, this isn't legal advice, and if you are unsure about the specifics, it's always a good idea to consult with a legal professional or the entity who provided the document.
