> You can get corporate sponsors by following these steps:
> 
> **1. Identify Potential Sponsors:** Research companies that align with your program's mission and goals. Look for companies with a history of corporate social responsibility, sponsorship, or whose products/services relate to your program.
> 
> **2. Develop a Proposal:** Create a professional proposal that outlines your program, its objectives, the benefits that the sponsorship will provide the company, and the different sponsorship levels that are available. Also, discuss how their contribution will make a difference.
> 
> **3. Reach Out Personally:** Utilize your network. Try to establish personal contact with the individuals responsible for sponsorships in the companies you've identified. A cold call or letter is less personal and might get lost in the shuffle.
> 
> **4. Tailor Your Pitch:** Customize your sponsorship request to each company. Be sure it connects with their corporate goals, and their goals for community involvement.
> 
> **5. Provide Recognition:** Let potential sponsors know that in recognition of their sponsorship, they will receive publicity and have the opportunity to be associated with a positive cause. You can offer them exposure on your website, at your events, or within media outreach.
> 
> **6. Follow-Up:** If you haven't heard back after two weeks, don't hesitate to follow up. They might have missed your initial contact or they haven't had time to respond.
> 
> **7. Deliver on Promises:** Once you've secured sponsorship, ensure you deliver on each point of your agreement. Take this opportunity to cultivate the relationship for future sponsorships.
> 
> Remember, corporate sponsorship is not just about getting funding for your projects, it's about building relationships and providing value to your sponsors. Good luck in finding your sponsors!
