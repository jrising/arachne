> Cautionary Notes
> In light of recent research and policy experience, the most plausible long-run forecast is for rising, not falling, environmental quality in both high- and low- income economies. Indeed, it is likely that the environmental Kuznets curve has begun to flatten downward under the combined impact of economic liberalization, improved information, and more stringent and cost-effective approaches to regu- lating pollution under developing-country conditions. But although we are san- guine about the prospects for combining economic growth and environmental protection, we remain cautious optimists. At least four plausible concerns have been raised.
> Will Countries Need to Suffer Lower Environmental Quality in the Short and Medium Run?
> The conventional environmental Kuznets curve implies that vast areas of the world—including much of Asia and Africa—will have to experience rising pollution levels until their per capita incomes rise significantly. However, there is no evidence to support the view that this would be economically advantageous. Several benefit- cost analyses have made a persuasive case for stricter pollution control, even in very low income economies. In China, for example, a recent study has shown that the economic returns to pollution abatement would justify significant tightening of regulation (Dasgupta, Wang and Wheeler, 1997). Studies in Indonesia (Calkins, 1994) and Brazil (Von Amsberg, 1997) have produced similar conclusions.
> Countries whose economic policies induce a rapid expansion of income and employment may experience severe environmental damage unless appropriate environmental regulations are enacted and enforced. Economic analysis can be employed to justify environmental regulatory policies that result in a flatter and lower environmental Kuznets curve.

> Confronting the Environmental Kuznets Curve 159
> Globalization and the Risk of a Race to the Bottom
> Perhaps the most commonly heard critique of the environmental Kuznets curve is that even if such a relationship existed in the past, it is unlikely to exist in the future because of the pressures that global competition places on environmen- tal regulations. In the “race to the bottom” scenario, relatively high environmental standards in high-income economies impose high costs on polluters. Shareholders then drive firms to relocate to low-income countries, whose people are so eager for jobs and income that their environmental regulations are weak or nonexistent. Rising capital outflows force governments in high-income countries to begin relax- ing environmental standards. As the ensuing race to the bottom accelerates, the environmental Kuznets curve flattens and rises toward the highest existing level of pollution.
> In the United States, political opponents of the World Trade Organization (WTO) frequently invoke elements of this model. For example, Congressman David Bonior (1999) offered the following critique: “The WTO, as currently structured, threatens to undo internationally everything we have achieved nation- ally—every environmental protection, every consumer safeguard, every labor vic- tory.” Herman Daly (2000), an economist at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Affairs, has recently provided a forceful statement of the race to the bottom model.
> Proponents of this model often recommend high environmental standards that would be uniform around the world. For countries that are unwilling or unable to enforce such standards, tariffs or other restrictions and penalties would be imposed on exports of their pollution-intensive products to neutralize their cost advantage as “pollution havens.” Proponents of free trade naturally view these prescriptions as anathema, arguing that their main impact would be denial of jobs and income to the world’s poorest people.
> The race to the bottom model has an air of plausibility. It does appear that polluting activities in high-income economies face higher regulatory costs than their counterparts in developing countries (Jaffe, Peterson, Portney and Stavins, 1995; Mani and Wheeler, 1998). This creates an incentive for at least some highly polluting industries to relocate. But how substantial is this incentive compared to the other location incentives faced by businesses? To what extent have countries actually been reducing their environmental standards to provide such location incentives?
> Research in both high- and low-income countries suggests that pollution control does not impose high costs on business firms. Jaffe, Peterson, Portney and Stavins (1995) and others have shown that compliance costs for OECD industries are surprisingly small, despite the use of command-and-control regulations that are economically inefficient. Firms in developing countries frequently have even lower abatement costs, because the labor and materials used for pollution control are less costly than in the OECD economies.

> relocation (Eskeland and Harrison, 1997; Albrecht, 1998; Levinson, 1997; Van Beers and van den Bergh, 1997; Tobey, 1990, Janicke, Binder and Monch, 1997). More important factors include distance to market and infrastructure quality and cost (Mody and Wheeler, 1992). In a study of Mexican maquiladora plants, Gross- man and Krueger (1993) found that pollution abatement costs were not a major determinant of imports from Mexico, while their unskilled labor component was of paramount importance. Most OECD-based multinationals maintain nearly uniform environmental standards in their national and international plants. They do so to realize economies in engineering standards for design, equipment purchases and maintenance; to reduce potential liability from regulatory action; and to guard against reputational damage in local and international markets (Dowell, Hart and Yeung, 2000).
> In fairness, the evidence also suggests that pollution havens can emerge in extreme cases (Xing and Kolstad, 1995). During the 1970s, for example, environ- mental regulation tightened dramatically in the OECD economies with no coun- tervailing change in developing countries. The regulatory cost differential was apparently sufficient to generate a significant surge in production and exports of pollution-intensive products from developing countries. Since then, however, reg- ulatory changes in the developing countries have narrowed the gap and apparently stopped the net migration of polluting industries (Mani and Wheeler, 1998). This pattern of tighter environmental regulations in low-income countries runs counter to the “race to the bottom” scenario.
> Indeed, the scenario in which more heavily polluting industries locate in low-income countries and export back to high-income countries appears to be an incorrect description of actual patterns. In recent times, developing country im- ports from high-income economies have been more pollution-intensive than their exports to those economies (Mani and Wheeler, 1998; Albrecht, 1998).
> In short, there are many reasons to be dubious about the race to the bottom model. But perhaps the most powerful challenge to the model is a direct assessment of its simple and robust prediction: After decades of increasing capital mobility and economic liberalization, the race to the bottom should already be underway and pollution should be increasing everywhere. It should be rising in poor countries because they are pollution havens, and in high-income economies because they are relaxing standards to remain cost- competitive. Wheeler (2001) has tested these propositions using data on foreign investment and urban air quality in China, Mexico and Brazil. Together, these three countries received 60 percent of the total foreign direct investment for developing countries in 1998. If the race to the bottom model is correct, then air pollution should be rising in all three countries. Moreover, air quality should be deteriorating in U.S. cities, since U.S. industrial imports from all three countries have been expanding for decades.
> As Figures 4 and 5 indicate, the converse is true: Instead of racing toward the bottom, major urban areas in China, Brazil, Mexico and the United States have all experienced significant improvements in air quality, as measured by concentrations

> Are Other Pollutants Rising? The Case of Toxic Chemicals
> Even if one accepts the evidence that growth in per capita income can be accompanied by reductions in well-known conventional pollutants, there is still a question about whether other less-known pollutants and environmental hazards may be rising with levels of per capita income.
> One recent focus has been on emissions of toxic organic chemicals into the air and water. Although some toxic chemicals are monitored in some industrialized countries, they remain largely unregulated almost everywhere. Thornton (2000) argues that conventional regulation has failed to control the proliferation of organic chlorine compounds that are carcinogenic and mutagenic. He recom- mends banning the whole family of chlorine compounds, which would be econom- ically disruptive, to put it mildly. The international community has begun respond- ing to such thinking for some “persistent” organic pollutants that are among the organochlorines known to be most dangerous, because they accumulate in plant and animal life. In May 2001, 127 countries signed a treaty to ban international production and trade in twelve persistent organic pollutants, including PCBs, dioxins, DDT and other pesticides that have been shown to contribute to birth defects and cancer (“U.N. Treaty on Chemicals,” 2001).

> recent treaty banning production and sale of persistent organic pollutants may be a harbinger of broader regulatory changes that will affect both developed and developing countries.
> This issue provides a useful reminder that our understanding of environmen- tal problems and remedies must develop over time. It seems unlikely that address- ing pollution from organochlorines and other toxics will require measures as radical as those suggested by Thornton (2000). However, it will clearly be inappro- priate to declare conventional environmental protection a success if it reduces a limited list of conventional pollutants while ignoring an ever-growing list of toxic pollutants that may pose threats to future generations as well as this one.
> Building Regulatory Capability
> If per capita income and environmental quality are to increase together, developing countries will require effective regulatory capabilities. These capabili- ties include not only appropriate legal measures for regulation, but also effective monitoring and enforcement of regulatory compliance. Better environmental gov- ernance, broadly understood, involves the enactment of liberalizing economic measures that affect pollution through their impact on an economy’s sectoral composition and efficiency. It also includes the capability to develop and dissemi- nate information about environmental quality and pollution sources, even if such information may embarrass certain government officials in the short run. Much of the pessimism about the prospects for environmental quality in developing coun- tries is not about whether a win-win outcome is technically possible for the economy and the environment, but whether these societies have the institutional capabilities necessary for achieving such an outcome.
> The evidence on how regulatory capability can be developed is sparse, but the World Bank’s indicators of institutional and policy development provide grounds for moderate optimism. It appears that productive public policy is correlated with economic development—but that there is considerable variation in the relation- ship. Some excellent economic performers have quite poor regulatory capability by international standards. In turn, general policy indicators predict environmental policy performance very well, but some countries with low overall policy ratings have proven capable of focused efforts to protect critical environmental assets. The most pronounced outliers are mostly countries where specific natural resources are important determinants of tourist revenue, such as Maldives, Seychelles, Belize, Ecuador and Bhutan. Apparently, even poorly administered societies can strengthen regulation when environmental damage is clear, costly, and concen- trated in a few sites. But these exceptions aside, it seems unlikely that broader environmental regulation will outpace more general institutional reform. A full response to the environmental challenge of globalization will therefore require serious attention to long-run development of public sector administrative and decision-making capacity.

> optimal measures under the conditions that prevail in developing countries. For example, Colombia’s successful pollution charge program became politically fea- sible only after regulators, industrialists, and public sewerage authorities agreed to use part of the revenues to support local regulatory agencies and to invest the rest in local environmental projects. Although traditional public finance theory does not support earmarking revenues in this way, rather than balancing costs and benefits of all spending choices, the program’s results have clearly compensated for this conceptual flaw. Local financing may also prove to be critical during future recessions, when Colombia’s central government may reduce support for national monitoring and enforcement of regulations. However, accepting political reality does not imply uncritical acceptance of any funding scheme. The designers of Colombia’s system have stressed the application of clear benefit-cost criteria to local financing of pollution reduction projects.

**assistant**:
> In this section of the paper "Confronting the Environmental Kuznets Curve" by Dasgupta et al. (2002), the authors discuss some cautionary notes regarding the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality.
> 
> The authors argue that recent research and policy experience suggest that environmental quality is likely to rise, rather than fall, in both high- and low-income economies in the long run. They attribute this to factors such as economic liberalization, improved information, and more effective approaches to regulating pollution in developing countries. Despite being optimistic about combining economic growth and environmental protection, they raise several concerns:
> 
> 1. The view that countries must tolerate lower environmental quality until their per capita incomes rise significantly is not supported by evidence. Benefit-cost analyses have shown that stricter pollution control is economically justifiable even in low-income economies.
> 
> 2. Globalization and the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis, which suggests that high-income countries relax environmental standards to compete with low-income countries, face criticism. Research indicates that pollution control does not impose high costs on businesses, and pollution havens have not emerged as predicted by the race-to-the-bottom model.
> 
> 3. The authors discuss the potential rise of other pollutants and environmental hazards, such as toxic chemicals, as a consequence of economic development. They highlight the need for broad regulatory changes and international cooperation to address these risks.
> 
> 4. Developing countries require effective regulatory capabilities to achieve both economic growth and environmental quality. This includes appropriate legal measures, monitoring, and enforcement. The authors acknowledge the variation in the relationship between economic development and regulatory capability and emphasize the importance of long-term development of institutional capacity.

> Moreover, sustaining effective environmental regulation requires the design of appropriate financing mechanisms that may depart from traditional public finance theories. Local financing, including the use of pollution charges, can support regulatory agencies and environmental projects.

> Overall, the authors caution that while economic growth can potentially coexist with environmental protection, addressing environmental challenges requires attention to long-term development, institutional capacity building, and effective regulation.
