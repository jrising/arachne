> Dear Fattah,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out to UD regarding your application to the Environmental Economics program. I understand your disappointment and appreciate your enthusiasm for the field and the work being done at our institution.
> 
> Unfortunately, due to limited funding, we were only able to accept a very small number of students this year. While we read your application with interest, particularly your passion for integrating insights from neural networks and international trade in fishery studies, your GPA did not meet our admissions requirements for self-funded students either.
> 
> I encourage you to continue pursuing your interests in environmental economics and consider steps that might strengthen a future application, such as improving your academic record through additional coursework.
> 
> Thank you again for your interest and best of luck with all your future endeavors.

> Sincerely,

> Good evening Dr. Rising,

> I understand. I got the ideas for research based on yours and other faculty works. It's something I hope to build upon wherever I go for graduate school; speaking of which, I was admitted to the M.A. in economics at University of Hawaii - Manoa because of my interests. I think it's probably a good program especially since it offers a pathway to PhD like University of Delaware, but it's a big decision as I'd be leaving behind my friends and family, not to mention the insane cost of living. That's another reason why I was hoping to get into environmental economics at University of Delaware as that wouldn't be such a drastic move, yet I would have a premier education.
> 
> Anyway, I appreciate your response. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to change the decision; otherwise, I hope to stay connected and perhaps join your program at a later time so that I can hone myself as a researcher and academic.
