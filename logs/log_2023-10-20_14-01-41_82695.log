**user**:
> What was the population south of Egypt which eventually formed a super-religious kingdom around the New Kingdom period?
**assistant**:
> The population you're referring to is the Nubians, who lived in what is now southern Egypt and northern Sudan. They formed a powerful kingdom, known as the Kingdom of Kush, during the New Kingdom period in Egypt. Although initially under Egyptian control, the Kingdom of Kush regained its independence around 1070 BCE, when the New Kingdom began to decline.
> 
> The Nubians were known for their deep spirituality. Their religion was heavily influenced by ancient Egyptian religion, and they even built pyramids and temples similar to those in Egypt. They worshiped many of the same gods as the Egyptians and also had a god of their own, Apedemak, a lion-headed warrior god. The Kingdom of Kush lasted for several centuries, until it was conquered by the Aksumite Empire in 350 CE.
**user**:
> Didn't they also rule Egypt for a while?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you are correct. The Nubians of the Kingdom of Kush not only had a significant influence on Egypt but also ruled over Egypt during a period known as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (ca. 760-656 BCE). This period is sometimes referred to as the Nubian Dynasty or the Kushite Dynasty.
> 
> The rulers of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty were Nubian pharaohs, and their rule marked a period of cultural and political exchange between Nubia and Egypt. The Nubian pharaohs initially gained control over parts of Egypt, and eventually, their influence extended over the entire country. They established their capital at Napata, in the Kingdom of Kush, and later moved their capital to Memphis, a prominent city in Egypt.
> 
> The Nubian pharaohs, such as Taharqa and Piye, sought to revive and restore traditional Egyptian culture and religious practices during their rule. They commissioned temple construction projects, restored temples that had fallen into disrepair, and undertook military campaigns to protect Egypt from external threats.
> 
> However, their rule over Egypt eventually came to an end when they were overthrown by the Assyrians in 656 BCE. Nevertheless, the Nubian Dynasty's influence and contributions to Egyptian history left a lasting impact on Egyptian culture and artistic traditions.
