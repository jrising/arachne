> # Summary and Organization of Velux Meeting Notes (12.17.24)
> 
> ## Key Takeaways
> - No new projects could be established with Velux during the discussion due to constraints in Velux's ability to accomplish tasks.
> - Spanning halfway, James's meeting with Velux has led to discussions about the UK and decarbonizing energy, though there is no work with a specific organization in the US and the UK yet. 
> - They are facing the challenge of resource scarcity in the U.S market, forcing them to scale back and adopt a more targeted approach.
> - The "Healthy Buildings and Living Places" initiative was pushed to 2026/27.
> 
> ## ACTION Points
> - James to connect with USGBC (California)
> - Discuss with Oliver who recommended them.
> - Collaboration with Velux has taken a shift towards "thought leadership," indicating a reworking of strategies and approaches.
> 
> ## Velux's Current Status and Future Planning
> - The Velux Group is planning to hire a new role for regulatory affairs, while progressing work in healthy buildings as per their Healthy Buildings Barometer 2024.
> - Velux has entered a new partnership with Thylander, focusing on the Living Places Concept.
> - They are facing constraints in what they can accomplish, especially in the U.S., making it necessary to contemplate future strategies for 2025.
> - Their focus is now more on strategic advocacy, engaged locally, that significantly influences the skylight industry.
> 
> ### Travel Plans
> - Julia is traveling to Copenhagen, Denmark with her South African partner. Their daughter will be with her other mother.
> - Sophia Rini, based in Europe, has a two-week vacation planned.
> 
> ### Christmas
> - Proposed to do something in Denmark, keeping in consideration the color preferences of Julia's daughter.
> 
> ## Follow-up and Next Steps
> - Velux plans to draft and pass the statewide building standard works in California.
> - They aim to advance regulations, with 50 regions lining up to pass a demand-side policy.
> - Replicate high-performance building hubs in other regions.
> - The focus is on expanding plans in California and taking on more unique standards.
> - Velux is looking for a person to do lobbying, precise standards are needed for the same.
> - Velux also plans to make a notable participation in Greenbuild 2025.
>     - [Greenbuild 2025](https://informaconnect.com/greenbuild/)
> - Upcoming events for Velux: NYC Climate Week, AIC Boston, Greenbuild, London Climate Action Summit.
> - They're developing a new proposal of options to present.
> - Top three US events to consider: NYCW, GreenBuild, AIA Boston.
> - UK and Poland proposed as new markets for 2026.
> - Velux is planning to hire a California person around codes (Ryland and Amy) for the best policy pathway.
> 
> ## Research Agenda
> - Comparative studies of programs in different regimes to see varying approaches, with a funder having interest.
> 
> ## Challenges
> - The organization in the U.S. is not mature yet for the work they plan to do.
> - The current capacity won't allow for quick turnaround, hence they can't present as a large-scale consulting firm doing research right now.
> 
> ### Notes
> - Alex mentioned that scaling back happens all the time and suggested focusing on policy briefs in key markets.
> - Niche participation strategies preferred.
