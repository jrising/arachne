> The potential environmental impacts of the construction, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind projects are important to consider in the siting of offshore wind turbines. Potential impacts include avian mortality and displacement, habitat displacement, acoustic impacts on marine mammals and sea turtles, disruption of migratory routes, and sensitive fish habitat disturbance, including impacts on endangered, threatened, and rare species. Data on the distribution and abundance of endangered, threatened, and protected species were compiled to evaluate the use of the marine environment by wildlife that may be affected by offshore wind development. Information on abundance, migration and residency, and extent of habitat can be analyzed for geographical overlap and the degree to which biologically significant impacts and dislocation of competing users may occur. From a scientific standpoint, biologically significant impacts can be considered to individuals or to populations. Impacts to individuals occur when the animal’s ability to grow, survive, and reproduce is compromised, while population-level effects can affect the viability of the species (National Research Council, 2005). Here, it is logical to consider biologically significant impacts at the population level, as many activities in the ocean can impact individuals and not every biologically significant impact to an individual will necessarily trigger the preparation of an EIS (as opposed to an EA) under NEPA. Further, while wildlife protection laws regulate impacts to individuals, they focus management attention at the population level. For example, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) ensures that stocks, or interbreeding groups of the same species, remain above the optimal sustainable population (16 USC 1361 et seq.) The Endangered Species Act (ESA) likewise manages for species, subspecies or distinct population segments (16 USC
> 1532). Lastly, benefits from CO2 reductions resulting from decreased use of fossil fuels are generally thought of on a large scale, in which benefits to wildlife would be assessed on a population level rather than individual level. From a management perspective, it is important that we consider impacts to groups larger than the individual as we look towards long-term viability of each species.

> Cold-Water Corals
> Cold-water corals, also referred to as deep-water corals, are prevalent in some parts of the northwest Atlantic Ocean, primarily in canyons and along the continental slope. Generally found below 40 meters, these corals are very long lived, creating important complex habitat for fisheries and other species (Williams, 2009). Although their ecological role is not fully understood, they are considered to form important ecological habitat. Further, due to their sensitivity, cold-water corals act as indicator species for marine threats such as climate change (Stiles et al., 2007). Threats such as commercial fishing, oil and gas drilling, offshore cables, and anchoring activities are also current threats facing cold-water corals (Williams, 2009). Currently, federally funded research that would potentially lead to additional conservation efforts is taking place under the umbrella of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation Act, among other research programs (NOAA, 2010). Wilmington Canyon and Baltimore Canyon are two major canyons within the study area where cold- water corals are found Wilmington Canyon and Baltimore Canyon (Stiles et al., 2007; Williams, 2009). These areas may be considered important habitat areas supporting an abundance of life beyond cold-water corals. The canyons where known cold water corals exist within the study were drawn as polygons in ArcGIS using canyons as a background reference area. Both of these canyons are over 100 meters deep and are therefore unlikely to conflict with near-term offshore wind development. In the future, deployment of floating turbines, which are anchored to the seafloor, can potentially result in conflicts in these areas and will need to be considered further.

> Essential Fish Habitat
> Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA), NOAA has jurisdiction to designate and manage essential fish habitat (EFH). EFH includes "waters and substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity” (50 CFR Part 600). EFH exists in the study area for one or more life stages of several federally managed species. The distribution of fish with designated EFH varies widely both spatially and seasonally. Many of the species are migratory, and are only present in the location for a period of time. Furthermore, species occur in different habitats during different life stages. EFH exists in the study area for the following species during one or more life stages: Atlantic cod, haddock, red hake, witch flounder, winter flounder, yellowtail flounder, windowpane founder, Atlantic sea scallop, ocean pout, Atlantic sea herring, monkfish, bluefish, tilefish, Atlantic butterfish, summer flounder, black sea bass, king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cobia, sand tiger shark, Atlantic angel shark, Atlantic sharpnose shark, dusky shark, sandbar shark, scalloped hammerhead shark, and tiger shark. The sandbar shark also has habitat of particular concern (HAPC) in this region (NOAA Fisheries, 2011). For listings of each life stage of EFH by 10-minute square, the reader is directed to the NOAA Fisheries Habitat Conservation Division Guide to EFH Designations (http://www.nero.noaa.gov/hcd/).
> Within states waters in the mid-Atlantic, the respective state fisheries management program is responsible for the management of fisheries with coordination by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) manages species from 3-200 nm from shore. The ASMFC coordinates conservation and interstate fisheries management of the American eel, American lobster, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic herring, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic sturgeon, black sea bass, bluefish, horseshoe crab, northern shrimp, red drum, scup, shad and river herring, Spanish mackerel, spiny dogfish and coastal sharks, spot, spotted seatrout, striped bass, summer flounder, tuatog, weakfish, and winter flounder (ASMFC, 2011). The MAFMC manages Atlantic mackerel, squid, butterfish, bluefish, spiny dogfish, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, surfclam, ocean quahog, tilefish, and monkfish (MAFMC, 2011). Proposed federal actions that may adversely affect areas that contain EFH must consult with NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for conservation recommendations (NOAA Fisheries, 2011). Fish living within the study area, including those with EFH or HAPC, may be affected by offshore wind development through changes to habitat, entrainment, auditory impacts, and indirect effects, some of which may be positive effects (Danish Institute for Fisheries Research, 2000; Dong Energy, 2006; Leonhard & Pederson, 2006; Wilson et al., 2010). Offshore canyons - Lydia, Oceanographer, Veatch and Norfolk - all have fishing restrictions due to EFH for tilefish, Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish. Within the study area, a shapefile for tilefish EFH was downloaded from NOAA Fisheries (2011). This area is supplemented by the addition of canyons off the continental shelf. In addition to being habitat for cold-water corals, these canyons host significant biodiversity, some of which are limited from certain fishing practices. Vector data for submarine canyons was downloaded as a polygon shapefile from the MARCO Portal.

> Selected important benthic habitat features are displayed to demonstrate areas where infrastructure development in the offshore environment may be conflicting. Please refer to Map 26. As indicated, features associated with the continental shelf break are rich habitat areas. Important habitat features also exist in the near-shore environment. Essential fish habitat (EFH), for example, exists throughout the study area for a number of species in one or more life stages. EFH for tilefish is displayed, which follows the shelf break. Other digital information of EFH has not been made available, and thus the reader is referred to the MARCO Portal (http://www.midatlanticocean.org/map_portal.html) for a display of marine habitats within the study area. Importantly, cold-water corals are known to be associated with Baltimore and Wilmington Canyons and thus they are biological hot spots, while other canyons in the area host high biodiversity as well. These areas are beyond near-term wind development, but should be considered as technology pushes turbine development into deeper waters. Artificial reefs have been added to this map as well to indicate areas of high density.
