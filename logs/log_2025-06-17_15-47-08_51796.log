> What kinds of Amphipoda are found in the Alps?
**assistant**:
> The Alps, being a mountainous region, host various kinds of Amphipoda, particularly those adapted to cold environments and freshwater ecosystems. Amphipods are small crustaceans often found in moist habitats like streams, lakes, and underground waters. In the Alps, you might encounter:
> 
> 1. **Niphargus species**: These are common in the subterranean waters of Europe, including the Alpine region. They are often found in karst systems and are usually blind, adapted to life in caves.
> 
> 2. **Gammarus species**: These are more commonly found in surface waters like streams and lakes. They play a crucial role in the aquatic ecosystem as detritivores.
> 
> 3. **Crangonyctidae**: This family includes species that often inhabit groundwaters and caves, being well adapted to the cold temperatures of alpine environments.
> 
> 4. **Pseudoniphargus species**: Though less common, these can also be found in some specific alpine aquatic environments, particularly in isolated underground waters.
> 
> If you're conducting a study or exploration, local biodiversity records or entomological surveys could give you a precise list of the native Amphipoda species in a specific Alpine area.
