> > Keep in mind that there are caveats. Browsers may (and often do) restrict what can be done in an `unload` or `beforeunload` event to prevent misuse. Also, not all close scenarios -- such as the browser crashing, losing network connectivity or being force closed via the system task manager - may not trigger these events. As such, server-side session timeouts are usually more reliable for knowing when to clean up after a user. However, for simple notifications like this, the method described should suffice.

**assistant**:
> James sought to understand how to receive a notification when a window is closed in a Flask application. I explained that Flask, since it uses HTTP which is stateless, cannot natively detect a window close event. However, I proposed a solution using JavaScript and AJAX on the client side. We can capture the `beforeunload` event with JavaScript which fires when the window is about to close and then send an AJAX request to a defined route in the Flask application. However, I cautioned James that this approach is susceptible to browser restrictions and exceptions like a browser crash or network outage. It also doesn't replace the reliability of server-side session timeouts for cleaning up after user activities. Furthermore, I stressed the importance of adhering to user data protection and privacy principles.
