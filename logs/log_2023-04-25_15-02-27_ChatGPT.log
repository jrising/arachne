> I would suggest you read "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus. Although not specifically focused on academic research, this book provides a thought-provoking existentialist perspective on the human condition, freedom, and the search for meaning. Through the story of Sisyphus, a figure from Greek mythology condemned to endlessly push a boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down again, Camus explores the concept of the absurd and the challenge of finding purpose in seemingly futile tasks.
> 
> In the context of academic research, the book can be interpreted as a discussion of the freedom and challenges that come with dedicating one's life to the pursuit of knowledge. The idea of Sisyphus can be applied to researchers who continually seek answers to complex questions, only to face new questions and challenges in the process.

> Additionally, you may find "The Denial of Death" by Ernest Becker interesting. This Pulitzer Prize-winning book discusses the human struggle to understand and come to terms with mortality. Becker examines how individuals invest time and effort in various pursuits, including academic research, as a way to create meaning and a sense of importance in the face of the inevitable reality of death.
> 
> Both of these works provide valuable existential insights that can help you reflect on the challenges and meaning of freedom in academic research.
