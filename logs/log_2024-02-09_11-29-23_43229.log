**user**:
> I am developing a model of marine larvae floating, and for many species of fish I have the amount of time that their eggs or larvae spend floating in the water (this from fishbase). But I've tried to collect the same information from sealifebase about non-fish species, and I can't find any species with this information. Is there a reason for that? How long should I expect them to float?
**assistant**:
> Sealifebase, like Fishbase, is an extremely valuable database for marine species data. However, it lacks comprehensive information on the pelagic duration of marine invertebrate larvae, reflecting a larger gap in the field of marine biology. The reason for this is twofold:
> 
> 1. Difficulties in monitoring and research: Non-fish marine species, such as crustaceans, mollusks, and echinoderms, often have small, numerous and widely dispersed larvae. Tracking these microscopic organisms in the vast ocean is challenging. 
> 
> 2. Vast variety: The larval stages of many marine invertebrates are highly diverse. Some release eggs that hatch into planktotrophic larvae (which feed on plankton and can last in this stage for months), while others develop into lecithotrophic larvae (which live off their yolk and have much shorter pelagic durations). Some species bypass a larval stage altogether, limiting the generalizability of available data.
> 
> The pelagic larval duration (PLD), the period during which larvae are free-floating and transported by ocean currents, varies tremendously among species, and can range from a few days to several months, though a few weeks is a common average for many species. Much of this time is spent growing and metamorphosing into a juvenile form before settling back to the seafloor.
> 
> Therefore, given the lack of specific data and the variety in developmental strategies, a reasonable approach for your model might be to consider a range of possible PLD values for each species based on its taxonomic group or ecological function, while taking into account factors like spawning season and temperature that may influence development time. Always refer to available literature or experts for guidance, if possible.
