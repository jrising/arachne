**user**:
> I want to construct a distinction between rich and poor countries based on GDP per capita. What is a standard dividing line?
> 
**assistant**:
> A common approach to distinguishing between different income levels of countries is the classification scheme used by the World Bank. However, the boundaries for these classifications are not fixed and often updated annually based on changes in the world economy.
> 
> As of 2023, the World Bank income classifications are as follows:
> 
> - Low-income economies are those with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $1,045 or less.
> - Lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,046 and $4,095.
> - Upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $4,096 and $12,695.
> - High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,696 or more.
> 
> Keep in mind that GDP per capita and GNI per capita are slightly different but often correspond closely. GDP measures only the income generated within a country, while GNI includes income from nationals living abroad and excludes income of foreigners living in the country.
> 
> Note that while income is a common way to differentiate between rich and poor countries, it is not the only factor that determines a country's level of development. Other factors such as the Human Development Index (HDI) which includes elements like education and health, or the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) may also be pertinent depending on your exact research interest.
