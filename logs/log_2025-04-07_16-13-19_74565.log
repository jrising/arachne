> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my keen interest in joining your research group as a PhD student to study the impacts of climate change through integrated assessment models, particularly focusing on food systems, fisheries, and resource management. Your work on modeling complex social-environmental systems aligns closely with my research interests and academic background.
> 
> I hold both an MS and B.Sc. in Oceanography from the University of Chittagong, Bangladesh. My MS thesis focused on the pharmacological potential of marine resources, specifically seaweeds and sea cucumbers from St. Martin’s Island, utilizing in vivo and in vitro methods. I also have research experience in microbial pollution and estuarine health. These experiences have deepened my interest in understanding the larger-scale environmental and socio-economic impacts of ocean change. My extensive field experience, combined with my skills in GIS, R, and microbial and chemical analysis, would allow me to effectively engage with your work.
> 
> Your research integrating empirical data and systems modeling to address climate-driven challenges in food and fisheries is especially compelling to me. I am eager to explore how such interdisciplinary approaches can inform sustainable resource management under future climate scenarios.
> 
> I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your projects and strengthen my skills in modeling, data analysis, and climate policy research.
> 
> Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response.

> Dear Jahin,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in joining my research group for your PhD studies. I appreciate the detailed overview of your background and your research interests, particularly your focus on the impacts of climate change on food systems and fisheries.
> 
> Your experience in oceanography and your skills in GIS, R, and microbial and chemical analysis are indeed relevant to the work my group undertakes. However, I must inform you that, unfortunately, we do not have any available funding for new PhD students this year.
> 
> If you are still interested in exploring potential opportunities within my group, I would be happy to have a preliminary discussion. Please feel free to schedule a time for a Zoom meeting via my scheduling link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).
> 
> Thank you once again for your interest, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
