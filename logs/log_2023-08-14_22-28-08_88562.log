> Summary
> The chapter revolves around the concept of Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) that emerges from the intrinsic and complex nature of human-nature interactions. It begins with a note on how human-nature interactions have rapidly evolved and intensified since the Industrial Revolution, contributing to the Anthropocene epoch—a period marked by significant human impacts on the planet’s ecosystems.
> 
> The authors discuss how historically, humans have attempted to dominate, conquer, and exploit nature, manifest in the prevalent model of “pollute first, clean up later.” Recognizing the growing vulnerabilities and detrimental impacts of such an approach, they argue for a paradigm shift towards sustainable development, which aims to meet current needs without compromising future generations.
> 
> However, the practice of sustainable development often lags behind its conceptual acceptance, mainly due to the lack of sufficient understanding of complex relationships between humans and nature. To address this gap and enable sustainable development, the authors introduce the integrated concept of CHANS.
> 
> CHANS emphasize the reciprocal interactions and feedbacks between human and natural components within multiple organizational levels. It underlines the assumption that changes in natural subsystems significantly influence human subsystems and vice versa. Building on this, the authors propose an overall conceptual framework for effective research on CHANS. This framework accentuates the critical understanding of human-nature relationships to better appreciate the constraints and consequences of human activities and develop improved socioeconomic development practices.
> 
> The chapter also applies the presented framework to a specific case of coupled human and wildlife systems in rural forest settings, demonstrating its comprehensiveness and adaptability. The authors conclude by highlighting the need for a unified language to articulate the complexities inherent in human-nature interactions more accurately and effectively.
> 
> Overall, the concept and framework of CHANS offer a basis for addressing the most pressing global sustainability challenges and navigating the Anthropocene epoch effectively.
> 
> 2.5 Theoretical foundations
> Our understanding of coupled systems (systems formed by the interaction of numerous parts or subsystems) can be expanded by using theories from various fields. The general systems theory provides a foundation, and other theories such as complex adaptive systems, Resilience theory, and Hierarchy theory address specific system attributes. Moreover, insights from disciplines like ecology, economics, and sociology can be beneficial for coupled systems research. Nevertheless, existing theories may need to be further developed to more effectively address coupled systems as they were originally developed in the context of natural or human subsystems.
> 
> Examples of adaptation and evolution to human changes, in contexts such as ecological niches and household activities, can be studied within a coupled systems framework. With more applications and testing of existing theories in coupled systems research, it is possible to revise these theories and even develop new ones.
> 
> 2.6 Methods for studying coupled systems
> Studying coupled systems necessitates a multi-method approach and expertise from a variety of natural and social science disciplines. The research process encompasses the human subsystem, the natural subsystem, and their interactions, and it can be divided into three iterative steps: defining system boundaries, setting research goals and questions, and quantifying components and relationships.
> 
> There are various methods for data collection, depending on the types collected. Different procedures are included in data analysis and integration, such as specialized statistical methods and geographic information systems. Systems modeling is broadly used to understand complex relationships and dynamics. Tools like GIS and computer software programs like R make data visually accessible in visualization processes.
> 
> 2.7 Model coupled systems
> Given resource constraints, innovative approaches are needed to study coupled systems, such as using model coupled systems studied in depth over time. This approach can inform research on non-model systems and contribute to understanding fundamental questions and developing effective policies related to system dynamics, interactions and scale-dependency. Wolong Nature Reserve in China serves as an example of such a model coupled system.
> 
> 2.8 Summary
> The coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach provides a comprehensive way to analyze reciprocal interactions and feedbacks between humans and nature. It is useful in characterizing complex interactions, contributing to various theories, and unifying diverse data sets. The chapter also underscores the importance of intensive, long-term study of model coupled systems.
