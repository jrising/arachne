**user**:
> I am trying to describe the status of several pieces of work (updating a complicated model) in a couple of words in a table. Roughly, the way I'm thinking of this is the following stages:
>  - Under development: I know what I want to do, but I need to try it out and work out the kinks.
>  - Developed: The plan works, but it's not built into the final model.
>  - Partially Incorporated: I've gotten some of the pieces into the model, but it's not done yet.
>  - Complete: It's in the model and ready to go.
> 
> But I'm not very happy with my terms here (Under development, Developed, Partially Incorporated). Can you suggest an alternative, easy-to-understand sequence?
**assistant**:
> Of course, I understand that you might want to use some more intuitive terms. Here's an alternative set of stages that may fit your needs:
> 
> 1. **Prototype**: This is similar to your "Under Development" phase, implying that you are still trying out ideas and working out the kinks.
> 2. **Refined**: Instead of "Developed", this term provides a sense of polish and evolution beyond the initial prototype, but not fully integrated into the full model.
> 3. **Integrated**: Replacing "Partially Incorporated", this term implies the stage where pieces have now been fitted into the model structure, even if not completely.
> 4. **Complete**: This stage remains as is, to signify the final stage where integration and testing are done, and the component is ready for use.
> 
> So, the revised sequence would be: Prototype, Refined, Integrated, and Complete.
