> Dear James,
> 
> I am hoping I can convince you to apply to our newly advertised faculty position in the Bren School at UCSB.  As you may have seen, we are looking for an exceptional environmental economist who uses modern data science as part of their research.  You were on the short list of people the search committee flagged as having exactly the kind of research trajectory we are looking for and I sincerely hope you will apply!
> 
> The full position details can be found here.  We are able to hire at the assistant or associate level and the salary will be very competitive.
> 
> I know that you already know about our group here, but let me provide some highlights.  First, we have a highly productive, collaborative and supportive group of environmental economists spread across several departments (Economics, Bren, Geography, Env. Studies); UCSB is an extremely productive place to work and we prioritize a healthy work/life balance.  Second, UCSB is highly interdisciplinary, but also rewards deep contributions in environmental economics.  I know that will resonate with you. Third, we have built a research center called the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) which is a great way to get involved (if you so choose) in applied economics research with agencies, NGOs, and other high-impact partners.  Finally, we are looking for an economist who can also contribute to our master's in environmental data science at the Bren School.
> 
> We sincerely hope you will apply and I would be happy to talk one-on-one with you if any questions arise.  Just let me know if that would be helpful and we can set up a time to talk.
