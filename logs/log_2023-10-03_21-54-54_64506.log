**user**:
> I am looking at restricted micro-level Census data to request. I see that some economic data is available at the firm level and some at the establishment level. What is the difference between these?
**assistant**:
> In the context of the Census data you are examining, "firm" and "establishment" are two distinct levels of economic data aggregation.
> 
> A "firm" is a business organization that operates one or more establishments. It contains all the operations, from manufacturing to sales, conducted by the business. If a company operates in several locations, each of these places is considered an "establishment." 
> 
> On the other hand, an "establishment" is a single physical location where business is conducted or services or industrial operations are performed. For example, a large corporation like Walmart is a single firm, but it operates thousands of establishments (stores), each located in different places.
> 
> When it comes to economic data, firm-level data often provides information about the overall performance, financial status, and strategic choices of a company. As such, it generally includes total revenues, business strategies, total workforce, etc.
> 
> Establishment-level data gives information about operations at individual business locations. This can include data on the number of employees at a specific location, the amount of output from a certain factory or store, or other measures of productivity or activity at the site.
> 
> Choosing between firm-level and establishment-level data will depend on the specific types of analysis you want to perform. Establishment-level data can be helpful for regional or local analyses, while firm-level data can be useful when researching firm-wide policies or overall company performance.
