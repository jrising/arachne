> How can I generate a unique random filename in a directory in python
**assistant**:
> Here's how you can generate a unique random filename in a directory with Python, using the `uuid` and `os` modules. The `uuid` module provides functionality to create universally unique identifiers, which can be used as filenames. It'll ensure uniqueness even across multiple runs of the script. The `os` module enables us to interact with the underlying operating system in various ways, like creating a file:
> 
> ```python
> import os
> import uuid
> 
> # Define the directory in which you want to create the file.
> # For example, let's take the current directory.
> directory = os.getcwd()
> 
> # Generate a random UUID.
> random_filename = str(uuid.uuid4())
> 
> # Combine directory path with the random filename.
> unique_file_path = os.path.join(directory, f'{random_filename}.txt')
> 
> # Now you can create a file with this unique name.
> with open(unique_file_path, "w") as file:
>     file.write("This is a unique file.")
> ```
> 
> In above code:
> 
> - `os.getcwd()` gets the current working directory. Replace it with your preferred directory.
> - `uuid.uuid4()` generates a random UUID.
> - `os.path.join(directory, f'{random_filename}.txt')` constructs a full file path.
> - The `with open` statement creates a new file with the unique filename, and writes a string to it.
