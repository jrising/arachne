**user**:
> How close to the direction of the wind could a 3-mast ship like the whaler Essex go?
**assistant**:
> The whaler Essex, like most 3-masted square-rigged sailing ships of its time, was able to sail approximately 60 to 70 degrees off the wind, a direction known as "close-hauled." This means that if the wind was coming from directly north, the ship could sail a course no closer than about northeast to northwest, but nothing closer to the wind direction. 
> 
> Keep in mind that the ship's ability to sail into the wind would also depend on several specific factors, including sail conditions, ship load, sea state, and the quality of the ship's rigging and design.
> 
> In sailing terminology, advancing in a direction upwind (toward the direction from which the wind is coming) is known as "beating" or "working to windward." The ship would have to move in a zigzag pattern, called "tacking" or "beating to windward," alternating between the two closest points they could sail towards the wind.
