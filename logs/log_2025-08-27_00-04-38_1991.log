**assistant**:
> It sounds like you're encountering an issue where the levels of a factor variable (`ISO` in this case) in the new data do not match those that were present when the model was originally fitted. This can commonly happen if a factor level was dropped during model fitting.
> 
> Here are some steps you can take to resolve this:
> 
> 1. **Check the Factor Levels:**
>    Ensure that the factor levels in your new data match exactly with those used when the model was built. You can do this by comparing the levels in both datasets:
> 
>    ```r
>    # Check levels in the model
>    levels_in_model <- levels(lmmod$model$ISO)
> 
>    # Check levels in the new data
>    levels_in_newdata <- levels(newdata$ISO)
> 
>    # Display
>    print(levels_in_model)
>    print(levels_in_newdata)
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Ensure Consistency:**
>    If the factor in your prediction dataset (`newdata`) doesn't include all the levels from the original dataset, or if it has new levels, set them to match:
> 
>    ```r
>    # Ensure 'ISO' in 'newdata' includes all levels from the model fit
>    newdata$ISO <- factor(newdata$ISO, levels = levels_in_model)
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Refit the Model if Needed:**
>    If possible, refit your model using a dataset that includes all potential levels of `ISO` you expect to encounter, even if some levels are empty. This prevents the issue at the prediction stage and ensures your model is robust to all expected input.
> 
> 4. **Use `contrasts.arg` Carefully:**
>    When fitting the model, ensure you have set the `contrasts.arg` correctly in `model.matrix()` to control which level gets the reference, especially if dealing with dropped levels:
> 
>    ```r
>    contrasts.arg = list(ISO = "contr.treatment")
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Use `predict` Without Factor Issues:**
>    Once factors are aligned, the `predict` function should work without errors:
> 
>    ```r
>    predictions <- predict(lmmod, newdata = newdata)
>    ```
> 
> By ensuring that your factor levels are aligned between the model fitting and prediction stages, you should avoid the "new levels" error and improve the reliability of your predictions. Let me know if you need more tailored advice!

**assistant**:
> It seems like you're trying to filter your dataset based on a specific condition related to the `Scenario` "CMIP6 No CC" and the `ISO` level "Africa/LatAm." If you're encountering the error specifically with this condition, it's likely that the factor levels are causing issues when you try to predict.

> ### Steps to Address the Dropped Level Issue
> 
> 1. **Check and Adjust Levels:**
>    First, ensure that the level "Africa/LatAm" is present in your original model's levels:
> 
>    ```r
>    # Check existing levels in the model
>    original_levels <- levels(lmmod$model$ISO)
>    print(original_levels)  # Check if "Africa/LatAm" is included
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Handle Dropped Levels:**
>    If "Africa/LatAm" is not in the original levels and is causing the prediction issue, consider including it in your new data. Here’s how you can do that:
> 
>    ```r
>    # Make sure newdata includes all factor levels
>    newdata$ISO <- factor(newdata$ISO, levels = c(original_levels, "Africa/LatAm"))
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Filter the Results:**
>    If you want to filter `results2` based on the conditions you specified, ensure you perform it after adjusting the factor levels:
> 
>    ```r
>    # Filtering based on the specified conditions
>    isdropped <- results2$Scenario == "CMIP6 No CC" | results2$ISO == "Africa/LatAm"
> 
>    # Apply the filter to get the relevant subset
>    filtered_results <- results2[isdropped, ]
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Predicting Without Errors:**
>    After addressing the factor levels, you can make your predictions as follows:
> 
>    ```r
>    predictions <- predict(lmmod, newdata = newdata)
>    ```
> 
> ### Additional Considerations
> 
> - If "Africa/LatAm" is not an intentional level (for example, if it was never present in the training data), you might want to revisit your analysis and clarify whether it should be included.
> - If you need to work with a model that can handle this new level effectively, consider retraining your model with the full factor levels or using techniques like one-hot encoding if applicable.
> 
> If you provide more context or specific code, I can give more precise guidance!
