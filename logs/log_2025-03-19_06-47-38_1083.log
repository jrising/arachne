The significant contribution of greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits opens up the promising opportunity of linking carbon finance to adaptation investments in these two sectors. Also, the high development benefits ensure high rates of return even if future extreme climate events do not occur.

Though they are at the center of adaptation concerns, these sub-sectors oddly have relatively lower average internal rates of return. This is likely due to the low level of benefits valuation in water project cost-benefit analysis. Both reflect among the lowest levels of valuation of all sub-sectors, along with health and disaster risk management, but lack the high values of human lives saved lift their internal rates of return. On average, water projects have relatively fewer induced development benefits compared to dividends one and three, which suggests a low valuation of these benefit types.

These investments are robust, generate benefits independent of actual future climate impacts, and can measurably reduce climate risks. Many such projects implement low-regret and relatively low-cost actions to reduce climate risks. They also help integrate adaptation into decisions with long lifetimes to avoid lock-in effects or future maladaptation.
