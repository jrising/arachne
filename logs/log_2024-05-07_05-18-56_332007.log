> Corporate Engagement Opportunities (CEO)
> Program
> Today, many cities, counties and states have climate action goals that require reducing the energy in existing
> buildings. To meet these goals, more than 40 jurisdictions have publicly committed to passing a building
> performance standard (BPS) by 2024 through the National BPS Coalition, representing a major shift in building
> operations. Alongside this influx of policy development, building owners, energy providers, climate risk assessors,
> and lenders need to prepare for compliance in an effort to quantify and mitigate the substantial fees that these
> policies can carry. Many building owners aren’t aware of these policies, and may be at risk of noncompliance or of
> missing strategic opportunities.
