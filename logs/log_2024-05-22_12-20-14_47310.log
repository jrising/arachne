> I'm setting up a custom RSS aggregator, and I want to include material from email lists. I'm imagining doing something like setting up automatic forwards from my inbox to another email address and then having those either get listed in an RSS feed I set up. How can I do this in a way that will require minimal maintenance going forward?
**assistant**:
> That sounds like an interesting project! Setting up an RSS feed to aggregate material from emails can be done fairly straightforwardly using a combination of existing tools and a bit of custom coding. Here is a step-by-step plan to create a minimal-maintenance system:
> 
> ### Step-by-Step Guide
> 
> 1. **Set Up Auto-Forwarding from Your Email**:
>    - Configure your email client to automatically forward specific emails (from your desired email lists) to a designated email address. 
>    - For example, you can set up a filter in Gmail to forward emails from particular senders.
> 
> 2. **Create a Dedicated Email Account**:
>    - Set up a new email account solely for the purpose of receiving forwarded emails. This keeps things organized and minimizes the risk of missing important personal emails.
> 
> 3. **Access Emails Programmatically**:
>    - Use a service like [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) or [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) that allows you to receive incoming emails and process them with a webhook. This webhook will notify your server and allow you to handle the email contents.
>    - If you prefer not to use an external service, you can periodically fetch emails using IMAP with a Python package like `imaplib`.
> 
> 4. **Parse Emails into RSS Items**:
>    - Write a script that parses the relevant information from each email (subject, date, body, etc.) and converts it into the standardized format for an RSS feed.
>    - A simple Python script can do this using modules like `email`, `feedgenerator`, and `beautifulsoup4` if needed for HTML parsing.
> 
> 5. **Generate and Serve the RSS Feed**:
>    - Use a library like `feedgenerator` to create an RSS feed. Hereâ€™s a small example of how you could add items to an RSS feed:
> 
>      ```python
>      from feedgenerator import Rss201rev2Feed
> 
>      feed = Rss201rev2Feed(
>          title="Email List Aggregator",
>          link="http://yourdomain.com/rss",
>          description="Aggregated content from email lists",
>      )
>      
>      # Extract this information from your parsed emails
>      feed.add_item(
>          title="Email Subject",
>          link="http://example.com/email-link",
>          description="Email body content or excerpt",
>          pubdate=datetime.datetime.now(),
>      )
>      
>      with open('rss_feed.xml', 'w') as fp:
>          feed.write(fp, 'utf-8')
>      ```
> 
> 6. **Host the RSS Feed**:
>    - Host the RSS feed on a web server. You can use services like GitHub Pages, AWS S3, or any web hosting service to serve the XML file.
>    - Automate the updating of the RSS feed by scheduling a script to run periodically with cron jobs or using a continuous deployment pipeline based on new incoming emails.
> 
> ### Minimal Maintenance Tips
> 
> - **Automation**: Automate as much as possible. Use scripts to handle email fetching, parsing, and RSS feed generation.
> - **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement robust error handling and logging in your scripts to catch issues before they become problematic.
> - **Regular Updates**: Set up automated tasks (like cron jobs) so the system can check and update the RSS feed regularly.
> - **Monitoring**: Tools like cron job monitoring services or basic health checks on your scripts can alert you if something goes down.
