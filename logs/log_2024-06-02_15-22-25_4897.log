**assistant**:
> To impose a time-out on a function in Python, you can use the `timeout_decorator` library. Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use it:
> 
> First, you need to install the library:
> ```bash
> pip install timeout-decorator
> ```
> 
> Then, you can use the `timeout` decorator from the library to set a time limit on a function:
> 
> ```python
> from timeout_decorator import timeout
> 
> # Define a function that you want to impose a time-out on
> @timeout(5)  # Set the time-out to 5 seconds
> def my_function():
>     # Code that may take longer than the time-out limit
>     while True:
>         pass
> 
> # Call the function
> try:
>     my_function()
> except TimeoutError:
>     print("Function timed out")
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> - The `@timeout(5)` decorator is used to set a time-out of 5 seconds for the `my_function`.
> - If the function takes longer than 5 seconds to execute, a `TimeoutError` will be raised.
> - You can catch this exception and handle it as needed (e.g., print a message).
> 
> This method allows you to control the execution time of a function and handle cases where a function may run indefinitely.
