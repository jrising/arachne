> Dear CSEi Executive Committee,
> 
> I am very excited to apply to an Assistant Professor position in the new Climate Systems Engineering initiative at the University of Chicago. I believe that my existing research provides a firm basis for contributing to the Initiative and for pivoting into more extensive work on climate systems engineering, which I consider to be one of the most important open issues today.
> 
> My research is on the interactions between economic and environmental systems, aimed at identifying policy opportunities for their effective management. My work is quantitative and interdisciplinary, grounded in environmental economics and drawing upon methods from multiple fields. I see integrated modeling and analysis as a cornerstone to evaluating potential risks and opportunities involved in the active management of the earth system. My research statement describes how my existing work on the risks of climate change and integrated modeling support CSEi’s vision.
> 
> Beyond my research, I have actively worked to connect research to policy-making. I have coordinated stakeholder and interdisciplinary researcher workshops and advised government and intergovernmental bodies such as the EPA, CEA, the UK’s CCC, and IPBES.
> 
> Since participating in a student-teaching program while at M.I.T., teaching both official and unofficial classes has had a central role in my career. I have developed four courses at the University of Delaware, on the analysis of complex systems, the economics of climate change, human-natural coupled systems, and the philosophy of research.
> 
> I believe that a position in the Climate Systems Engineering initiative would be an excellent fit for my interests and experience and look forward to connecting with you. Please feel free to reach me either by phone, at 1 202 657 2377, or by email, at jrising@udel.edu.

> Dear CSEi Executive Committee,
> 
> I write to you with great enthusiasm to apply for the Assistant Professor position in the Climate Systems Engineering initiative at the University of Chicago. As a researcher whose work is deeply ingrained in the intersections of economic and environmental systems, I believe I can bring a unique perspective and contribute significantly to the Initiative. Further, this position aligns well with my interest in climate systems engineering, an area I regard as one of the most crucial unsolved matters of our time.
> 
> My research pursuits revolve around the effective management of economic and environmental systems, with the objective of unveiling policy opportunities. The quantitative, interdisciplinary nature of my work, grounded in environmental economics, incorporates methodologies from a diverse range of fields. I view integrated modeling and analysis as an essential tool for evaluating the prospective risks and opportunities inherent in active Earth systems management. My attached research statement offers insight into the integrative role my work on climate change risks and modeling plays in supporting CSEi's vision.
> 
> Complementing my research, I have been actively involved in bridging the gap between academia and policy-making. I have convened stakeholder and interdisciplinary researcher workshops, and provided counsel to governmental and intergovernmental bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
> 
> Educational outreach holds a pivotal role in my career stemming from my time as a participant in a student-teaching program at M.I.T. I have since developed four multidisciplinary courses at the University of Delaware - deciphering complex systems, economics of climate change, exploration into human-natural coupled systems, and understanding the philosophy of research.
> 
> The opportunity to serve in the Climate Systems Engineering initiative aligns seamlessly with my academic interests, professional journey, and future aspirations. I am ardently looking forward to the possibility of establishing connections with you, and discussing my potential contributions to the initiative. I am readily available for contact either via phone, at 1 202 657 2377, or by email at jrising@udel.edu.
