> As an AI, I don't directly track success or have an organization. However, I can provide an example of how the given organization might track its success based on the described goals and program activities. 
> 
> The given organization, let's call it the "Energy Efficiency Hub", is aiming to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce energy costs, particularly for frontline communities. Here is a potential way the Energy Efficiency Hub could track its success:
> 
> 1. **Increased Energy Efficiency**: This can be measured by reductions in energy use in buildings where the Hub's advice, technical assistance, and educational resources have been used. Energy use information can be collected before and after efficiency measures are implemented, and compared to track improvements.
> 
> 2. **Reduced Energy Costs**: The Hub can work with landlords and tenants in the frontline communities to collect information on energy bills before and after using the Hubâ€™s guidance. It can calculate the reductions in cost as a measure of success. 
> 
> 3. **Number of Community Buildings Implementing Energy Efficiency Measures**: The Hub could also track success by counting the number of buildings in frontline communities that have implemented the suggested measures, thereby actively improving their climates resiliency.
> 
> 4. **Policy Influence**: Success could also be gauged by the local, state or national policy changes influenced by the Hub's work. 
> 
> 5. **Promoting Best Practices**: The Hub could assess its success in best practice promotion based on the uptake rate of its recommendations.
> 
> In all these ways, the Energy Efficiency Hub could track its success based on specific, measurable changes that reflect the organization's goals.
