**user**:
> How can I make a function to load something in R where the variables all end up in the global environment?
**assistant**:
> You can use the `assign()` function in R to put variables into the global environment. Here is an example function that creates two variables, `df1` and `df2`:
> 
> ```R
> load_stuff_to_global <- function() {
>   # Create some example data frames
>   df1 <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)
>   df2 <- data.frame(x = letters[1:3], y = LETTERS[1:3])
> 
>   # Use assign() to put df1 and df2 in the global environment
>   assign("df1", df1, envir = .GlobalEnv)
>   assign("df2", df2, envir = .GlobalEnv)
> }
> ```
> 
> Every time you run `load_stuff_to_global()`, it will put `df1` and `df2` into the global environment, overwriting any existing variables with those names.
> 
> However, as a good practice, it's worth noting that using the global environment this way is generally discouraged in R, as it can easily lead to confusion and is contrary to the principles of functional programming. Instead, consider returning a list of variables from your function and using `list2env()` function to assign them names in the local environment/ required environment. 
> 
> This could be done like below:
> 
> ```R
> my_function <- function() {
>     # some computations
>     df1 <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)
>     df2 <- data.frame(x = letters[1:3], y = LETTERS[1:3])
>     
>     list(df1 = df1, df2 = df2)
> }
> 
> variables <- my_function()
> list2env(variables, envir = .GlobalEnv)
> ```
> 
> In this manner, it's clear when and where names are being created in the global environment.
