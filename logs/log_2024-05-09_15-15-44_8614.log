> Summary
> Evolution of international climate change policy and processes commenced in 1990 with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which made the first global attempt to provide an intergovernmental platform for addressing the effects of climate change. Since then, major advances in the international dialog occurred from 1995 to 2004 during the Kyoto Protocol. However, the Kyoto Protocol outcome was not considered a major success in terms of reducing global emissions, although it succeeded in advancing global market-based flexible mitigation mechanisms, such as emissions trading, joint implementation, and the clean development mechanism. A turnaround in the global approach occurred with the Paris Agreement in 2015, which represented a major turning point in the climate debate, with a bottom-up approach allowing states to set their own emission targets. In addition, the Paris Agreement was the catalyst for formation of bodies and institutions that promote negotiated climate change themes and has permitted countries to work together to share direct practical approaches for tackling climate change. The success of the Paris Agreement can be seen as more countries commit to nationally determined contribution targets. In addition, the practical implication of the bottom-up approach for institutional investors and corporate engagement is evident from the increase in the number of global climate change litigation cases brought against corporations and financial institutions that breach climate change obligations. Going forward, some of the climate change negotiation issues of concern that have yet to be resolved include the differences in contributions required by developed nations as opposed to developing nations, sometimes referred to as the North–South divide in climate change negotiations, the issue of loss and damage associated with climate change events, such as tropical cyclones and storms, and how to account for non-economic loss and damage caused by climate change events.

> Introduction
> Climate change has emerged as one of the greatest challenges that the global community is facing. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly fossil fuel-based carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, are causing an increase of average temperature, sea-level rise, melting of glaciers, and other environmental changes in the world (Böhringer, 2003, p. 451). As early as 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its First Assessment Report (AR1) presented the scientific assessment of factors that may affect climate change; developed models

> of climate change predictions, including sea-level rise and the effects on ecosystems; and advocated the importance of reducing global warming through international exchange of climate data and policy development (IPCC, 1990, p. 1).
> The IPCC, an international expert body on climate change established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, provides governments with “regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks” (IPCC, 2021a). The IPCC, with the assistance of thousands of scientists from all over the world, prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about “the state of scientific, technical and socioeconomic knowledge on climate change” (IPCC, 2021a).
> The AR1 of the IPCC provided a comprehensive understanding of human-induced changes in climate systems and the likely staggering impacts of such changes, and it identified the options for mitigation from the energy, industry, agriculture, and forestry sectors (Gupta, 2010; Howarth & Painter, 2016, p. 2). The report was rapidly accepted as “the most authoritative consensus knowledge on climate change” and was considered an important underpinning for negotiation of the UNFCCC (Bassewitz, 2013; Gupta, 2010; Kreienkamp, 2019, p. 3).
> In its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014, the IPCC reiterated the reasons for concern regarding climate change, such as unique and threatened systems, extreme weather events, distribution of impacts between groups of people and between regions, risks of global aggregate impacts, and an increase in large-scale singular events (IPCC, 2014, p. 72). AR5 informed the negotiations and policy formulation for the Paris Agreement (United Nations Climate Change, 2021).
> The latest projections about carbon emission and global temperature were illustrated in the report of Working Group I of the Sixth Assessment Report, published on August 9, 2021:
> Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least the mid-century under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades (IPCC, 2021b).
> The IPCC reports help national governments, national policymakers, and the national negotiators who attend the regular UNFCCC meetings to get the most credible, authoritative, and latest information on climate change (Howarth & Painter, 2016, p. 10). The Conference of the Parties (COP) as well as the UNFCCC organs, particularly the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, cooperate closely with the IPCC for objective scientific and technical advice (United Nations Climate Change, 2021). Thus, IPCC assessment reports contribute to the COP negotiations and the development of climate change policies in the UNFCCC framework.
> Given that both the origin and the effects of climate change are global, international, and regional, cooperation on adaptation and mitigation is required to address its multilevel causes and impacts and to hold the global average temperature below the threshold level. Cooperation involves a continuous process of negotiation and discussion among multilevel stakeholders,

> including national and local governments, policymakers, international organizations, private sectors, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. This was an arduous and challenging task, as many obstacles were faced in the 1990s and early 2000s in building a consensus on international climate policy for many reasons, including “the large uncertainties in the science of climate change and the fundamental incentive problems of sovereign
> states” (Böhringer, 2003, p. 461).
> Bodansky (2016) described how the international climate change regime has had three distinct
> phases:
> 1. The first phase (1990–1995) was the building stage, involving “the negotiation, adoption, and entry into force of the UNFCCC.”
> 2. The second phase (1995–2004) was the advancing stage, with the Kyoto Protocol negotiations and the protocol’s entry into force.
> 3. The third and current phase (2005–current) is the adoption stage, starting with the Paris Agreement in 2015, which has provided an opportunity for involvement through a wide variety of pledges by public and private actors, including countries, regions, cities, international organizations, businesses, and the NGOs (Bodansky, 2016, p. 291).
> Major landmarks in this evolution include the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, and the Paris Agreement in 2015 (Kuyper et al., 2018, p. 344). The UNFCCC is the main global forum for climate change negotiations. Since its adoption in 1992, negotiations have proceeded in various areas or themes, including mitigation, adaptation, climate finance, technology, capacity-building, and transparency. Although in the three decades since the beginning of its journey the UNFCCC has achieved tremendous progress on various fronts, including conceptual setting, operational procedure, financial mechanism, capacity-building, and institution-building, the global aspiration to reduce GHG emissions has failed to achieve its target, as indicated in the report of Working Group I of the Sixth Assessment Report (Kuyper et al., 2018, p. 344).
> This article aims to provide an overview of the development of the global climate change regime, including its historical background and its origin, as well as the evolution of the UNFCCC processes, such as the Kyoto Protocol, that have occurred via COP, along with the results achieved. The article explores the shift in approach from legally binding, nationally determined contributions pledged by industrialized countries through the Kyoto Protocol to voluntary contributions through the Paris Agreement, which allows both state and nonstate actors (such as institutional investors and corporations) to take on wider roles and approaches in tackling climate change. The objective of the article is to give the reader an insight into the effect of the Paris Agreement, which is still evolving as the goal is broadened from just mitigation to include adaptation and finance.

>  The First Phase—Adoption of UNFCCC
> The starting point for a discussion of global international obligations on climate change is the UNFCCC. In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change to prepare the text with appropriate commitments for an effective framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC, 2021b).
> By the time of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, there was global recognition that GHG emissions needed to be curbed to save the planet from overwhelming disasters. Thus, evolving international concern about accelerated global warming and sea-level rise led to the adoption of the UNFCCC to provide an institutional framework for international climate policy.
> The UNFCCC was opened for signatures at the 1992 Earth Summit and was adopted in the same year. However, it entered into force on March 21, 1994, 90 days after receiving its 50th ratification. Eventually, it has been widely ratified by the majority of countries. As of May 2021, 196 countries and the European Union were parties to it (UNFCCC, 2021a).
> The UNFCCC followed a unique “convention-protocol approach” under which, as a first step, it adopted a framework convention that established the objectives, the institutional architecture, and the process (Kuyper et al., 2018, p. 345). The second step involved the agreed commitments to achieve its ultimate objective (Article 2) through subsequent protocols (Kuyper et al., 2018, p. 345). In order to facilitate and review efforts to attain the objectives, the Convention established an annual forum, the COP, to further international discussions about stabilizing GHG in the atmosphere.
> While the UNFCCC specified the urgency of taking action on global anthropogenic climate change and set aims and targets to achieve this, it did not have country agreements on specific emissions reductions. However, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement have been adopted by many countries to supplement the UNFCCC aims and have set more binding targets for GHG emission reductions.

>  Evolution of the International Climate Change Policy and Processes: UNFCCC to Paris Agreement
> In response to the global concern about accelerated anthropogenic climate change, Article 2 of the UNFCCC set the long-term objective of the framework as stabilization of global GHG concentrations at such a level that “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” can be resisted (United Nations [UN], 1992). This aim has been criticized by scholars as “a weak and vague target” (Kuyper et al., 2018, p. 346). O’Neill and Oppenheimer (2002) argued that the “dangerous interference” can be viewed from a “variety of perspectives, and the choice will ultimately involve a mixture of scientific, economic, political, ethical, and cultural considerations, among others” (O’Neill & Oppenheimer, 2002, p. 1971). Furthermore, there was uncertainty about the links between climate change and its impacts, and the concept of “dangerous” was interpreted differently over time (O’Neill & Oppenheimer, 2002, p. 1971). Kuyper et al. (2018) confirmed that even three decades after its inception, the objective of limiting “dangerous interference” is “interpreted more politically than scientifically” (Kuyper et al., 2018, p. 346).
> Since the UNFCCC practices decision-making by consensus, the Convention only had a nonbinding aim to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. This was due to a lack of political agreement among states regarding binding reduction commitments (Kuyper et al., 2018, p. 345). However, the Convention did provide guidance on the implementation of commitments; for example, Article 4.8 requires parties to give consideration to the specific needs and concerns of developing countries and other parties, such as countries with low-lying coastal areas and others that are adversely affected by climate change.
> The UNFCCC recognized the differences in the capability of developing countries by adopting the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This principle has two limbs: first, it recognizes the “different historical responsibilities of parties for causing the climate change problem,” and, second, it considers the difference in capabilities in addressing the issue (Bodansky, 2016, p. 298). While the Convention established both common obligations for all parties, it also differentiated obligations for parties listed in Annexes I and II of the Convention (Articles 3 and 4 of the UNFCCC). However, this categorization is not a permanent phenomenon. It can evolve and change over time, and indeed with changes in the parties’ responsibilities and capabilities, the categorization needs to be adjusted over time. For example, countries may move from non-Annex I to Annex I status as their responsibilities and capabilities change. The UNFCCC will from time to time review progress and amend the status accordingly (Bodansky, 2016, p. 298).
> The significant achievement of the UNFCCC was that, for the first time, the global community recognized the importance of working together to address anthropogenic climate change despite the uncertainty that was still prevalent about the causes of global warming and the extent and effects of climate change (Bassewitz, 2013). Although the UNFCCC did not contain any specific national or international targets to curb GHG emissions, it introduced some fundamental points and processes that were catalysts in subsequent climate change debates and processes.

>  Evolution of the International Climate Change Policy and Processes: UNFCCC to Paris Agreement
> The Second Phase—Adoption of the Kyoto Protocol
> The Kyoto Protocol was the first legally binding international agreement to limit GHG emissions for climate protection (Barrett, 1998, p. 20; Böhringer, 2003, p. 463). It was achieved after more than 10 years of climate-policy negotiations and was considered to be a preliminary step in implementing the aims and goals of the UNFCCC. It was negotiated in December 1997 during COP 3. During negotiation, while the European Union pressed for an overall target of bringing GHG emissions down to 15% below 1990 levels by 2010, the United States, on the contrary, wanted to set a target of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels in the same period. The United States also pushed for bringing major developing countries under binding mitigation commitments.
> Eventually, the Kyoto Protocol specified differentiated emission targets for industrialized countries, called Annex I countries. Accordingly, the industrialized countries—as listed in its Annex B—committed themselves to reduce their GHG emissions by 5.2% on average below aggregate 1990 emission levels during the commitment period 2008–2012 (Böhringer, 2003, p. 457). The non-Annex I countries were, however, exempt from any emission reduction. Developed countries and developing countries had different roles under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. As the Kyoto Protocol was being developed, it was recognized that most of the GHG pollution currently in the atmosphere was from developed countries. It was felt that it was not fair that developing countries, which had played little role in creating the problem, be required to reduce emissions and perhaps delay their economic growth. Thus, no control over the emissions of developing countries was imposed by the Protocol (Barrett, 1998, p. 27).
> The growth of emissions from 1990 to 2011 from Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 countries can be seen in figure 1. The overall growth of global GHG emissions by 50% between 1990 and 2018 is evident in figure 2.

> With an increase in emissions from developing countries, a second commitment required all developed country governments and 48 developing countries to pledge to emission reductions. The outcome of COP 17, held in Durban in 2011, was a second commitment, to run from 2013 to 2020, to reduce the GHG emissions by at least 18% below 1990 levels.
> Klein et al. (2017) highlighted that the Kyoto Protocol initiated a number of “new concepts for the climate change regime, or at least significantly expanded on existing ones” (Klein et al., 2017, pp. 33–34). Notably, it introduced three market-based flexible mechanisms—emissions trading (Article 17), joint implementation (JI), and the clean development mechanism (CDM)—which have the “potential of supporting a cost-effective final allocation of climate-change
> mitigation” (Barrett, 1998, p. 27). JI
> The JI mechanism, as defined in Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol, is a project-based mechanism under which any Annex I country can earn “emission reduction units” (ERUs) for undertaking an emission-reduction or emission-removal project in any other Annex I country. This allows a developed country with a relatively high cost of domestic GHG reduction to set up a project in another developed country that has relatively low cost and earn carbon credits that may be applied to their emission targets. A study undertaken by Stockholm Environment Institute

> examined a random sample of 60 JI projects and found that 80% of the ERUs issued came from projects of low or questionable environmental integrity. The study also found that 95% of ERUs were issued by countries that had surpluses of allowances, making it questionable whether the ERUs represent actual emission reductions (Stockholm Environment Institute, 2015). The JI guidelines were reviewed in 2015 and the JI mechanism was extended to 2020, with improved international oversight and with existing projects being reassessed under the new rules (UN, 2015).
> CDM
> Built on the JI concept, the CDM was introduced to include non-Annex I countries in the carbon emission effort. The CDM mechanism, as defined in Article 12, allows a country with an emission- reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to meet their emission target by undertaking an emission-reduction project in developing countries that provides “additional” and “certified” emission reductions (Kyoto Protocol, Article 12; Barrett, 1998, p. 30). Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to 1 ton of carbon dioxide, which can be counted toward meeting Kyoto targets. The CDM was designed to meet a dual objective: to help developed countries fulfill their commitments to reduce emissions, and to assist developing countries in achieving sustainable development. The CDM is a remarkably innovative way of involving the non-Annex I, potentially developing countries in emission-reduction efforts under the Kyoto framework (Barrett, 1998, p. 30). Rosencranz and Jamwal (2020) criticized the CDM as giving the developed nations a “right to pollute,” frustrating the core essence of the common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the UNFCCC (Rosencranz & Jamwal, 2020, p. 292).
> However, the future of CDM is unclear; the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol came to an end on December 31, 2020, and the focus shifted to the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. Thus, after 2020, there was no legal basis for the CDM to issue CERs (Legal Response International [LRI], 2019).
> Emissions Trading
> Barrett (1998) considered emissions trading among Annex I countries “the most important flexible mechanism in the Kyoto agreement” (Barrett, 1998, p. 29). Emissions trading, as set out in Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol, allows countries that have emission units to spare—emissions permitted to them but not “used”—to sell this excess capacity to countries that are over their targets. Thus, a new market-based approach was introduced to control pollution. Since carbon dioxide is the principal GHG, people speak simply of trading in carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are now tracked and traded like any other commodity. This is known as the “carbon market.” However, most carbon-trading schemes have been operated within countries, not across countries, since caps for individual countries have not been established.

>  
>  Evolution of the International Climate Change Policy and Processes: UNFCCC to Paris Agreement
> There are two main types of carbon pricing: emissions trading systems (ETS) and carbon taxes. The choice of the instrument will depend on national and economic circumstances. An ETS— sometimes referred to as a cap-and-trade system—caps the total level of GHG emissions and allows those industries with low emissions to sell their extra allowances to larger emitters. A carbon tax directly sets a price on carbon by defining a tax rate on GHG emissions or—more commonly—on the carbon content of fossil fuels. It is different from an ETS in that the emission- reduction outcome of a carbon tax is not predefined, but the carbon price is.
> Despite the introduction of the three market-based flexible mechanisms, a major hurdle to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol during finalization of the operational details was that U.S. President George W. Bush declared in 2001 that the United States would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, calling it “an unfair and ineffective means of addressing global climate change concerns” (Bush, 2001, p. 391). This announcement led to uncertainty about fulfilling the requirements of entry into force of the treaty, which requires ratification by no less than 55 countries representing at least 55% of the total carbon emissions of Annex I countries in 1990 (Article 25.1 of UNFCCC). However, with Russia’s ratification in 2005, the Protocol entered into force on February 16, 2005.
> Scholars have had mixed reactions to the Kyoto Protocol. Supporters of the Protocol consider it a “milestone” in international climate policy as well as in international efforts to mitigate global warming through emission reductions (Böhringer, 2003, p. 457). Böhringer (2003) mentioned specifically two reasons why the Kyoto Protocol was a “breakthrough in international climate policy”:
> (i) it promised—under the original provisions—substantial emission reductions for the developed world vis-à-vis business-as-usual (BaU) emissions, and (ii) it established a broad international mechanism for widening and deepening climate protection activities in the future (Böhringer, 2003, p. 452).
> Opponents of the Protocol criticized it as a “deeply flawed agreement that manages to be both economically inefficient and politically impractical” (McKibbin & Wilcoxen, 2002, p. 107, as cited in Böhringer, 2003, pp. 452, 463). Raising questions about the definition and certainty of long- term objectives (O’Neill & Oppenheimer, 2002, p. 1971), the critics viewed the Protocol as bound to fail because of its “flawed architecture” setting out “an unrealistic and inappropriate
> goal” (Böhringer, 2003, p. 459; McKibbin & Wilcoxen, 2002, p. 127).
> Böhringer (2003) identified defects of the Kyoto Protocol, such as its success was tied to the success of emissions trading at an international level and it did not provide for adequate monitoring and enforcement of these rights.
> However, the main criticism of the Kyoto Protocol was that it did not compel the developing countries that have emerged as major carbon emitters, including China and India, to take action. Furthermore, it allowed developed nations to offset their reduction obligation through flexible market-based mechanisms (Gupta, 2010).

> Despite these criticisms, it can be concluded that the Kyoto Protocol established “a flexible, broad-based, international mechanism” that led the way for further policy processes and for shaping effective climate policies to address the challenges posed by climate change (Böhringer, 2003, pp. 451, 463). Its major tenet was the promise by industrialized countries to reduce their emissions to a pledged target. Although the Kyoto Protocol did not achieve the desired global emission reductions (as demonstrated in figures 1 and 2), some issues that it raised are still being discussed today, such as the responsibilities of developed versus developing nations.
> Third Phase—Paris Agreement (2005–Current)
> The Road to the Paris Agreement
> The Paris Agreement is the outcome of international efforts to conclude a universal multilateral agreement on climate change. While the Paris Agreement is the “culmination of the third phase of the United Nations climate change regime” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 291), it had to make a long journey to accomplish this. Since the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period was limited to a certain time period (2008–2012), by 2005 the parties to the Kyoto Protocol felt the necessity of beginning negotiation to determine the emission reduction mechanism for after 2012 (Bodansky, 2016, p. 291). Given that the United States, China, and other major economies were outside the binding commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, a robust “global approach” was promoted by some stakeholders (Bodansky, 2016, p. 291). Among others, the Copenhagen architecture in 2009, Cancún Agreements in 2010, Warsaw decision in 2013, and Lima decision in 2014 acted as building blocks that led to the understanding and acceptance of the broad outlines of the Paris Agreement (Bodansky, 2016, p. 318).
> 2007—COP 13 in Bali
> COP 13 in Bali was significant in many ways. The negotiations for a post-Kyoto treaty started formally at COP 13. Parties affirmed their commitment to work together to address the challenges posed by climate change and realized the need to adopt an international agreement for the post-2012 Kyoto Protocol regime (Warner, 2011, p. 7). The COP adopted the Bali Action Plan to initiate a way to “a new inclusive climate agreement” (Kreienkamp, 2019, p. 8). The plan was founded on four key themes: mitigation, adaptation, technology, and finance. The plan urged the state parties to implement the UNFCCC and urgently recognized the need to reach an agreement at COP 15. Inspired by the “shared vision for long-term cooperation,” the COP established the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action under the UNFCCC, transforming the informal “UNFCCC track” negotiations into a formal negotiation process. Another major development at this meeting was that developing countries agreed to take on nationally appropriate mitigation actions, and in return, developed countries agreed to extend cooperation by providing support in the form of technology transfer, financing, and capacity-building. Also, the concept of loss and damage in the context of climate change risks was introduced in the Bali Action Plan. The parties to the Bali Action Plan agreed to work on national adaption planning, finance, and loss and damage.

> 2009—COP 15 in Copenhagen
> Since no concrete directions with respect to post-Kyoto emission-reduction mechanisms were available at the time, negotiations continued in two parallel streams: (a) establishing a second commitment period by way of amending the Kyoto Protocol and (b) promoting “long-term cooperative action” under the UNFCCC. However, both tracks were resolved at the 2009 Copenhagen Conference with adoption of the Copenhagen Accord on the final night of the conference (Bodansky, 2016, p. 292).
> Despite strong support by some key developing countries, including China and Brazil, for “an indefinite continuation of the Kyoto Protocol” to 2015, it was understood by the parties that the future climate agreement was going to be “a single agreement applicable to all
> parties” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 318).
> While the Copenhagen Conference raised enormous hope, partially due to the “Hopenhagen” campaign, it ultimately resulted in frustration and disappointment, particularly among developing nations, and the Accord failed to receive “acceptance from the conference as a
> whole” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 305). However, the Copenhagen Accord set a new approach for international climate negotiations “toward a more bottom-up, global approach” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 305). The Accord is remarkably different from the Kyoto Protocol in at least two respects. First, while for the Kyoto Protocol the parties undertook global negotiations to set out emission- reduction targets, under the Accord the countries defined their own actions and targets, establishing a bottom-up architecture (Bodansky, 2016, p. 292). Second, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Accord eroded “the sharp differentiation between developed and developing country parties” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 305). For the first time, developing nations, such as India, Brazil, and China, “put forward national emission limitation pledges.”
> 2010—COP 16 in Cancún
> The key elements of the Copenhagen Accord, including the pledges made by countries to reduce their emissions, were incorporated into the UNFCCC regime through the Cancún Agreements adopted at COP 16 in 2010. For the first time, the aim to limit the global temperature rise to 2°C was officially proclaimed in international climate policy. However, “the Copenhagen/Cancún pledges addressed only the period through 2020, leaving open what to do next,” and whether the Kyoto Protocol would be continued beyond 2012 was not decided in Cancún (Bodansky, 2016, p. 292). Another limitation of the Cancún Agreements was that being merely part of the COP decisions it did not have any binding authority, as it was .
> 2011—COP 17 in Durban
> Given that the Copenhagen Accord and Cancún Agreements were not regarded as the conclusive outcome of the Bali Action Plan process and they did not have any binding force, many countries were demanded “adoption of a new legal agreement” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 295). The 2011 COP 17 kept this aspiration in context and adopted the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, which “resolved these issues through a finely balanced compromise among the principal negotiating

> blocs in the UNFCCC process” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 293). The important outcome of the Durban Platform was a commitment by both developed and developing nations to enter into the outcome of the negotiations (UNFCCC, 2012, Decision 1/CP.17, paragraph 2), and no reference to categories, such as developing and developed, was mentioned in the decision.
> 2012—COP 18 in Doha
> COP 18, held in Doha, set up the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to negotiate a new global legal framework covering all countries by 2015. Later, the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform (ADP) was established. The most important outcome in Doha was that the second commitment period (2013–2020) for the Kyoto Protocol was adopted by the parties.
> 2013—COP 19 in Warsaw
> Notwithstanding the uncertainty about the post-Kyoto carbon reduction mechanism, there was a milestone achievement for developing countries specifically vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in 2013 at COP 19 held in Warsaw, Poland. COP 19 established the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts, which “created an institutionalized policy space to address the adverse consequences of climate change” (Vanhala & Hestbaek, 2016, p. 112).
> In Warsaw, the parties agreed on a time plan for countries to table their intended contributions to the new global climate agreement and on ways to accelerate efforts before 2020. It also set up a mechanism to address losses and damage caused by climate change in vulnerable developing countries. By this time the ADP had focused on the form and content of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the process for meeting the deadline on agreeing to a successor instrument by COP 21 in Paris in 2015. Parties were required to submit their national contributions for inclusion in the instrument.
> 2014—COP 20 in Lima
> In 2014, the Lima Decision required all countries to describe their intended contributions for the 2015 agreement clearly, transparently, and understandably. Also, the parties agreed on draft elements for the agreement and on accelerating the pre-2020 action. Accordingly, more than 180 states submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) before the Paris conference began. In the meantime, the ADP submitted a draft negotiating text in February 2015. Finally, the ADP concluded its work at the end of the first week in Paris, forwarding its draft negotiating text to ministers, who arrived in the second week, with the aim of pointing out the important issues for them to resolve and that were likely to make or break the Paris Agreement (Bodansky, 2016, p. 293).

>  Evolution of the International Climate Change Policy and Processes: UNFCCC to Paris Agreement
> Paris Agreement Adopted
> The Paris Agreement was adopted at COP 21 in Paris on December 12, 2015, entered into force on November 4, 2016, and as of 29 August 2022, 193 parties (192 countries plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement. Article 2 of the Paris Agreement reaffirmed the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Although uncertainty surrounds the 1.5° goal, it offers strength and motivation to activists to “push states and other actors to take stronger action” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 303).
> The purpose of the Paris Agreement was to improve on the Kyoto Protocol’s commitment to reduce emissions. The aim was to bring about economic and social transformation, based on the best available technology. The approach adopted was changed from Kyoto’s top-down approach to a bottom-up approach, whereby parties made their own commitment. Article 4 stated the bottom-up architecture of the Paris Agreement, whereby countries pledge Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to achieve the goal set out in the Agreement (see Bodansky et al., 2017, pp. 231–234). However, mitigation through NDCs under the Paris Agreement is substantially different from the Kyoto Protocol’s emission targets. The NDCs are nationally determined, with no legal obligation or compulsion to achieve them, and they are applied to all parties, including developing countries and not just Annex 1 Parties. In addition, countries are required to formulate long-term low GHG emission development strategies. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol’s emission targets applied only to Annex 1 Parties and were internationally negotiated. The other difference is the way in which the agreed targets are publicized. NDCs are recorded in a public registry maintained by UNFCCC, whereas the Kyoto Protocol’s emission targets were annexed to the agreement (Bodansky, 2016, p. 304). However, Rosencranz and Jamwal (2020) considered this bottom-up, flexible, and nonbinding mechanism “a total departure from the notion of CBDR- RC”—the notion of determining responsibility based on historical level of GHG emissions—as illustrated in the UNFCCC regime (Rosencranz & Jamwal, 2020, p. 292).
> The key element of the Paris commitment is that it provides for the prospect of increasing the ambition of commitments every 5 years. Countries must then pursue domestic measures to achieve commitments and provide necessary information for clarity and transparency. Article 5 encourages parties to conserve and enhance, as appropriate, sinks and reservoirs of GHG. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement permits the international transfer of “mitigation outcomes” by encouraging voluntary cooperation among parties and defines a framework for nonmarket approaches to sustainable development.
> Article 7 recognizes that adaptation is a global challenge faced by all and that the needs of developing countries must be taken into account in providing support. All parties should engage in adaptation, including by formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans, and they should submit and periodically update an adaptation communication describing their priorities, needs, plans, and actions.
> Article 8 provides for approaches to help vulnerable countries cope with the adverse effects of climate change. Article 4 also recognizes that peaking will take longer for developing countries. Therefore, developing countries are only required to move toward, rather than take the lead in, economywide reduction targets.

>  Evolution of the International Climate Change Policy and Processes: UNFCCC to Paris Agreement
> Articles 9 to 13 reaffirm the obligations of developed countries to support the efforts of developing countries, provide for the creation of a Green Climate Fund (GCF) as a financial mechanism of the Convention, and promote transparency and annual reporting to encourage compliance. In addition, Article 14 provides for global assessment of collective progress under the Agreement to take place in 2023 and every 5 years thereafter.
> In summary, the Paris Agreement provides a framework for financial, technical, and capacity- building support to the countries that need it. It recognizes that climate finance is needed for mitigation because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions, and it expects developed countries to take the lead in providing financial assistance to countries that are less endowed and more vulnerable.
> The Paris Agreement also establishes a technology framework to provide overarching guidance to the well-functioning technology mechanism required for improving resilience to climate change and reducing GHG emissions. It places great emphasis on climate-related capacity-building for developing countries and requests all developed countries to enhance support for capacity- building actions in developing countries. Progress is tracked through an enhanced transparency framework (ETF). Starting in 2024, countries will report transparently on actions taken. The aim is to feed through the ETF into the global assessment of collective progress toward long-term climate goals.
> The Paris Agreement’s 5-year success as of March 2021 was evident as more and more countries, regions, cities, and companies established carbon neutrality targets. Zero-carbon solutions are becoming competitive across economic sectors representing 25% of emissions. This trend is most noticeable in the power and transport sectors.

> Post Paris (2016–Now) Development: Consolidation Stage
> The first COP after the adoption of the Paris Agreement was held in Marrakech in November 2016. The pressure was to keep the “spirit of Paris” alive and unpack the Paris outcomes. The aim of COP 22 in Marrakech was to seek progress, showcase “climate champions,” and assess the financial resources required to support climate change. However, the focus in Marrakech was not just on detailed implementation issues. More than 190 countries at COP 22 issued The Marrakech Action Proclamation, affirming their commitment and political will to keep up the momentum of the Paris Agreement, as a response to (then President-elect) Donald Trump’s threat to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement. The negotiations for the development of the rules and guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement also started in Marrakech. COP 22 acknowledged the need for gender-responsive climate policies and an action plan for climate- related migration, displacement, and planned relocation.
> COP 23 was held in November 2017 in Bonn under the Presidency of Fiji, and the priority was the “pre-global stocktake” and adoption of the “Talanoa Dialogue,” which was an inclusive, participatory, and transparent process for helping countries implement and enhance their NDCs (IISD, 2017). The Talanoa Dialogue encourages the parties and civil society stakeholders to exchange ideas and experiences in achieving the common goal of limiting the rise in global

> average temperature as set out in the Paris Agreement. COP 23 continued the Paris Agreement operationalization process with the preparation of the draft “Paris rule book,” to be considered for approval at COP 24 in 2018.
> The pre-conferences for COP 24 were climate change conferences held in Bonn in April 2018 and in Bangkok in September 2018. COP 24 was held in December 2018 in Katowice, Poland. The talks in Katowice were tension-filled because parties could not agree on the rules for voluntary market mechanisms, so they were left for discussion at COP 25 in Madrid in December 2019 (CarbonBrief, 2018).
> The main task for COP 25 was to finalize Article 6 of the Paris Agreement—that is, to develop guidelines on how international carbon markets would work and also to pave the way for carbon reduction commitments at COP 26 in Glasgow in 2021. There was disagreement among parties on the strength of the rules to set up an international carbon market, and some countries objected to double counting of the carbon credits from the Kyoto Protocol. The “loss and damage” issue was another cause of disagreements among parties. Despite these disagreements, COP 25 did pave the way for further negotiations for emission reduction at COP 26 (KPMG, 2019).
> Post Paris Effectiveness and Equity
> Many studies were conducted in the lead up to the Paris negotiations and since the adoption of the Agreement. Opinions on the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement are varied and many scientists have criticized the sufficiency of the Paris targets to reach the desired global climate change outcome. However, the Brookings study Global Economic and Environmental Outcomes of the Paris Agreement (Liu et al., 2019) concluded that the climate benefits produced by the Paris Agreement have been very large, although the Agreement did not stabilize emissions, and that every region has received a net benefit from participating in the Agreement. The authors used a model to project the potential economic outcomes if countries meet their NDCs, and they estimated the global climate benefit through to 2030 in dollar terms of U.S.$2.25 trillion in present value. This was based on the social value of a metric ton of CO2 abated as U.S.$42 (Liu et al., 2019, p. 41).
> A similar outlook from the business community is that, despite the setbacks, policy disagreements, and differences between the actions required to address climate change and what governments are prepared to do, the Paris Agreement momentum is likely to continue well into this century as countries commit to reducing their carbon emission to net zero by 2050. Countries representing two-fifths of global gross domestic product, around U.S.$35 trillion in economic output, have already made that commitment, and the trend will continue due to the increasing technology-driven decarbonization of energy and transport systems (KPMG, 2019).
> The effectiveness of the Paris Agreement is demonstrated through the initiatives from various bodies, such as The Investor Agenda <https://theinvestoragenda.org/> and the Task Force. The purpose of The Investor Agenda is to provide a common leadership agenda for investors, especially institutional investors, to develop “comprehensive investor climate action plans (ICAPs) and to align their investments with the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, with

> credible interim targets, among other actions” (Investor Agenda, 2021). The Investor Agenda encourages the investor disclosure recommended by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD consists of 31 members from across the G20, representing both preparers and users of financial disclosures, and the disclosures they promote assist the markets in addressing “the financial impact of climate change by increasing transparency on climate-related risks and opportunities to promote more informed financial decision-making” (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, 2020).
> Other positive climate initiatives that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement are the climate finance initiatives, such as the Global Environmental Facility, the GCF, the Special Climate Change Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, and the Adaptation Fund (AF). These funds are aimed at supporting developing countries in accelerating their national action plan. Technology and capacity-building of developing countries to effectively address climate change has long been recognized by negotiating parties in the UNFCCC (1992), the Kyoto Protocol (1997), and most recently the Paris Agreement (2015). Biennial reports to the UNFCCC show the capacity- building support that developed countries provide to assist developing countries in implementing the frameworks on capacity-building. Another initiative to support countries in reducing emissions is available through the technical examination process that explores high-potential policies, practices, and technologies that can increase the mitigation ambition of pre-2020 climate action.
> Although the Paris Agreement can be seen to have the potential to effectively bring about long- term global commitments to address climate change, there are a number of equity issues yet to be resolved. One issue is the North–South divide, which involves post-industrial countries, mainly in the Global North, that have contributed to GHG emissions and emerging economies, mainly in the Global South, that may be constrained by a climate commitment. The concern is how to address the equity issue of past emissions versus future emissions (Ulgen, 2021).
> Another equity issue yet to be resolved is how to calculate the compensation for loss and damage arising from the increasing extreme events caused by anthropogenic GHG emissions. Article 8 of the Paris Agreement lacks clear definitions, and there are issues surrounding how to take into consideration the differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries (Boyd et al., 2021).
> Linkage Between Paris Agreement, SDGs, and Sendai Framework for DRR
> The year 2015 was a fertile year for global agreements, with the historic Paris Agreement, the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) 2015–2030, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit. Through these landmark global agreements, the international community reaffirmed an unequivocal commitment to pursuing a sustainable and climate-resilient future (LRI, 2020). While each of the three agreements was negotiated through a separate forum and therefore differs in structure,

> legal context, and implementation mechanism, they share common aspirations. The central tenets of the agreements are reducing risks associated with all hazards and unsafe conditions and ensuring sustainable and equitable economic, social, and environmental development.
> While no specific mentions of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or DRR appear in the Paris Agreement, the COP decision adopting the Paris Agreement, Decision 1/CP.21, makes an explicit reference to both the 2030 Agenda and the Sendai Framework. It indicates the fact that the Paris Agreement generally endorses the importance of DRR processes but limits its sphere to the climate change context only. However, the Paris Agreement includes many references to sustainable development as providing the context in which parties are to implement their actions, but it makes no direct connection to the SDGs. Within the SDGs, goal 13 on climate action clearly aims to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.” Similar to SDGs, the Sendai Framework acknowledges the mandate of the UNFCCC as the primary oversight body for climate change policy and also makes clear reference to the challenges posed by climate change for DRR.
> The Paris Agreement, although developed specifically in the context of climate change, generally accepts that climate change, sustainable development, and DRR are intimately intertwined (LRI, 2020). Given this interconnectedness, there are potential benefits of establishing the linkage between building resilience, disaster preparedness, and sustainable development. Therefore, future research should focus on the opportunities and challenges associated with building coherent and practical bridges across the different but overlapping policy areas.
> Conclusion
> The UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, together with a number of both binding and voluntary decisions and agreements, have influenced the international climate change regime. The UNFCCC was the first global attempt to provide an intergovernmental platform to address the effects of climate change. The Kyoto Protocol required industrialized countries to limit their emissions of GHG and to set targets and timetables by which GHG emissions would be reduced by an average of 5% below 1990 levels (Barrett, 1998, p. 20; Böhringer, 2003, p. 451). The Paris Agreement set out a global framework with the aim of substantially reducing global GHG emission to limit the global temperature increase in this century to well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5°C. Each of the three agreements aims to achieve one common goal: “to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development” (UNFCCC, 1992).
> However, a major shift in approaches and mechanisms has occurred in the process of the evolution of international climate change policies and governance since the 1990s. Shifting away from the Kyoto Protocol’s top-down approach, the Paris Agreement adopted a bottom-up and global approach through NDCs (Bodansky, 2016, p. 289). Bodansky (2016) characterized this approach as a “Goldilocks solution that is neither too strong (and hence unacceptable to key

> states) nor too weak (and hence ineffective)” (Bodansky, 2016, p. 289). However, to strengthen the operation and implementation of the principles of the Paris Agreement, international norms will complement the NDCs to ensure transparency and accountability and motivate states to reinforce their efforts (Bodansky, 2016, p. 289).
> The precursor to COP 26 in Glasgow, Scotland, was Regional Climate Weeks. The purpose of the Regional Climate Weeks was to encourage and facilitate the implementation of NDCs under the Paris Agreement. In 2021, the Regional Climate Weeks that were hosted were Africa Climate Week 2021, Asia-Pacific Climate Week 2021, and the Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2021.The Asia-Pacific regional session held in July 2021 showed a positive enthusiasm, with Japan committing toward achieving net zero by 2050 and the Asia-Pacific Region making an effort toward carbon neutrality (UN, 2021a).
> On February 26, 2021, UN Secretary-General António Guterres summed up the urgency of climate change action after the publication of the initial NDC Synthesis Report as follows:
> 2021 is a make or break year to confront the global climate emergency. The science is clear, to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, we must cut global emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels. Today’s interim report from the UNFCCC is a red alert for our planet. It shows governments are nowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The major emitters must step up with much more ambitious emissions reductions targets for 2030 in their Nationally Determined Contributions well before the November UN Climate Conference in Glasgow.
> (UN, 2021b)
> Both industrialized and developing countries made new commitments during COP 26 in November 2021. However, experts have expressed concerns that the pledges are not adequate to achieve the goal, and uncertainty surrounds the implementation of the commitments.
> The major development in international climate change policies and processes that could answer the urgent call to climate action would be through the corporate and the investment sector. Institutions like the Investor Agenda promote climate change in the areas of corporate engagement, investment, policy advocacy, and investor disclosure. The result is that many major large companies are now promoting climate change and pledging major emission reductions. The promotion of climate change through the corporate sector has also been fueled by institutional investors, who are translating climate risks to financial risks. Investors want to understand how to position themselves for this fundamental shift in finance and are demanding transparency and investor disclosure; therefore, climate risk reporting is becoming a norm. In addition, the government and judiciary in many countries are making laws and decisions that support policies with reduced climate risks. This major evolution is a welcome change because it has the potential to spread the responsibility to curb emissions to a larger number of players in the global community and to support Secretary-General Guterres’ call to address the urgency of climate action.
