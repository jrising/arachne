**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Commercial Fishing Effort – Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)” as a data gap.

> AIS data are transmitted from vessels to shore-based and/or satellite receivers and report information such as vessel name, location, speed, and direction of travel. The data can be used on board by vessel watchstanding officers for collision avoidance and by maritime authorities to track and monitor vessel movements. Global AIS data collected from both satellite and internet- connected shore-based stations are aggregated and made available on the internet through a number of service providers for a subscription fee. None of these service providers include AIS from the USCG’s Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS).

> The USCG collects real-time data on vessel identify, characteristics, movement and other valuable security, economic, and environmental parameters using a network of land-based antennas. Through an informal collaborative with the Marine Cadastre, AIS has been re-packaged and released freely to the public for ocean planning purposes since 2009. The utility and popularity of these data have grown significantly as have the requests for enhancements to the data and the data sharing process. The Committee on Marine Transportation Safety is currently evaluating this ongoing effort to see if it can be stabilized and leveraged to serve a wider community of maritime stakeholders. The active participation of the USCG and other maritime agencies is essential to the success of any future expanded efforts.
> 					
> Over the past few years, the Northeast portal has also taken a prominent role in working hands-on with stakeholders to improve AIS derived products, tools, and in the joint development of data and tools with the Marine Cadastre team. The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions develop derivative products from the Marine Cadastre data including heat maps and other derivatives indicating vessel traffic locations.
> 					
> Stakeholders who use the AIS data frequently ask for improvements to the designation of vessel type and vessel characteristics which requires cross referencing to numerous other federal and commercial data sources. No single agency or office has an existing capacity or duty to take on this type of value-added AIS product support.
> 					
> The AIS data published by the Marine Cadastre are generally 12 to 18 months old. Some projects need data for a specific time frame and/or nearer to real time data.

> Additionally, satellite AIS data are a need for some regions (i.e. Pacific Islands, Alaska) that do not have as many land antennae (or none at all such as American Samoa). The USCG has a license agreement in place for satellite AIS, but the Marine Cadastre and the regional portals cannot make these data publicly available. Alaska often gets the data from Norway. Funding for a license agreement for Alaska and the Pacific Islands would be one possible solution.
> 					
> The Arctic Domain Awareness Center is working on integrating and visualizing vessel traffic data in and around Alaska. The land-based AIS data for Alaska come via the Marine Exchange, not the USCG. The real-time data are available by subscription (and to the USCG); historic data are free but require work to make them useful. Axiom has done some work on this but their work will end in late 2018.

> According to a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018), the Vessel Traffic-Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data, which offer details regarding vessel identifications, their characteristics, movements, and other important parameters, are collected mostly by the USCG and are subsequently shared freely with the public for ocean planning purposes, thanks to a partnership with the Marine Cadastre. However, limitations in the existing system produce several data gaps. 
> 
> Key areas that could advantageously use data enhancements include offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience and climate adaptation, offshore renewable energy siting and leasing, species and habitat management, oil and gas extraction, maritime and navigation safety, permitting for other offshore infrastructure, and subsistence use. More specifically, improved data could help manage allocation conflicts between commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries, document valuable areas for vessel transit regarding renewable energy integration, and reduce conflicts from vessel traffic. 
> 
> However, despite the increasing demands for enhancements to the data, and the data-sharing process, there are significant barriers to achieving these improvements. For instance, AIS data frequently invoked include the need for better designation of vessel type and vessel characteristics, which would necessitate cross-referencing with numerous federal and commercial data sources. At present, no single agency has the existing capacity or duty to undertake this type of enhancement for AIS data products.
> 
> Furthermore, the AIS data default time-lag of 12 to 18 months creates another significant data gap, with some projects requiring more recent or real-time data.  The advanced analytical capacity of the AISAPI tool developed by the USACE exists, but is not publicly accessible, and is only provided on request to other federal agencies. 
> 
> Satellite AIS data, which could potentially remedy certain data gaps, such as providing information in regions with limited land antennae infrastructure, are also inaccessible. While USCG has a license agreement for satellite AIS, regional portals and the Marine Cadastre cannot make these data publicly available. 
> 
> These data gaps are reaffirmed by Trice et al. (2021). They suggest that strong measures by entities including the USCG, the Maritime Administration (MARAD), and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) could solidify, grow, and augment this resource for the broader maritime community. Specific suggested improvements include enhancing the identification and characteristics of vessels, increasing access frequency, building readily-useable products, and ensuring better access to satellite AIS data, where land-based receivers are lacking. 
> 
> Worth noting for the Delaware ocean and bay planning process is that both reports emphasize the need for real-time or more up-to-date AIS data, improved data on vessel characteristics, and possible enhanced use of satellite AIS data. Following these recommendations could enhance marine and coastal management efforts in Delaware, across areas such as renewable energy siting, commercial shipping lanes, fisheries management, and conservation planning.
