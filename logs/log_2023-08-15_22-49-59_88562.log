**assistant**:
> Here's how you can change the title on legends in QGIS, specifically in the Layout Manager:
> 
> 1. **Open Layout Manager**: Click on `Project` in the main menu, then select `Layouts`, and then `Layout Manager`. 
> 
> 2. **Choose Your Layout**: In the Layout Manager, choose the layout in which you want to change the legend title and click `Show`.
> 
> 3. **Select Legend**: Once the Layout is shown, click on the legend in your layout to select it. The selected legend will be highlighted.
> 
> 4. **Open Item Properties**: On the right side of the screen, you will find the `Item Properties`. Click on it to expand the options.
> 
> 5. **Change Title**: Under `Item Properties`, you will find the `Legend Items` section. Here, at the top, you can find an editable field for `Title`. Click on the existing title, and you can change it to what you want.
> 
> Remember to hit `Enter` or click away from the field after typing to ensure that changes save. Then save your layout, and your changed legend title should now appear whenever this layout is used.
