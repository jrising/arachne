> I am on an academic contract, with 75% research time paid by my University. If I spend some of that time on a grant, is this considered a cost share? Does this relate to the phrase release time?
**assistant**:
> Yes, spending your University-paid research time on a grant activity can indeed be considered a form of cost-sharing or matching commitment. If your University allows this, you take on the commitment to spend a portion of your time to a grant-funded activity without directly charging the grant. This is your University's indirect contribution to the project. 
> 
> The term "release time" often refers to the portion of your time that is proposed to be directly funded by a grant. The University "releases" you from your normal duties to work on the grant project, and the grant replaces your normal University-funded salary for that amount of time. This kind of time is typically expressed in academic months.

> However, keep in mind that many Universities have policies and restrictions about cost-sharing and release time, and you should consult with your University's grant or sponsored programs office for specific advice and guidance. Policies on cost-sharing can vary and can affect issues like indirect cost recovery or accounting practices, so it's crucial that these are fully understood before a proposal is submitted to a granting agency. Additionally, many granting agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, have their own rules or restrictions on voluntary committed cost-sharing.
