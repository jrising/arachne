**user**:
> In a report, I want to say, "Multiple sectors and channels help to explain these effects and their heterogeneity." But I'm worried "heterogeneity" will not be understood by my readers. How can I reword it?
**assistant**:
> You can replace "heterogeneity" with simpler words or phrases that convey similar meaning. For instance, you could say:
> 
> "Multiple sectors and channels help to explain these effects and their variability." 
> 
> Or if you'd like to emphasize the uniqueness of the effects, you could say:
> 
> "Multiple sectors and channels help to explain these effects and their diverse character."
> 
> Or, splitting it into two sentences could help the readability:
> 
> "Multiple sectors and channels aid in explaining these effects. Each one contributes in its unique way, leading to a range of different outcomes."
