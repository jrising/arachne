**user**:
> What's the term I'm looking for, when your econometric regression is descriptive of the world as it is actually observed, rather than as the theory might say. post-something?
**assistant**:
> The term you're probably thinking of is "post-hoc." A post-hoc analysis in econometrics refers to when the model is based on actual patterns in the data, as opposed to a theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms. A post-hoc analysis is generally considered less authoritative because it might capture incidental correlations that are not based on causality. But when the underlying mechanisms are hard to pin down, it can still provide useful insights.

> Do keep in mind the potential drawbacks; for instance, post-hoc models can be subject to overfitting or spurious correlations. As always, empirical validation and theoretical grounding should support your model whenever possible.
