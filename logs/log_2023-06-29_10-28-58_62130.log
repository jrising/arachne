> What is the difference between an  I-20 and a DS-2019 form?
**assistant**:
> Both the I-20 and DS-2019 forms are official U.S. government documents that certify eligibility for either F (academic) or J (exchange) visa statuses, respectively. 
> 
> **I-20 form:**
> 
> The Form I-20, also known as the Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status-For Academic and Language Students, is delivered by schools in the United States to prospective international students. This form is used to apply for an F-1 student visa.
> 
> The I-20 form indicates that a student has been admitted to a full-time study program at an accredited educational institution, or been accepted into a language-training program in the U.S.
> 
> **DS-2019 form:**
> 
> The Form DS-2019, or the Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, is used to apply for a J-1 exchange visitor visa. The DS-2019 is issued by program sponsors, which can be educational institutions, businesses, or other organizations.
> 
> This form is needed when someone plans to participate in an exchange program in the U.S., which includes studying, teaching, conducting research, or receiving training.
> 
> In summary, while both documents serve similar functions of proving your eligibility to study in the U.S., they are used for different types of visas and are issued by different types of institutions or sponsors.
