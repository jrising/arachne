> Estimating Current Climate Losses - Project Proposal
> PI: James Rising, University of Delaware
> 
> Context: The planet has already warmed by 1.34 Â°C [1.2 - 1.5 Â°C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. Under one expert review of global damages, this suggests that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion. In poor, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be significantly greater.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> Deliverable: This project will develop best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome will be percent reductions in GDP per capita and percent reductions in capital wealth, in 2023, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP per capita is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels. A recent estimate of GDP losses, combining three of these results and produced by the PI for a previous ECF-funded project on the cost of climate change in the UK, is shown below.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses will provide new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change. The losses would also be reported as a global average and for various regional and country groups (e.g., LLMICs, G77, Sub-Saharan Africa).
> 
> Annually varying loss estimates will underlie these results, which will reflect greater losses in years with heat waves and in later years as climate change accelerates. We will develop short case studies from the EU and LLMICs will compare these GDP losses to other reported impacts of recent heat waves.
> 
> The estimates will be produced as part of a short report made initially available to the sponsors Nov. 1, 2023, and for release during COP 28. The work will then be prepared for academic publication.
> 
> Unique contribution: To produce these results, we bring together existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate (see Table under Points of Methodology). Over the past decade, this literature has proposed many different approaches to understanding the effect of climate on GDP, including investigations of the differential vulnerability of poor countries, the role of persistent losses to growth, and the potential of adaptation. Current attempts to synthesise this literature are limited to simply averaging the results. Using a machine learning model, calibrated to the results from this literature, we will produce an estimate that reflects the most advanced features of all of these papers.

> The PI has developed a system for generating projections from this class of models for the UK climate impacts project. The machine learning approach is based on another of the PIâ€™s projects, producing a best-estimate of the social cost of carbon.

> We will use ERA5 reanalysis weather data to produce historical projections of climate effects, available 1940 - present. To construct the counterfactual without climate change, we will resample values from the baseline period (1940 - 1960). A key question in the literature is the extent to which impacts put countries on a permanently lower growth trajectory. This was carefully analysed in a previous paper of the PIâ€™s, and the resulting uncertain distribution of persistence will be used here.
> 
> Drawing upon both the headline estimates and additional results in the paper will provide evidence across the space of possible combinations of model elements. A random forest model will then be fit to these models, informed by meta-data about each. Finally, the random forest will be queried for damages from a model that simultaneously represents high-quality features in all model categories.
> 
> As an additional line of evidence, we will use the previously mentioned Howard & Sterner meta-analysis of damage results derived from expert elicitation. This provides both a measure of catastrophic risk, which will be applied uniformly across the globe, and an estimate of non-catastrophic global losses, which can be used as a loose constraint on the sum of the machine learning results.

> Please include the following points:
> 
> Part 1: Impacts in 2022
>  - Global population-weighted GDP loss in 2022 is 6.4% [IQR 2.4 - 8.5%], accounting for direct, international, and capital losses. As a percentage of global GDP, however, that is a loss of 0.6% [3.6% loss to 1.9% gain]. This is because of the significant benefits experienced by many richer countries.
>  - Losses are considerable across the Global South, with double-digit losses in many areas of the tropics and averaging 10% across Africa in 2022 (Fig. #FPMAP). Southern Africa shows the largest regional losses at 17% of GDP (Fig. #FPECO).
>  - In contrast, much of Europe and northern Asia shows benefits from climate change (5% for Europe and 7% for Central Asia, Fig. #FPREG), driven by reduced winter chill.
>  - The United States shows a benefit of 2% of GDP, while China shows no change (Fig. #FPMAP).
>  -  This exacerbates global inequality. Averaged across the developed world or OECD, there are almost no current aggregate losses from climate change [IQR 3% loss to 5% gain]. In contrast, low income countries show an average 11% loss of GDP [6 - 15%].
>  - In terms of total dollars (constant 2015 USD), GDP in high-income countries has increased an estimated $287 billion due to climate change, while the rest of the world has lost $1217 billion (see #LEVELCHANGE).
>  - The majority of these losses are direct impacts from local temperature. International impacts increase losses by approximately 1 pp for each country outside of Europe and North America. Capital effects increase losses by 1 - 2 pp in most regions.
>  - Figure #FPGRP shows these results by UNFCCC party groupings. Most coalitions represent average losses in 2022 of around 10% of the GDP of the member countries. For example, the G-77 has an average loss of 6% of GDP [1 - 10%]. The Small Island Developing States (SIDS) under AOSIS have a loss of 9% [4 - 11%], and this is likely a significant underestimate since sea-level rise is not accounted for. The EU, on the other hand, has average gains of 2% [2% loss to 5% gain].
> 
> Part 2: Evolution of impacts
>  - Globally GDP losses have tracked temperatures. Since 1960, temperatures have risen nearly linearly by about 1 Â°C as population-weighted GDP has fallen 6.4% (see Figure #GLOBALTIME).
>  - Outcomes for individual countries vary widely, and individual years can be quite different (Figure #COUNTRYTIME). GDP in Russia has increased by 13% [10 - 17%] due to climate change, while GDP in Saudi Arabia has fallen by 13% [3 - 19%]. These results assume that fossil fuel extraction is unaffected by temperatures.
>  - The US and China have had similar experiences, and are both currently near the break-even point, with neither losses from high temperatures nor gains from milder winters.
> 
> Part 3: Capital losses
>  - Losses to GDP also cause capital investments to fall, which eventually drives down the stock of produced capital in a country.
>  - Here, we also see significant heterogeneity. High income countries have an estimated $549 billion less in produced capital than they would have without climate impacts, while the rest of the world has $2033 billion less (see #LEVELCHANGE).
>  - The effect on renewable capital is more muted because of two effects pushing in opposite directions. We model temperature as having a direct (generally negative) effect on the ability of the natural world to generate ecosystem services. At the same time, reductions in GDP also reduce the strain placed upon the natural world, allowing capital to grow. On net, these effects result in a loss of $339 billion in rich countries and $583 billion in the rest of the world, with a notable increase of $134 billion in renewable capital in low income countries.
>  - We do not model changes in human capital (education) or nonrenewable capital due to climate change.

> # 4. Results and Findings
> 
> ## 4.1 Country-specific results
> 
> Globally, in 2022 climate change led to a reduction of 6.4% in population-weighted GDP [IQR 2.4 - 8.5%], accounting for direct, international, and capital losses. However, this translates to a loss of only 0.6% of global GDP, as many developed countries experienced benefits from climate change that offset losses in less developed countries. See Figure #FPMAP for a detailed geographical breakdown.
> 
> The highest losses were experienced by countries in the Global South. Africa as a whole saw an average GDP loss of 10% for 2022, with Southern Africa experiencing the most significant reductions at 17%.
> 
> Europe and Central Asia actually saw GDP increases (5% and 7%, respectively) as a result of reduced winter chill. Similarly, the United States experienced a 2% GDP boost. China's GDP remained relatively unaffected.
> 
> These contrasting impacts have created a global inequality with developed or OECD countries experiencing almost no current aggregate losses from climate change [IQR 3% loss to 5% gain]. On the other hand, low-income countries showed an average 11% loss of GDP [6 - 15%].
> 
> Annual GDP in high-income countries increased by an estimated $287 billion due to climate change, while the rest of the world suffered a loss of $1217 billion20015 USD. Most losses were due to direct impacts of local temperature, but international impacts and capital effects enriched the losses further (Figure #FPMAP).
> 
> ## 4.2 Capital Losses
> 
> GDP losses also led to reduced capital investment, resulting in lower stocks of produced capital. High-income countries have an estimated $549 billion less in produced capital due to climate impacts. For other countries, the loss is estimated at $2033 billion. 
> 
> The effect on renewable capital is complex. While temperatures have a negative effect on ecosystems services, reductions in GDP reduce strain and promote capital growth. This resulted in an overall loss of $339 billion in developed countries, but an increase of $134 billion in low-income countries (Figure #LEVELCHANGE).
> 
> ## 4.3 Economic group and regional results
> 
> Most coalitions represent average losses in 2022 of around 10% of the GDP of the member countries. For example, the G-77 experienced an average loss of 6% of GDP [1 - 10%]. The Small Island Developing States (SIDS) under AOSIS suffered a loss of 9% of GDP [4 - 11%], while EU countries experienced an average gain of 2% of GDP [2% loss to 5% gain] (Figure #FPGRP).
> 
> ## 4.4 Voting blocs at the UNFCCC COP meetings
> 
> The losses experienced by countries and blocs significantly influence how they approach climate negotiations. See Figure #FPGRP to understand how UNFCCC party groupings are impacted.
> 
> Over time, individual impacts in countries vary greatly, with region-specific climate effects causing stark differences in estimated GDP. For example, Russia experienced a 13% increase in GDP due to climate change, while Saudi Arabia had its GDP reduced by 13% [3 - 19%]. Both the US and China are at a near-break-even point, experiencing neither losses from high temperatures nor gains from milder winters (Figure #COUNTRYTIME).
> 
> These disparities indeed represent an increase in inequalities between countries, which needs to be considered in future environmental and economic policies.
