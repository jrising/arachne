**user**:
> My linux machine has an external HD. How can I find it and mount it?
**assistant**:
> To find and mount an external hard drive on a Linux machine, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Find the External Hard Drive:**
> 
>    You can use the `lsblk` or `fdisk` command to list all block devices, which includes hard drives. Here's how to use `lsblk` and `fdisk`:
> 
>    * `lsblk`: This command lists all block devices (hard drives, flash drives, etc.) 
>      ```
>      lsblk
>      ```
>      Your external hard drive should appear in this list.
> 
>    * `fdisk`: This command provides more detailed information.
>      ```
>      sudo fdisk -l
>      ```
>      Look for your hard drive in the output.
> 
> 2. **Mount the External Hard Drive:**
> 
>    Once you've identified the device name (something like `/dev/sdb1`), you can mount it. First, create a mount point. This is a directory where the filesystem on your external hard drive will be mounted.
>    ```
>    sudo mkdir /media/external_hd
>    ```
> 
>    Now mount the external hard drive to this directory:
>    ```
>    sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/external_hd
>    ```
> 
>    Replace `/dev/sdb1` with the device name of your hard drive, and `/media/external_hd` with the mount point you want to use.
> 
> 3. **Check the Mounting Result:**
> 
>    To verify that the system mounted the hard drive correctly, use the `df` command:
>    ```
>    df -h
>    ```
>    This command lists all mounted filesystems. Your external hard drive should appear in this list.
> 
> Always remember to safely unmount the external hard drive when you're done using it to prevent data loss. Here's how to unmount:
> ```
> sudo umount /media/external_hd
> ```
> 
> Also note that this mounting is temporary and does not persist after a system reboot. If you want to mount this device automatically when the system boots up, you'll need to add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file. I can guide you through this process if you're interested.
> 
> Keep in mind that the commands and paths may vary depending on the specific distribution of Linux you are using.
**user**:
> I see the drive at `/mnt/423808E91650DDB1` (I can ls the files already in that directory). Can I mount it from there? Where this is going is I would like to mount it automatically on every startup, and I don't want to have it at a random hex code, since I want to symlink into it.
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can mount the drive from the `/mnt/423808E91650DDB1` directory. To mount it automatically on every startup and have a consistent mount point, you can update the `/etc/fstab` file.
> 
> Follow the steps below to mount the drive automatically and specify a custom mount point:
> 
> 1. Open the `/etc/fstab` file in a text editor using superuser privileges. For example, using the `vi` editor:
>    ```
>    sudo vi /etc/fstab
>    ```
> 
> 2. Add a new entry at the end of the `/etc/fstab` file with the following format:
>    ```
>    UUID=<drive_UUID>   /desired/mount/point   <file_system_type>   <mount_options>   0   0
>    ```
> 
>    Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:
>    - `<drive_UUID>`: The UUID of your external hard drive. You can find it using the command: `sudo blkid /dev/sdX1` (replace `/dev/sdX1` with the appropriate device name).
>    - `/desired/mount/point`: The directory where you want to mount the drive. For example, `/mnt/my_external_hd`.
>    - `<file_system_type>`: The file system type of the drive. For most external hard drives, it is typically `ntfs` or `ext4`.
>    - `<mount_options>`: The mount options for the drive. You can use defaults like `defaults` or specify specific options like `rw,user`.
> 
>    For example:
>    ```
>    UUID=423808E91650DDB1   /mnt/my_external_hd   ext4   defaults   0   0
>    ```
> 
> 3. Save the changes and exit the editor.
> 
> 4. To mount the drive immediately based on the updated `fstab` file, run the following command:
>    ```
>    sudo mount -a
>    ```
> 
> 5. Verify that the drive is mounted correctly by checking the output of the `df` command:
>    ```
>    df -h
>    ```
> 
> The external hard drive should now be mounted automatically at your specified mount point (`/mnt/my_external_hd` in this example) every time the system starts up.
> 
> You can then create a symlink to the mounted external hard drive using the `ln -s` command. For example:
> ```
> ln -s /mnt/my_external_hd /path/to/symlink
> ```
> Replace `/path/to/symlink` with the desired location where you want the symlink to be created.
> 
> Remember to always safely unmount the drive using `umount` before disconnecting it physically to avoid data corruption.
> 
> Let me know if you need further assistance!
