> Dear committee members,
> 
> Hi!~ Really hope that you all have had a warm and productive holiday season so far!!
> 
> I haven't checked in lately with most of you, in short because I haven't had much to show, and didn't want to waste your time with only marginally-improved proposal drafts. My semester was kind of derailed, to be honest with all of you. 
> 
> Earlier this year, I discovered a personal health issue that has quickly grown (this Fall) to be a little bit debilitating in its 'peripheral' effects -- especially on my relationships, and especially on family relationships. I've been quite preoccupied with it all, but also honestly quite depressed about it, and I haven't been able to sleep (despite needing more sleep than ever due to this issue). However, with effort and a LOT of luck, this issue will be more or less 'sorted out' over the course of my dissertation. And in the meantime, thankfully my family relationship is getting more settled now, and I'm adjusting to the situation well enough that I can resume normal work (and hopefully more consistent communication). Hopefully this means better sleep will be coming along next :)
> 
> Having said all of that, could I please ask if you all have any feedback, comments, or suggestions for improvement on the attached proposal version? 
> 
> Based on my discussions with Dr. Hu, this should be the penultimate version. Dr. Hu has said that he expects this version here, or perhaps one more revision round, to be sufficient for proposal defense -- pending comments from the committee of course. So given the late date, I'm hoping to 'streamline' this process a little bit and integrate comments from the broader committee into this next (and hopefully final) revision directly. And of course if you all are still willing and able to serve on the committee, I would be extremely grateful!
> 
> Thank you all very, very much for the time and consideration. And for what it's worth, I can and will do better in terms of professional engagement :)
> 
> Happy Holidays!!!

> Hi Stevie,
> 
> One fairly glaring omission is that you appear to be planning a policy tool that is meant to support justice but which does not itself follow justice practices. 
> 
> When you discuss your new framework, you suggest that it would just have one objective function with embeded weighting, while generally multiple stakeholder perspectives will imply a multi-objective approach.
