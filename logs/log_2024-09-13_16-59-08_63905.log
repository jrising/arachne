> Hi Dr. Rising,
> 
> Hope this email finds you well. This is Md Abedur Rahman. I am reaching out to know if you are taking new graduate students for Fall 2025. I  recently finished my master's in agriculture and resource economics at the University of Delaware in the summer of 2024. I am particularly interested in climate change and its impact on the environment and natural resources research, which coincides with your research area and expertise. 
> 
> I was always impressed by your research work and interested in working with you. Last year I reached out to you and later came to know that the department wouldn't take any students for Fall 2024. So, I didn't apply. 
> 
> This year, I am again considering applying for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program at the University of Delaware. I am hereby sharing with you my academic records and attaching my resume for your reference. Can you kindly suggest if my profile is competitive enough to apply to the Environmental Economics program and if I could be considered if you are looking for a new student?

> Dear Md Abedur Rahman,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your interest in the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program at the University of Delaware. Given your strong academic background, particularly your previous work on climate change and food waste policy—an area closely aligned with my own research—I think you would be a good candidate for the program.
