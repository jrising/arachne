> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters. One activity is military operations, and there are two large military operating areas that overlap Delaware's planning region: the VACAPES OPAREA near shore, and the Atlantic City OPAREA further out. Here is a description of these areas in general:
> An Operating Area (OPAREA) in where national defense training exercises and system qualification tests are routinely conducted. OPAREA boundaries are formally established by national designation and by international treaty for national defense training purposes. OPAREAs allow for specific exercises and training events to be coordinated with other federal, state, and local agencies, and also the general public using the Local Notice to Mariners.
> 
> There is also a ship shock trial area south of the Delaware planning zone. Interestingly, this area was shifted further out-to-sea:
> In response to a comment received by National Marine Fisheries Service during the public comment
> period for the Marine Mammal Protection Act Proposed Rule the Navy assessed and agreed to move the
> Ship Shock Trial Area located in the VACAPES OPAREA away from the Mid-Atlantic Planning Awareness
> Area (PAA) and to include a 5 NM buffer between the Mid-Atlantic PAA and the Ship Shock Trial Area.
> 
> Please write a paragraph of the military use of the Delaware planning area for the report.

> The military use of the Delaware planning area primarily falls within two significant sections: the VACAPES OPAREA, close to the shoreline, and the Atlantic City OPAREA, situated further out to sea. These Operating Areas (OPAREAs) are official zones in which national defense exercises and system qualification tests are conducted routinely, with boundaries sanctioned both nationally and internationally. These areas provide a secure environment for the coordination of defense activities involving federal, state, and local agencies while also ensuring the general public's welfare through mechanisms such as the Local Notice to Mariners. Adjacent to this, a notable area devoted to ship shock trials lies south of Delaware's planning zone. Interestingly, this area was recently shifted further out to sea to ensure a 5 NM buffer from the Mid-Atlantic Planning Awareness Area (PAA) as part of a commitment to minimize potential impacts on marine wildlife following a consultation period governed by the National Marine Fisheries Service under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
