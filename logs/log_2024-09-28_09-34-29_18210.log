> I remember a song from the 2000's about war by an artist -- Monte somthing maybe? There's a line in there like "what do we know, we're only 17". What was it?
**assistant**:
> The song you're thinking of is likely "Teenagers" by Mondo Rock. However, Mondo Rock is an Australian rock band, and the song “Teenagers” comes from the early 80s. The lyric "What do we know, we're only seventeen" fits well with your memory. If that's not the one you meant, could you provide any more details about the song or artist?
**user**:
> Is there another? I think the musicians were usually thought of as a comedy group.
**assistant**:
> You might be thinking of "19" by Paul Hardcastle, but it sounds like what you're really after is "The Bad Touch" by The Bloodhound Gang. They were often categorized as a novelty or comedy group, and they have a playful style that aligns with your description. The line "What do we know, we're only 17" is reminiscent of their work. If that doesn’t sound right, let me know if you have any more details!
**user**:
> Can you think of any bands from the 90s - 00s with Monte in their name?
**assistant**:
> Yes! You might be thinking of "Monte" from the band **Monte Pittman**, who is known for his work in rock and metal, but that doesn't quite fit your comedy group description. Another possibility could be **Mondo Cane**, but they aren't primarily known for comedy either.

> If you were looking for something more comedic, **The Monte Carlos** could have come up, though they were more obscure. If you can recall more specifics about the music or style, I can help narrow it down further!
