**user**:
> I have a photo where the background is a bit yellow but I want it to be pretty close to white. How can I edit it to be whiter in Gimp without it being perfect white?
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can guide you through the process of making the yellowish background of your photo closer to white using GIMP. Here's a simple method using the "Colors > Levels" tool:
> 
> 1. Open your image in GIMP.
> 2. Click on `Colors` in the top menu, and then click on `Levels`.
> 3. In the Levels window, you will see a histogram representing the current color levels in your image. 
>    Below the histogram, there are three eyedropper tools for picking black, gray, and white points, respectively.
> 4. Click on the right-most eyedropper tool (for picking the white point).
> 5. Now, click on a part of the image that you'd *like* to be white. Don't choose the most yellow area, because we don't want complete white, but an area that is more yellow than you'd like.
> 6. GIMP will correct the color levels based on the point you selected. Your image's yellowish tone should now be closer to white—but not a pure white—since you didn't click on the most yellow area.
> 7. If you're not happy with the first attempt, you can keep trying until you get the color balance you want. Every time you click, it will adjust based on the *current* image, so if things get too far off, cancel and restart the process.
> 
> Before you implement these changes, remember to save a copy of the original image file. This method is non-destructive, but it's always a good idea to keep the original image for future reference.
**user**:
> This seems to set certain pixels completely white. I want it to be more partially washed out with white. How do I do that?
**assistant**:
> If you want a more subtle effect where the yellow background is washed out with white rather than being set to a pure white, you can use a different approach in GIMP. One way to achieve this is to use the "Colors > Curves" tool:
> 
> 1. Open your image in GIMP.
> 2. Click on `Colors` in the top menu, and then click on `Curves`.
> 3. In the Curves window, you will see a diagonal line representing the current tonal range of the image. The bottom left represents shadows, and the top right represents highlights.
> 4. To wash out the yellow background with white, you can create a gentle S-curve by adding a point in the middle of the line and lifting it slightly.
> 5. Click on the line to add points to manipulate the curve. Add a point in the middle and lift it slightly to brighten the midtones and highlights.
> 6. Adjust the curve until you achieve the desired washed-out effect on the yellow background. Be careful not to overdo it, as it can affect other parts of the image as well.
> 7. You can preview the changes in real-time by checking the "Preview" box in the Curves window.
> 
> Using the Curves tool gives you more control over the tonal adjustments in your image, allowing you to create a softer, washed-out effect rather than a stark white background. Remember to save your work as a new file to preserve the original image.
