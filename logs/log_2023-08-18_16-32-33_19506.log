> There is no aquaculture in the planning area. I have generated a map which shows the planning area with aquaculture operations in the bay north of the planning area (in New Jersey waters), and Shellfish Aquaculture Development Areas (SADA) in the inland bay area. Here are descriptions of these datasets:

> Aquaculture Operations:
> These data show the location of aquaculture operations within coastal and offshore waters of the United States. Aquaculture types may include aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic plants. The presence and location of aquaculture operations were derived from multiple state websites and include only those in coastal and marine saltwater areas. The states of Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana, and Mississippi are not included in this data set, but are available individually in the Data Registry.
> SADA:
> Leases are available for lands within defined Shellfish Aquaculture Development Areas (SADA), which have expedited state and federal permitting processes, and outside of these areas.
> 
> These come from a document titled 3800 Shellfish Aquaculture, which starts with the following introduction:
> These regulations provide for a shellfish aquaculture industry in Delaware's Inland Bays that is compatible with commercial and recreational finfishing and shellfishing, boating navigation and public safety, public water access and use, and native biota. Specifically, the regulations provide a structured process and set conditions for leasing of subaqueous bottom within Delaware's Inland Bays for the culture of bivalve shellfish. The regulations include requirements for lease: application, locations, issuance, marking, renewal, transfer, expiration, termination, condemnation and emergency relocation. The regulations further propose measures related to: shellfish aquaculture gear and marking, shellfish nursery permitting and structures, harvester license qualifications, bivalve species authorized for aquaculture, activities within subaqueous lease areas, and shellfish aquaculture reporting requirements.

> Please write a paragraph describing aquaculture operations around the marine planning area, and noting the potential for expansion of these into the area.

> The marine planning area currently under consideration does not contain active aquaculture operations at this time. However, it's worth noting the existence of aquaculture operations in the nearby bay, located north of the planning area, specifically within New Jersey waters. This sector encompasses a variety of aquatic organisms including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic plants. The data provided on these operations is thorough, but unfortunately excludes certain states, namely Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana, and Mississippi. In addition, there are identified Shellfish Aquaculture Development Areas (SADA) demarcated within the inland bay vicinity. These areas are earmarked due to their expedited state and federal permitting processes, that potentially makes them conducive to and expedient for future aquaculture expansion. Mandated regulations ensure that any shellfish aquaculture industry within Delaware's Inland Bays harmonizes with commercial and recreational fishing, boating, public safety, and the conservation of local biota. Provided processes, conditions, and requirements are met, this could potentially allow for the transition of aquaculture operations into the marine planning area in the future, thus contributing to the diversification and expansion of the local fishing industry.
