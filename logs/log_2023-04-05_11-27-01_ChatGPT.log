> The term commonly used for when developers get together to work on projects for a day is "hackathon." A hackathon is an event in which developers, designers, and other technical professionals collaborate intensively on software projects, typically for a short period of time, often 24-48 hours. The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software or hardware projects, with a focus on innovation and experimentation. Hackathons often include prizes, mentoring, and other incentives to encourage participation and creative problem-solving.
