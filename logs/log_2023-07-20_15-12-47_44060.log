> How else might I say that impacts on one sector have indirect effects on other sectors, and so on throughout the economy? I generally think of this as those impacts "trickling down" on other sectors, but this has other connotations.

> You can use several alternative expressions to convey the idea of indirect effects spreading throughout an economy. Relating to your need to avoid the phrase "trickling down," due to its specific economic connotation, here are a few suggestions:
> 
> 1. **Ripple effect**: This term, deriving from the visual metaphor of a pebble dropped in a pond, conveys the idea of impacts spreading outwards from a central point in ever-widening circles. 
> 
>     _"Impacts on one sector create a ripple effect in other sectors, further proliferating throughout the economy."_
>    
> 2. **Domino effect**: A metaphor borrowed from physics, it conveys a chain of similar events caused by one event, just like when a line of dominoes falls.
> 
>     _"The impacts on one sector can trigger a domino effect, where repercussions are felt throughout the entire economy."_
> 
> 3. **Knock-on effect**: A term often used in British English to denote the indirect consequences or side effects resulting from an event or action.
> 
>     _"When one sector experiences an impact, it produces knock-on effects that are felt throughout the economy."_
> 
> 4. **Cascading effect**: It pertains to the idea of something, whether it be consequences or benefits, flowing down or advancing progressively like a cascade.
> 
>     _"Impacts on one sector can create a cascading effect, indirectly altering other sectors and permeating the entirety of the economy."_ 
> 
> 5. **Spillover effect**: This is an economic event in one context that occurs because of something else in a seemingly unrelated context.
> 
>     _"Impacts on one sector can result in spillover effects, indirectly influencing other sectors across the economy."_
>    
> By phrasing it differently, you could avoid misleading connotations while preserving your message's meaning and impact.
