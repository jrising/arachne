> "Data Discovery" is a term used to describe the process by which businesses collect data from various sources and apply real-time analytics to derive actionable insights. There are a few key components to data discovery:
> 
> **Data Sourcing:** This involves identifying potential data sources, both internal (your own databases, spreadsheets, etc.) and external (public databases, purchased data, social media data, etc.).
> 
> **Data Profiling:** This is the examination of the data available from a source to understand its structure, meaning, and potential usefulness in a particular context.
> 
> **Data Ingestion:** This entails gathering the data and bringing it into a form that can be directly used or stored for later use.
> 
> **Data Cleaning:** The process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset.
> 
> **Data Analysis:** Using statistical and data mining techniques to identify patterns, correlations, anomalies, and other insights.
> 
> **Data Visualization:** The graphical representation of data. It is used to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means.
> 
> In a class context, this likely means that students will learn how to locate and identify useful data, develop and use tools for analyzing the data, and present the results in a clear and compelling manner. The skills developed in such a course could be applied in a wide range of fields including business, research, policy making, and more.
