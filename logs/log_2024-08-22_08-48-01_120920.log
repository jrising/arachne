> I wanted to share an idea that Sarah Beth and I had yesterday during a brainstorming session. We thought it might be fun to do an activity at the staff retreat where we create some custom swag and think about what IMT means. We could have canvas bags pre printed with the IMT logo and then the prompt for staff to fill in: "Ask me about_____" they would write/paint it on the bags and then be able to walk around the community as visually recognizable IMT ambassadors. These bags could also be something we give/sell at the hubs.

> This may be a fun way to get some name and programmatic exposure and allow staff to sport custom swag. 
> Here is a mockup to help you see what we discussed.

**assistant**:
> ## IMT Custom Swag Creation Activity
> 
> **Purpose:**
> 
> The purpose of this activity is to create a meaningful and fun session for staff during the retreat, and enhance IMT's visibility and recognition within the community. 
> 
> **Outcome:**
> 
> At the end of the session, each staff member should have a customised canvas bag that symbolises their connection with IMT and their individual roles. This will also boost IMT's identity and possibly create a new avenue for merchandise in the hubs.
> 
> **Details and Steps:**
> 
> **1. Brainstorming:** The activity starts with brainstorming. Ensure that the staff remembers the mission, vision and goals of IMT. They have to think about their roles and how they contribute to the overall objectives of IMT, individually and as a team.
> 
> **2. On-the-spot Designing:** Preprint IMT logo on the canvas bags, after which the staff will be given prompts to fill in the sentence "Ask me about_____". They can write or paint their response on the bag. Guide them to choose topics related to IMT and their specific roles, something they are passionate about and want others to ask discuss.
> 
> **3. Review:** Allow time for participants to share their custom designs and the meaning behind what they chose to write. This allows for interesting discussions and better understanding among staff.
> 
> **4. Exhibition:** Use these bags as a walking billboard of IMT. Staff can use the bags in their daily routines, becoming visually recognisable IMT ambassadors. 
> 
> **5. Hub Merchandise:** If these bags catch interest within the community, consider making them standard swag merchandise in the hubs.
> 
> **Mockup Example:** (Include image)
> 
> In performing this activity, staff will not only engage in a creative and fun activity but will also become a part of IMT's wider promotional effort. This could be a unique method for at-once team-building, personal branding, and wider programmatic exposure. 
> 
> This activity is a perfect blend of fun, creativity, and resourceful promotion, potentially creating a closer bond among staff and enhancing IMT's visibility within the community.
