**user**:
> I'm finishing a hand written addendum to my Christmas letter for someone who loves puzzles and puns, writing "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and ...", and I want to end with an anagram of a pun. Do you have suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James. How about using this fun anagram pun to end the addendum: "Preventing you extra pun: â€˜Puns are Nap Rugs'." 
> 
> This is a clever rearrangement of the phrase "Puns are Graspin'". It's a whimsical way of saying that puns grip our attention and make us think a bit more deeply about language, very much like a good puzzle does. Hence, the pun serves as a "nap rug" for the mind, inviting you to sit and unravel it, just like you would with a puzzle!
> 
> So in your context, your sentence would be: "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and... presenting you this extra pun: 'Puns are Nap Rugs'."
> 
> I hope they enjoy the clever phrase flip!
