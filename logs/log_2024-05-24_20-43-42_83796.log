> Can you give me a block of HTML that I can use as a template, containing in succession:
>  - A link (shown not as the full URL but something short-- an icon, e.g. or the word "Link")
>  - A thumbs-up or other up-vote symbol
>  - A thumbs-down or other down-vote symbol
> 
> If they provide anything useful, I have jquery-ui and flowbite both in my page.
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Below is an HTML template that includes a link represented by an icon, along with thumbs-up and thumbs-down symbols for voting. The template leverages FontAwesome for the icons and includes jQuery to handle click events if needed. Since you have jQuery UI and Flowbite at your disposal, I ensured the elements are styled to integrate smoothly with these libraries.

> ### Template Features:
> - **Link**: A FontAwesome icon (`fas fa-external-link-alt`) that represents a link. You can change the URL in the `<a>` tag as needed.
> - **Voting**: FontAwesome icons for thumbs-up (`fas fa-thumbs-up`) and thumbs-down (`fas fa-thumbs-down`), with jQuery click event handlers to provide feedback.
> - **jQuery UI Effects**: Adding a bounce effect for up-vote and a shake effect for down-vote for visual feedback.
> - **Flowbite**: Integrated to enhance default styles if needed.
> 
> Feel free to tweak the styles or behavior to better match your specific needs!

**user**:
> I'm going to be loading these into the page as I go. Can you set up the javascript so that it makes new blocks have the shacking-- and an AJAX call to a url "/up-vote?link-id=DATA", where DATA is from a data attribute-- as these get loaded into the page?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! To dynamically add the shaking effect to new blocks as they are loaded into the page, and to make an AJAX call to "/up-vote?link-id=DATA" with the link ID taken from a data attribute, you can follow the modified JavaScript code below:
> 
> ```javascript
> $(document).ready(function(){
>     // Function to apply the shake effect to newly added vote icons
>     function applyShakeEffect() {
>         $('.vote-icons.clickable').last().effect('shake', {distance: 5}, 300);
>     }
> 
>     // Function to handle up-vote and make AJAX call
>     function handleUpVote(linkId) {
>         $.ajax({
>             url: '/up-vote?link-id=' + linkId,
>             method: 'GET',
>             success: function(response) {
>                 // Handle successful up-vote
>                 console.log('Up-vote successful for link ID:', linkId);
>             },
>             error: function(xhr, status, error) {
>                 // Handle errors
>                 console.error('Error occurred:', error);
>             }
>         });
>     }
> 
>     // Event delegation for dynamically added elements
>     $('body').on('click', '.vote-icons.clickable', function() {
>         $(this).effect('shake', {distance: 5}, 300);
>         var linkId = $(this).closest('.vote-icons').data('link-id');
>         handleUpVote(linkId);
>     });
> 
>     // Example of dynamically adding a new block with vote icons
>     var newBlock = '<span class="vote-icons clickable" data-link-id="123"><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i></span>';
>     $('.link-vote-section').append(newBlock);
> 
>     // Apply shake effect to the newly added vote icon
>     applyShakeEffect();
> });
> ```
> 
> In this code:
> - The `applyShakeEffect()` function is created to apply the shake effect to the newly added vote icons.
> - The `handleUpVote(linkId)` function is responsible for making the AJAX call to "/up-vote?link-id=DATA" with the appropriate link ID.
> - Event delegation is set up to handle click events for dynamically added elements with the class `vote-icons.clickable`.
> - An example of dynamically adding a new block with a vote icon and data attribute `data-link-id="123"` is provided, followed by applying the shake effect to the newly added vote icon. 
> 
> You can modify and integrate this JavaScript code according to your page's structure and the specific requirements of dynamically adding new blocks and handling up-votes with AJAX calls.
**user**:
> Why do we need both the applyShakeEffect and the effect-shake in the body.on(click)?
**assistant**:
> The reason for having both the `applyShakeEffect()` function and the `effect('shake')` within the `$('body').on('click', ...)` event handler is to ensure that the shake effect is not only applied to newly added vote icons dynamically but also triggered when the vote icons are clicked.
> 
> Here's why both are necessary:
> 1. **`applyShakeEffect()` function**:
>     - This function is defined to apply the shake effect specifically to newly added vote icons. It is called after dynamically adding a new block with a vote icon to ensure that the shake effect is immediately applied to the newly added element.
>     - By separating the shake effect application into a function, it allows for consistent application of styling behavior to newly added elements.
> 
> 2. **`effect('shake') within $('body').on('click', ...)`**:
>     - This part is inside the event handler and triggers the shake effect whenever a vote icon is clicked. It ensures that when a user interacts with a vote icon, they receive visual feedback in the form of the shake effect.
>     - By having this within the click event handler, it guarantees that the shake effect is applied in response to user interactions.
> 
> In summary, separating the shake effect application for newly added elements into a function (`applyShakeEffect()`) ensures consistent styling behavior when elements are dynamically added. On the other hand, having the `effect('shake')` within the click event handler ensures that the shake effect is triggered when the user interacts with the vote icons. This division of responsibilities helps maintain clear and organized code while providing the intended visual feedback for both dynamic additions and user actions.
