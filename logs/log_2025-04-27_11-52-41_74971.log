> How can I take the mean of a vector with both Missing and NaN values in Julia?
**assistant**:
> In Julia, you can use the `Statistics.mean` function to calculate the mean of a vector, while handling both `Missing` and `NaN` values by leveraging the `skipmissing` function to ignore them. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```julia
> using Statistics
> 
> vector = [1.0, 2.0, NaN, 4.0, missing, 5.0]
> 
> # Calculate the mean, ignoring Missing and NaN values
> mean_value = mean(skipmissing(filter(!isnan, vector)))
> 
> println(mean_value)
> ```
> 
> In this example, `filter(!isnan, vector)` is used to remove `NaN` values from the vector, and `skipmissing` wraps the result to handle `Missing` values. The `mean` function then computes the mean of the remaining elements. Make sure you have the `Statistics` package imported to use the `mean` function.
**user**:
> I get the error `ERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Missing) used in boolean context`, I think because isnan fails.
**assistant**:
> You're correct that using `isnan` on a vector containing `Missing` values will cause a `TypeError`. To handle both `Missing` and `NaN` values, you need to filter out those values more carefully. Here's a method that checks the type of each element and ignores both `Missing` and `NaN`:
> 
> ```julia
> using Statistics
> 
> vector = [1.0, 2.0, NaN, 4.0, missing, 5.0]
> 
> # Create a filtered vector excluding Missing and NaN
> filtered_vector = filter(x -> !ismissing(x) && !isnan(x), vector)
> 
> # Calculate the mean
> mean_value = mean(filtered_vector)
> 
> println(mean_value)
> ```

> In this version, the `filter` function includes a condition that checks if the value is neither `Missing` nor `NaN`, allowing you to compute the mean without encountering type errors.
