**user**:
> How can I combine attributes from two different shapefiles in QGIS? They have the same polygons (a grid) but different attributes.
**assistant**:
> To combine attributes from two different shapefiles in QGIS, you can use the "Join Attributes by Location" tool. This is the process:
> 
> 1. Load both shapefiles in QGIS.
> 
> 2. Go to `Vector` > `Data Management Tools` > `Join Attributes By Location`.
> 
> 3. The `Join Attributes by Location` dialog box will appear.
> 
> 4. In the `Input layer` field, select the shapefile that you want to add the attributes to.
> 
> 5. In the `Join layer` field, select the shapefile that has the attributes that you want to join.
> 
> 6. In the `Geometric predicate(s)` field, select `intersects` (or other options depending on your data). As your polygons are the same, 'intersects' is the appropriate option.
> 
> 7. Check `Take attributes of the matching feature` in the `Fields and Values` section if you want to take all attributes. Specify your preferences if you only want certain fields.
> 
> 8. In the `Joined table` prefix, you can specify a prefix that will be added to the field of the Joined Layer to differentiate them from the fields of the Input Layer.
> 
> 9. Click `Run`. The resulting shapefile will have the combined attributes of the two shapefiles.
> 
> Please check that the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) of both shapefiles are the same to avoid any mismatch or other issues. If they are different, you may need to perform a reprojection before the join.
