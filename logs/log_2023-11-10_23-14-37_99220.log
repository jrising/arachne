**assistant**:
> The data you've shared from NOAA's buoy is a collection of weather and maritime conditions. Here's a breakdown of what each column label means:
> 
> - `ID`: Identification code of the buoy.
> - `T1 TIME (GMT)`: Time of the observation in Greenwich Mean Time.
> - `LAT`: Latitude of the buoy.
> - `LON`: Longitude of the buoy.
> - `DIST`: Distance to nearest requested waypoint/destination.
> - `HDG`: Heading towards requested waypoint/destination.
> - `WDIR`: Wind direction (in degrees true, from which it is blowing).
> - `WSPD`: Wind speed (in knots).
> - `GST`: Peak 5 or 8 second gust speed (in knots).
> - `WVHT`: Significant wave height (average height of the highest one-third of the waves).
> - `DPD`: Dominant wave period (in seconds) - the period with the maximum wave energy.
> - `APD`: Average wave period (in seconds) of all waves.
> - `MWD`: The direction from which the waves at the dominant period (DPD) are coming.
> - `PRES`: Atmospheric pressure (in inches).
> - `PTDY`: Atmospheric pressure tendency (pressure change in the past three hours).
> - `ATMP`: Air temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit).
> - `WTMP`: Water temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit).
> - `DEWP`: Dewpoint temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit).
> - `VIS`: Visibility (in nautical miles).
> - `TCC`: Total cloud cover (in eighths).
> - `TIDE`: Tide level (measure of water height in relation to a reference point, such as a datum).
> - `S1HT`, `S1PD`, `S1DIR`: Swell 1 height, period, and direction respectively.
> - `S2HT`, `S2PD`, `S2DIR`: Swell 2 height, period, and direction respectively.
> - `Ice`: Ice concentration (the Proportion of sea surface covered by ice).
> - `Sea`: Sea level (height of the tide-surface above the datum).
> - `SwH`, `SwP`, `SwD`: Significant wave height, period, and direction respectively.
> - `WWH`, `WWP`, `WWD`: Wind wave height, period, and direction respectively.
> - `STEEPNESS`: A parameter derived from the wave spectrum representing the sharpness of the wavefronts.
> 
> The hyphens (`-`) represent missing data. For example, in the row you've posted, the `WVHT` (Significant wave height), `DPD` (Dominant wave period), `APD` (Average wave period), `MWD` (Direction from which the waves at the dominant period are coming), and others are missing for buoy `NTKM3` at `0330` GMT.
