**user**:
> When does R make a copy of a list when it's passed to a function? I want to take a tree, constructed using lists of lists of lists... and modify each branch, recursively passing that branch as an argument to a function that modifies it. Is that possible?
**assistant**:
> In R, function arguments behave in a 'copy-on-modify' fashion due to lazy evaluation. That is, R makes a copy of a variable (list or otherwise) passed to a function only when you modify that variable within the function. Prior to that, it's just a reference to the initial variable.
> 
> So to answer your question, yes, you can recursively pass a branch (a sublist) to a function that modifies it. However, remember that if you modify the branch within the function, R will create a copy of the branch. This means that modifications to a branch done inside a function will not affect the original branch unless you explicitly return it.
> 
> Here's a simple example, which could be modified for a complex structure.
> 
> ```R
> modify_tree <- function(tree, new_val){
>   if(is.null(tree)){
>     return(NULL)
>   }
>   tree$value <- new_val 
>   # modify elements of the list
>   for(i in seq_along(tree$children)){
>     tree$children[[i]] <- modify_tree(tree$children[[i]], new_val)
>   }
>   tree
> }
> 
> # Now you can run this on your tree
> tree <- list(value = 1, children = list(list(value = 2, children = NULL), list(value = 3, children = NULL)))
> new_tree <- modify_tree(tree, new_val=10)
> print(new_tree)
> ```
> 
> Within the function `modify_tree`, we're changing the branch directly. Yet, because this triggers copy-on-modify, our changes don't affect the original tree. However, by assigning the result of the function to `new_tree`, we effectively update our entire tree.
> 
> Keep in mind that if your tree is very large, this 'copy-on-modify' behavior might have memory implications. So, it's wise to keep track of the object size and the memory usage whilst working with large and complex data structures.
