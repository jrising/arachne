**user**:
> In powerpoint, how do I make an image only show up after I click past the slide it is on once?
**assistant**:
> To make an image appear on your slide only after you click past the slide once during a presentation in PowerPoint, you need to use the "Animations" feature. Here is a step-by-step guide:
> 
> 1. Navigate to the slide where you want to set up the animation.
> 2. Click to select the image you want to animate.
> 3. In the PowerPoint toolbar, click on the "Animations" tab. 
> 4. In the "Animation" panel, select the animation type you want to apply. For a simple appearance, choose "Appear" or "Fade". These can be found in the "Entrance" category.
> 5. In the right-hand side of the "Animations" tab, you'll see an area named "Advanced Animation". Inside this, click on "Add Animation".
> 6. Now, under the "Start" option in the "Timing" group, choose "After Previous". This configuration will make the image appear after the previous animations or slides have completed.
> 7. Beside the "Start" option in the Timing group, set the delay (if any) for when you want the image to appear after the previous object.
> 
> These set of instructions assumes that you have no other animations on your slide. If you do, you might need to adjust the order of your animations using the "Reorder Animation" function also found in the "Advanced Animation" group.
