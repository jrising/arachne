> How would you pronounce Meliore Foundation?
**assistant**:
> The pronunciation of "Meliore Foundation" would depend largely on how the founders or administrators of the foundation pronounce it. Judging by its Latin roots, one might pronounce it "Meh-lee-or-eh Foundation", but it could also possibly be pronounced "Meh-lee-or Foundation" if following more anglicized pronunciation rules. It would be best to verify with someone directly involved with the foundation to ensure the correct pronunciation is used.
