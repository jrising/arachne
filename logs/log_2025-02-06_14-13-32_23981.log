> Following up on my previous email about SLR and SLCPs, the Board has asked the CCAC to develop some content to support great advocacy with small-island developing states (SIDS) and other potential stakeholders. 
> 
> Were going to put together a short synthesis briefing before the summer which pulls together some of the latest knowledge about SLR, current and projected impacts, and how fast action on SLCPs might reduce the need for adaptation. But I really think, if this is to be impactful, we need to put out something new. I'm wondering whether we could draw from the SLR impacts modelling you're doing for the Economic Assessment?
> 
> We need to produce the synthesis briefing for an oceans summit happening this summer, but I'm thinking we could combine it with a short piece including your impacts results for COP30. What do you think? We could put it out as a parallel product of the Economic Assessment. I'm envisioning this being no more than 5 pages.

> Relatedly, what sorts of SLR-related impacts will you be looking at with PAGE? Or will you only be projecting the rate and cumulative SLR for each of the scenarios?

> Dear Nathan,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Yes, I can contribute to the sea-level rise (SLR) synthesis briefing ahead of the summer oceans summit, and I'm glad to hear about your plans to incorporate SLR impacts modeling in the Economic Assessment.
> 
> While it's important to note that the impact of SLR is relatively minor in the short term, the PAGE model I am using draws from recent updates to the CIAM model. This includes projections of infrastructure damage, mortality, wetland loss, and changes in land value due to SLR. These elements can provide valuable insights into the long-term implications of SLR.

> I agree that presenting this information as a parallel product of the Economic Assessment could be impactful. For further discussion, please find a suitable time for a Zoom call using this link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).
