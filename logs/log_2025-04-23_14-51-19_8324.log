> What is the designation of the scenarios used by the IPCC?
**assistant**:
> The IPCC uses several scenario designations to analyze future climate possibilities. The most recent scenarios are the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which provide a framework for exploring the impact of various socioeconomic trends on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Each SSP combines a narrative with specific quantitative projections. Here are some examples:
> 
> 1. **SSP1**: Sustainability (Taking the Green Road) - Emphasizes a world making significant progress toward sustainability goals.
> 2. **SSP2**: Middle of the Road - Represents a scenario where trends follow historical patterns.
> 3. **SSP3**: Regional Rivalry (A Rocky Road) - Describes a fragmented world with protectionist policies.
> 4. **SSP4**: Inequality (A Road Divided) - Portrays increasing inequalities between and within countries.
> 5. **SSP5**: Fossil-fueled Development (Taking the Highway) - Focuses on rapid development through reliance on fossil fuels.
> 
> These scenarios are assessed in conjunction with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which describe different trajectories of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Each RCP is associated with a radiative forcing value by 2100, such as 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, or 8.5 watts per square meter. Together, SSPs and RCPs provide a comprehensive framework for projecting and analyzing climate futures.

> Should I call the most recent set of these AR6 or CMIP6 scenarios?
**assistant**:
> You should refer to the most recent set of scenarios as **AR6** (the Sixth Assessment Report) when talking about the overarching IPCC report that includes the latest climate assessments and scenarios. 
> 
> However, when discussing the specific climate model scenarios used in research based on these assessments, you would be referring to **CMIP6** (the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6). CMIP6 is the framework of climate models whose outputs are used in the AR6.
> 
> So, in summary:
> - **AR6** for the report and its findings.
> - **CMIP6** for the underlying climate model scenarios used in the analyses contributing to AR6.
