> Dear Professor James Rising,
> 
> It is with great pleasure to write you this email. I am Job Nagarmi Sowah, and I hold a Bachelor of Social Science degree in Economics from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana-West Africa, dating from September 2016 to August 2020. I graduated with a GPA of 3.4 on a 4.0 scale. I am also in my final year of a master's in Petroleum and Energy Studies at the same university, and I hope to finish this November.
> 
> I would like to express my strong interest in joining you in the research at the School of Marine Science and Policy for an MS/Ph.D. in Environmental Economics.
> 
> While researching potential supervisors for my studies, I was deeply impressed by your research area focusing on the impacts of climate change bringing together empirical estimates and integrated assessment models; Modeling of social-environmental systems focusing on complex systems, food and fisheries, and resource management.
> 
>   I came across one of your publications on "The social cost of carbon dioxide under climate-economy feedbacks and temperature variability"  and I was immediately intrigued. Some of the questions that permeated my mind while I went through the work were:
> 
> 
> How can we make models better at estimating the cost of releasing CO2 by considering climate, economic, and extreme events?
> What are the consequences of higher CO2 costs, particularly for countries in the Global South, and how can this help us plan for climate change?
> Your extensive experience in this field is an asset I wish to learn from to find answers to these questions. I believe that your research aligns with my research interests, and am confident that working under your guidance will provide me with the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue a career in environmental economics.
> 
> I have attached my resume and transcripts for your review, and I would be honored to discuss my qualifications and research interests further with you. I believe that your research offers a unique opportunity for me to realize my research goals and make a meaningful contribution to the field of environmental studies
> 
> 
> 
> Thank you immensely for your time and consideration. I eagerly await your response and the prospect of working together.
