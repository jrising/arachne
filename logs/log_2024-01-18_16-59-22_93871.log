**user**:
> When using xr.concat with a new dim name, can you set the coordinates of that dimension?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can assign coordinates to a new dimension when using `xr.concat`.
> 
> If you're using `xr.concat` and adding a new dimension, the values specified in the `dim` argument automatically become the coordinates of the new dimension. These are usually integers starting from 0, ranging to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of arrays you're concatenating.
> 
> However, if you wish to specify or change the coordinates of the new dimension after concatenation, you can use the `.assign_coords()` method on the concatenated DataArray or DataSet. 
> 
> Here is an example:
> 
> ```python
> import xarray as xr
> import numpy as np
> 
> # Create 2 DataArrays
> da1 = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(5, 4), dims=['x', 'y'])
> da2 = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(5, 4), dims=['x', 'y'])
> 
> # Concatenate along a new dimension 'z'
> da3 = xr.concat([da1, da2], dim='z')
> 
> # Assign some specific coordinates to the new dimension 'z'
> coord_values = ['array1', 'array2']
> 
> da3 = da3.assign_coords(z=coord_values)
> ```
> 
> In this example, the new dimension 'z' will now have coordinates 'array1' and 'array2', instead of default coordinates 0 and 1. Be sure that the number of coordinate values you provide matches the length of the new dimension.
