**assistant**:
> In Julia, when you want to throw an error that is intended for the user, rather than a developer error, it's important to provide informative and user-friendly messages. Here are some good practices:
> 
> 1. **Use Standard Error Types**: Julia has a variety of built-in error types, such as `ArgumentError` for invalid function arguments, `DomainError` for values out of expected bounds, and `KeyError` for missing dictionary keys, among others. Choose the most relevant standard error type for clarity.
> 
> 2. **Custom Error Types**: If none of the standard error types fit your needs, you can define your own custom error types by creating a new struct that inherits from `Exception`.
> 
> 3. **Descriptive Messages**: Include clear and concise error messages that explain what went wrong and possibly how to fix it. Assume the user may not be familiar with the internal workings of your code.
> 
> 4. **Use `@error` Logging**: If you want to log errors rather than throw them, the `@error` macro is helpful for emitting log messages that can include values and suggest modifications.
> 
> 5. **Code Readability and Simplicity**: Ensure the error-throwing code is simple and readable to make maintenance easier and reduce the chance of bugs.
> 
> 6. **Localize Errors**: Throw errors as close to the source of the issue as possible. This minimizes the complexity and trace length, helping users pinpoint the problem quickly.
> 
> Here's an example of throwing an error intended for a user:
> 
> ```julia
> function fetch_user_data(user_id)
>     if user_id <= 0
>         throw(ArgumentError("User ID must be greater than zero. Given: $user_id"))
>     end
>     # Implement fetching logic here...
> end
> ```
> 
> This approach provides clear guidance on the error, helping users to understand the problem and how to correct it.
