**user**:
> In ggplot, is there a way to include values in my legend that do not show up in the data?
**assistant**:
> Yes, in `ggplot`, you can include values in your legend that do not show up in the data by using the `scale_*_manual()` function to manually define the legend labels and their associated colors or shapes.
> 
> Here's an example to illustrate how you can achieve this:
> 
> ```R
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Create a data frame with empty values
> df <- data.frame(x = numeric(0), y = numeric(0), category = character(0))
> 
> # Create the plot with an empty data frame
> p <- ggplot() +
>   geom_point(data = df) +
>   guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, color = "blue")), 
>          size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 17, color = "red")))
> 
> # Define custom labels in the legend
> p + scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green"), 
>                        labels = c("Empty Category", "Data Category")) +
>   scale_size_manual(values = c(2, 4), 
>                     labels = c("Empty Category", "Data Category"))
> ```
> 
> In this example, we create an empty data frame `df` with no rows, representing the "Empty Category" that we want to include in the legend. We then use `geom_point()` to add the points to the plot, but since there are no data points in `df`, nothing is shown in the plot. 
> 
> Next, we use `guides()` to customize the legend appearance by overriding the aesthetics for color (`shape = 16`, `color = "blue"`) and size (`shape = 17`, `color = "red"`).
> 
> Finally, we use `scale_color_manual()` and `scale_size_manual()` to manually define the legend labels (`"Empty Category"` and `"Data Category"`) and the associated colors or sizes (`"blue"`, `"green"`, `2`, `4`).
> 
> You can modify this example according to your specific needs, such as changing the aesthetics, legend type, or adding other elements to the plot.
**user**:
> I tried this with my application, but I don't actually see all entries. Just the ones that are in the data.
**assistant**:
> I apologize for the confusion. In `ggplot`, the legend by default only includes values that are present in the data. If you want to display additional legend entries that are not in the data, you can create a separate data frame specifically for the legend labels.
> 
> Here's an updated example that demonstrates how you can achieve this:
> 
> ```R
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Create a data frame with your actual data
> df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3),
>                  y = c(4, 5, 6),
>                  category = c("A", "B", "C"))
> 
> # Create a separate data frame for the legend labels
> legend_labels <- data.frame(category = c("Empty Category", "Data Category"))
> 
> # Create the plot with your actual data
> p <- ggplot(data = df) +
>   geom_point(aes(x, y, color = category, size = category))
> 
> # Define custom labels in the legend using the separate data frame
> p + scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green"), 
>                        breaks = c("Empty Category", "Data Category"), 
>                        labels = c("Empty Category", "Data Category")) +
>   scale_size_manual(values = c(2, 4), 
>                     breaks = c("Empty Category", "Data Category"), 
>                     labels = c("Empty Category", "Data Category"))
> ```
> 
> In this example, we have defined a separate data frame `legend_labels` that includes the legend labels you want to display. Then, in the `scale_color_manual()` and `scale_size_manual()` functions, we specify the `breaks` argument to include the values from the `legend_labels$category` column that don't appear in the actual data. By setting `labels` to the same values, the legend will show these additional entries with their specified labels.

> You can modify the values in `legend_labels` and the corresponding `scale_*_manual()` functions according to your specific legend needs.
