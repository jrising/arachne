**assistant**:
> The time it takes to build a new nuclear power plant, including siting and governance, can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, such as regulatory requirements, local opposition, and construction challenges. However, in general, the process of siting and building a new nuclear power plant can take anywhere from 5 to 10 years or more.
> 
> The siting process typically involves identifying potential locations for the new plant, evaluating the environmental and safety impacts of the proposed site, and obtaining the necessary permits and approvals from local, state, and federal authorities. This process can take several years, depending on the complexity of the project and the level of public opposition.
> 
> Once the siting process is complete, the actual construction of the nuclear power plant can take several years. The construction process involves a number of stages, including site preparation, installation of equipment and systems, and testing and commissioning of the plant. The construction of a new nuclear power plant typically takes several years to complete, and can be subject to delays and cost overruns due to a variety of factors, such as supply chain disruptions, construction challenges, and regulatory issues.
> 
> In summary, the process of siting and building a new nuclear power plant can take anywhere from 5 to 10 years or more, and is subject to a number of factors that can impact the timeline and cost of the project.
