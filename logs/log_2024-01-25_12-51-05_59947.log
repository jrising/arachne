> Is there a way to edit a WordPress page in HTML without it changing the HTML of other parts of the page that you aren't editing?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can edit the HTML of a specific WordPress page without affecting other parts of the website or different pages. Here's how you do it:
> 
> 1. **Edit the page**: On your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the **Pages** menu. Find and click on the page you want to edit. This will bring up the WordPress page editor.
> 
> 2. **Edit as HTML**: By default, most versions of WordPress use a visual editor known as Gutenberg. With each 'block' on this editor, you can change its format from the visual version to an HTML version. This will allow you to view and edit the HTML code for that specific block. To do this, click on the three dots (options) on the block toolbar and select **Edit as HTML**.

> 
> 3. **Edit the HTML**: When you select **Edit as HTML**, the block will change format and you can start editing the HTML code. The changes you make will be specific to that block and will not alter the HTML elsewhere on your site.
> 
> 4. **Preview and save**: Always remember to preview your changes before saving and publishing to ensure that the edits appear as expected. 
> 
> Remember, if you want to edit the HTML of your entire page (as opposed to specific 'blocks') and not just individual content blocks, you might need to directly edit your theme's page templates, and this should ideally be done by a web developer as it involves more advanced coding and understanding of WordPress structure.
