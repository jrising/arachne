> In julia, can I index into a vector with an array of type Vector{Union{Int64, Missing}}, and have the missing indices propagate to missing outputs?
**assistant**:
> In Julia, you can use an array of type `Vector{Union{Int64, Missing}}` to index into another vector, but the behavior you want—where missing indices propagate to missing outputs—is not the default behavior. By default, attempting to index with a `Missing` value will result in an error. However, you can achieve your desired behavior by using a comprehension or a custom function.
> 
> Here is a simple way to propagate `missing` values when using such an array for indexing:
> 
> ```julia
> function safe_indexing(arr, indices)
>     return [ismissing(i) ? missing : arr[i] for i in indices]
> end
> 
> # Example usage:
> v = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
> indices = [1, missing, 3, 2]
> result = safe_indexing(v, indices)
> ```
> 
> In this example, any `missing` value in `indices` results in `missing` in the output `result`, while regular indices are used to index into the vector `v`. The result for this example would be `Vector{Union{Int64, Missing}}([10, missing, 30, 20])`.
**user**:
> Will this be slow?
**assistant**:
> Using a comprehension like the one I provided for indexing will generally be efficient for small to moderately sized vectors. However, performance can degrade with very large vectors due to the overhead of constructing a new array and iterating through the indices.

> ### Factors to Consider for Performance:
> 
> 1. **Size of the Array**: For very large arrays, the overhead of constructing a new result might be noticeable. Julia’s performance typically shines with vectorized operations, so if you're dealing with huge datasets, you might want to avoid explicit loops or comprehensions.
> 
> 2. **Type Stability**: The resultant array type will be `Vector{Union{Int64, Missing}}`, which can be less optimal for operations than strongly typed arrays. Type stability matters for compile-time optimizations.
> 
> 3. **Memory Allocation**: The comprehension will create a new array every time it’s called. If this is done repeatedly in a performance-sensitive context, consider optimizing it.
> 
> ### Alternatives for Speed:
> 
> - **Using `filter!` or `mapslices`**: Depending on your specific use case, there might be other vectorized operations that are inherently faster.
>   
> - **Use `NullableArrays.jl` or `Missings.jl`**: These packages offer additional functionality for dealing with missing data and may provide optimized operations.
> 
> - **Benchmarking**: The best way to assess the performance would be to benchmark your specific use case with `@btime` from the `BenchmarkTools.jl` package to see if this approach meets your needs.
> 
> If performance is a critical concern, it might be worth exploring these alternatives and running some practical tests.
