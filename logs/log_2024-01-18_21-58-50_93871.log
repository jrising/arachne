> When does it make sense to file a joint tax return? I'm employed and make about $100k. My wife was employed at around $90k/yr but lost her job about 6 months ago.
**assistant**:
> In most cases, especially for married couples where both spouses have income, it is beneficial to file a joint tax return. But circumstances can vary, and it may depend on your specific financial situation, tax changes, deductions, tax credits, and whether one party has significant medical expenses.
> 
> A Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) status generally results in lower overall taxes. This is due mainly to the more favorable tax brackets and standard deduction amounts allotted to the status. You also get to claim double the personal exemptions, which are phased out as your income goes to a higher bracket.
> 
> However, there are a couple of situations where it might be more beneficial to file separately:
> 
> 1. Significant Medical Expenses: If one spouse has significant medical expenses and their income is lower, filing separately may allow them to surpass the 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold needed to take the medical expense deduction.
> 
> 2. Concerns About Tax Liability: If there are concerns about incorrect tax return information or possible liability in the future, filing separately might provide some protections.
> 
> From what you've shared, with your wife losing her job 6 months ago, your combined income for the year would likely place you in a lower tax bracket than in previous years. This change, along with MFJ benefits like a higher standard deduction, could mean that a joint filing is beneficial for you.
> 
> However, this should not replace personalized advice from a qualified tax consultant, who can consider all aspects of your income and deductions. Tax law is complex, and overlooking even a small detail can result in a significant financial outcome. It's always best to consult a tax advisor before making a final decision on your tax filing status.
