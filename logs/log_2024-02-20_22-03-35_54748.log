**user**:
> I'm white, with genetic roots in Western Europe (England and Germany). On a project proposal, for an international project, I am being asked to "describe your racial and/or ethnic identity". What should I say?
**assistant**:
> In this context, it is appropriate and straightforward to identify your racial and/or ethnic identity as White of Western European descent, specifically English and German. However, racial and ethnic identities are often complex and can encompass a range of experiences and self-identifications. It's essential to provide information that you feel comfortable with and that best represents your identity.
> 
> Here's a way to write that:
> 
> "I identify as White, with cultural and genetic ancestry rooted in Western Europe, specifically England and Germany. This heritage informs my perspective and approach to life, work, and collaborative international projects."
> 
> Remember that the intention here is likely to understand the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the project team, which enriches the collective understanding and approach to the project. It isn't about assigning value based on ethnicity or race, but recognizing that we all bring different perspectives and experiences to the table.
