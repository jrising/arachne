> Can you write an excel formula that can take either an entry with the letter "x", which we should treat as 0, or a value of the form "37 (1 to 73)" (for any numbers), and extract the first number?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! You can achieve this with a combination of Excel functions. The formula below checks for the presence of the letter "x" and extracts the first number from an entry of the form "37 (1 to 73)":
> 
> ```
> =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("x", A1)), 0, VALUE(LEFT(A1, FIND(" ", A1) - 1)))
> ```
> 
> Here's how it works:
> 
> 1. **`SEARCH("x", A1)`**: Looks for the letter "x" in the cell `A1`.
> 2. **`ISNUMBER(...)`**: Checks if "x" is present in the input.
> 3. **`IF(..., 0, ...)`:** If "x" is found, the formula outputs `0`.
> 4. **`LEFT(A1, FIND(" ", A1) - 1)`**: Extracts the first number by finding the position of the first space in the cell, which is assumed to follow the number, and taking the text before it.
> 5. **`VALUE(...)`**: Converts the extracted text to a number.
> 
> You can replace `A1` with the appropriate cell reference. Let me know if you need further adjustments or explanations!
**user**:
> Great, and now can you provide formula that take the same two kinds of values and return 0 or the first value in the parentheses?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! You can use the following formula to return `0` if the entry is "x" and to extract the first value inside the parentheses for other entries:
> 
> ```excel
> =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("x", A1)), 0, VALUE(MID(A1, FIND("(", A1) + 1, FIND(" ", A1, FIND("(", A1)) - FIND("(", A1) - 1)))
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation:
> 
> 1. **`SEARCH("x", A1)`**: Checks for the presence of the letter "x".
> 2. **`ISNUMBER(...)`**: Validates whether "x" is found.
> 3. **`IF(..., 0, ...)`**: Returns `0` if "x" is present.
> 4. **`FIND("(", A1)`**: Locates the position of the opening parenthesis.
> 5. **`MID(...)`**: Extracts text starting right after the opening parenthesis up to the first space.
> 6. **`FIND(" ", A1, FIND("(", A1))`**: Finds the position of the first space that follows the opening parenthesis.
> 7. **`VALUE(...)`**: Converts the extracted text (the number inside the parentheses) into a number.
> 
> Make sure to replace `A1` with the correct cell reference. Let me know if you need any more modifications!
**user**:
> And finally, the same for the second value in the parentheses?
**assistant**:
> Sure! You can use the following formula to return `0` if the entry is "x" and extract the second value inside the parentheses for other entries:
> 
> ```excel
> =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("x", A1)), 0, VALUE(MID(A1, FIND("to", A1) - 1, FIND(")", A1) - FIND("to", A1) + 1)))
> ```

> ### Explanation:
> 
> 1. **`SEARCH("x", A1)`**: Checks for the presence of "x".
> 2. **`ISNUMBER(...)`**: Validates whether "x" is found.
> 3. **`IF(..., 0, ...)`**: Returns `0` if "x" is present.
> 4. **`FIND("to", A1)`**: Locates the position of the string "to", which indicates the start of the second number.
> 5. **`MID(...)`**: Extracts the text from the position just before "to" up to the closing parenthesis.
> 6. **`VALUE(...)`**: Converts the extracted text (the second number inside the parentheses) into a number.
> 
> Replace `A1` with the relevant cell reference. Let me know if there's anything else you need!
