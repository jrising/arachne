> I think that BASIC had a name for collections of data, where each row was called a RECORD. What was the whole thing called?
**assistant**:
> In BASIC, a collection of data with rows termed as "RECORD" is typically called a "FILE." Each file could store multiple records, and these files were used to manage and manipulate data in BASIC programs. The concept of files and records was central to data management in many early programming languages.

> What could I call this more precisely? I want a name for something that is a collection of fields. "Spreadsheet" suggests that you can do operations on it, but all you can do in the one I'm looking at is read the records and add/modify records. Database suggests that its relational, and this is not that.
