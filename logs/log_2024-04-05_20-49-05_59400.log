**assistant**:
> The error messages suggest that the file is not a properly formatted zip file, or it's a malformed or corrupted zip file. Here are some steps that you could attempt to fix and extract data from your zip file:
> 
> 1. **Try A Different Extraction Tool**: If you're using a built-in OS tool, try a different one. For Linux, you can use `unzip` or `7z x`, for Windows, you can try 7-zip or WinRAR, and for Mac, The Unarchiver or RAR Extractor Free.
> 
> 2. **Repair the Corrupted Zip File**: There are some tools which might be able to repair your zip file. Examples are DiskInternals ZIP Repair for Windows, or `zip -FF /path/to/corrupt.zip --out /path/to/repaired.zip` command in Unix systems including Mac and Linux.
> 
> 3. **Check If It's a 'Zip Bomb'**: A zip bomb is a malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it, because its size—or the number of files or folders it contains—has been intentionally set incredibly high. This does not seem like your case, but if you have any doubts about the source of this zip file, please proceed with extreme caution.
> 
> 4. **Re-Download the File**: There could be issues with the download especially if it's from the web. The download could be incomplete or the file might have been corrupted during the download. Try downloading again.
> 
> 5. **Contact the Source**: If you received this file from someone else, it might be best to reach out to them and let them know about the trouble you're having. They might be able to provide a new, working copy.
> 
> Remember, every step should be done according to the level of familiarity and comfort you have with your system.
