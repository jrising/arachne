> A quantitative and fine-scale understanding of cropping patterns (i.e., the spatial distribution of crop production) is essential for evaluating climate-mediated linkages between crop production and nutritional outcomes in smallholder contexts. Yet this fundamental knowledge is lacking in Nigeria, Senegal, and other countries where traditional agricultural censuses are not regularly executed and limits an accurate picture of the state of agriculture and food security in many African countries and elsewhere,preventing the developing targeted interventions (Kebede et al., 2024). Remote sensing and machine learning techniques offer a novel alternative for gathering agricultural data and evaluating the sensitivity of crop production to current and future climate anomalies. Resolving this agricultural data scarcity challenge in our focus countries is of high expected significance, as this new transferable, scalable approach to crop-type and yield mapping is directly applicable to informing agricultural and food security efforts in other data-scarce regions.
> 
> OBJECTIVES: Quantify field-scale spatial patterns of crop production and examine the influence of current and future climate variability and extremes on crop production. Develop AI-based mapping of staple crop productivity under current and future climate.
> 
> Expected Outcomes:
> Field-scale maps of staple crop productivity with national coverage for Nigeria
> Spatially-detailed estimates of crop yield anomalies under future climate
> Transferable AI-based data pipeline for fine-scale crop mapping in data-scarce landscapes
> 
> Methodology: 
> We will employ remote sensing, deep/machine learning, and on-ground data collection to develop field-scale maps of cropped areas and yields for staple crops (cassava, maize, millets, rice, sorghum, yams) within Nigeria and Senegal.

> Task W2.1: Automated field delineation: Training/validation data of field boundaries will be manually delineated using an existing QGIS labeling platform developed by co-PI Davis. This work is already underway. Locations of data collection will employ a stratified sampling that accounts for cropping intensity and agro-ecological zones. These data will be used to train and test deep learning convolutional neural networks to classify pixels in 3 meter cloud-free composite Planet imagery (Planet Team 2024) into three categories: field edge; field interior; non-field. Pixels classified as field edge and interior will then be merged with the vectorized output of an image segmentation process to generate automated polygons for each field (Fig. 4).  
> 
> Task W2.2: Machine learning data pipeline for crop type mapping: In-country data gathering will collect ground-truth labels for crop type mapping in each field. We will use the Street2Sat pipeline (Paliyam et al., 2021) to convert georeferenced GoPro images into georeferenced labeled (crop-specific) point samples. Led by NASRDA and in coordination with the Senegalese Space Study Agency/Agence Sénégalaise d’Etudes Spatiale (ASES), data will be collected using roof-mounted GoPro Hero 8 cameras. Within each GoPro image, individual plants will be assigned crop-type-specific bounding boxes via object detection (trained using manually labeled images). Combining information on field depth and image direction then allows the GPS coordinates of the vehicle image to be offset into the field (Fig. 5). This crop type ground-truth data will be combined with field-delineated cropland maps (developed above) and seasonal median composite images for each band of Planet imagery and Sentinel 1 & 2 imagery (European Space Agency 2024) and input into Random Forest and Neural Network classifiers to assign a crop type to each individual field.

> Task W2.3: Field-scale yield modeling under current and future climate: Staple crop yields will be estimated following the protocol co-developed by NASRDA and the China National Space Administration. Ground-truth productivity estimates will be collected using handheld georeferenced smartphones equipped with a custom app to photographically evaluate crop status. Spatial yield estimates will be developed using both statistical (e.g., Jin et al., 2019) and process-based crop models (e.g., DSSAT; APSIM) taking into account crop type, soil characteristics, climate conditions, CO2 fertilization, and management practices. In collaboration with the GGCMI (Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison) Project, these models will also be used to evaluate changes in productivity under a suite of future climate scenarios to the year 2050 (specific scenarios to be identified in WP1).

**assistant**:
> I understand the need for concision in grant proposals. Here's a refined version that tries to preserve the key information while eliminating some redundancies and unnecessary details. The main area to reduce is the detailed methodology which can be summarized effectively, as presented below.

> In many African countries, an absence of traditional agricultural censuses impedes accurate evaluation of climate-mediated connections between crop production and nutritional outcomes. Adapting remote sensing and AI learning techniques can help fill this data gap, enabling detailed analysis of crop production sensitivity to climate anomalies.
