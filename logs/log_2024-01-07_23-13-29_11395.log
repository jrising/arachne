> What do these files pertain to?
**assistant**:
> These files are part of a software package called **Pligg CMS**. 
> 
> Pligg Content Management System (CMS) is an open source software that powers various types of social networks. It helps you implement a site where users submit content and decide through votes what's good and what's not, essentially similar to Digg or Reddit. 
> 
> A few key components you can immediately see in that directory structure: 
> 
> - `index.php`: The main file that's usually called when your website URL is accessed. This is typical for most PHP applications.
> - `config.php`: The configuration file for your server's installation of the software.
> - `Smarty.class.php`, `Smarty_Compiler.class.php`, `Config_File.class.php`, etc.: These are parts of [Smarty](https://www.smarty.net/), a templating engine for PHP. Pligg uses this to separate its logic from its presentation, which makes it easier to modify how the site looks without affecting how it works.
> - `plugins` and `modules`: Common locations for extensions and additions to the core Pligg system.
> - `templates`: This is likely where the HTML templates for the site are stored.
> -  Various `.php` files like `submit.php`, `login.php`, `register.php` etc. which are specific webpages or processes in the Pligg-based website. 
> 
> The Pligg README and license files, `Pligg README.txt` and `LICENSE.txt`, should provide more information. This software is no longer actively maintained, but you might get some community support if needed.
