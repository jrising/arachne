**assistant**:
> Several organizations have emerged to track and manage Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by companies. These include:
> 
> 1. **CDP** (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project): This is a non-profit organization that drives companies and governments to reduce their GHG emissions. Companies report their environmental data, including GHG emissions, and the CDP scores them on their climate change efforts.
> 
> 2. **Climate Action 100+**: This investor-led initiative aims to ensure the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change. They drive companies to report their GHG emissions and take steps to reduce them.
> 
> 3. **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)**: GRI develops international standards for sustainability reporting, including GHG emissions. They work with a wide range of companies and other organizations.
> 
> 4. **Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP)**: This is an international collaboration that provides standards, guidance, and tools for companies to measure and manage their GHG emissions.
> 
> 5. **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**: This initiative drives companies to set science-based targets to reduce their GHG emissions. The targets are consistent with keeping global warming to well-below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels.
> 
> 6. **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**: The TCFD provides a framework for companies to disclose their climate-related financial risks and opportunities, including those related to GHG emissions.
> 
> 7. **Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)**: SASB develops and disseminates sustainability accounting standards to help public corporations disclose material, decision-useful information to investors. This includes reporting on GHG emissions.
> 
> These organizations, among others, are working to create accountability and drive change toward a sustainable future.
