> I have a class of 16 students, with different backgrounds and some of them remote. I want them to organize into 4 teams, for a semester-long group project. How can I help them do this?
**assistant**:
> Here are several steps you could take to organize your students into teams for their semester-long project:
> 
> 1. **Identify skills and interests:** Encourage students to share their educational background, areas of interest, and skills on a shared document or discussion board. This can include academic skills (technical skills, research experience), but also 'soft' skills (communication, project management, teamwork). Everyone should describe their current situation and time commitment.
> 
> 2. **Form teams based on diversity:** Communication across difference is far more productive than between those with the same perspectives. Create teams that consist of students with various educational backgrounds, skills, and interests. The ideal is for each student to have something unique to bring to their team, and something to learn from someone else. 
> 
>    However, also ensure that there is enough commonality for the team members to work well together. For example, forming a team entirely of students who are in drastically time-zones might not be beneficial for their collective productivity. 
> 
> 3. **Set clear guidelines and expectations:** Once the teams are formed, set clear expectations and guidelines for each group. This could include tips on effective team communication, conflict resolution strategies, the importance of deadlines, etc. 
> 
> 4. **Use online collaboration tools:** As your class includes remote students, you will need online collaboration tools. Show them options like Trello for project management, Google Docs for synchronous writing, and GitHub for collaborative programming. Slack or Microsoft Teams can facilitate communication between the teams.
> 
> 5. **Monitor and provide help if needed:** Regularly check in on each team to know how they are doing and provide help if they're facing any obstacles in their group dynamics. It would be helpful to request a brief update report from each team periodically. This report could include their progress, any challenges, and how they are strategizing to overcome them.
> 
> 6. **Change the teams if needed:** If some groups are persistently experiencing problems or conflicts, consider modifying the teams. It's important to foster an environment that promotes healthy and effective group work, and sometimes, regrouping may be the best option.
> 
> This structure should empower each student to participate fully and learn deeply from the project. Ensure that teams are given the flexibility to define their own internal roles and operations, as far too prescriptive a team structure may hamper their creativity.
