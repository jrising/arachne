> The following prompt asks for a drafted document in James's
> voice. Please keep the following in mind in writing it:
> 
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> Conditional Features
> 
> Academic Papers: In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."
> 
> Personal Letters: Your personal letter shows a warmer and more emotional tone. You use rich, descriptive language and share personal anecdotes to create a sense of intimacy and connection. You also show a playful and creative side, like how you derived meanings and historical connections in your son's name. "You are named after the chemical symbol for gold, Au (â˜‰), the most versatile of the metals, in honor of your great-grandmother, Goldie Newman..."
> 
> Writing for the Public: In public-oriented writing, you adopt a more accessible, explanatory style. Your writing is more focused on communicating complex ideas in an easy-to-understand manner. You balance your expertise with clarity and relevance to ensure the material is accessible to a broad audience. "Agriculture is going to be one of the sectors most disrupted by climate change. Our ability to produce food relies on a stable climate. Crops and management practices are carefully catered to local climate conditions, including the timing and intensity of rainfall, the length of growing seasons, and the complex biology of soil."

> Please summarize key results from the individual sectors (all except for the total damages) in text. Whenever describing an estimate, report the 90% confidence interval as well, such as "The largest losses at end-of-century are from catastrophic risks, estimated at 4.1% [-2.8 - 11.9%] under current policies. Following a high mitigation pathway would reduce these impacts by 2.9 pp [-2.0 - 8.6 pp]." Report all percentages rounded to one decimal point. Write the whole discussion as it might appear in an academic paper.
**assistant**:
> The following discussion distills key findings from our detailed cross-sector assessment on the potential impacts of climate change on the global economy, including those elements labeled as "Contributing Results" in the results table. All impacts are reported as a percentage of GDP, inclusive of market and non-market costs, and potential catastrophic risks. As we are interested in the uncertainty of these results, 90% confidence intervals are provided for each estimate. Furthermore, we compare the contrasting scenarios of "Current Policies" and "High Mitigation" to elucidate potential economic outcomes and the possible benefits of aggressive climate change mitigation.
> 
> We start with an examination of loss estimates associated with drought and inland flooding, amplified by CGE effects and excluding double-counting. Our estimates suggest that under current policy conditions, by the end of the century (2081-2100), losses could amount to 0.6% [-0.1 - 1.2%]. If high mitigation strategies are pursued, these losses would be limited to 0.1% [-0.02 - 0.3%], an expected change of 0.4 pp [0.1 - 0.9 pp].
> 
> Next, we move to losses in the agricultural sector. By 2081-2100, under current policies, we expect a loss of 0.2% [0.04 - 0.3%], but under the high mitigation scenario, these losses are predicted to be minimized to 0.01% [-0.04 - 0.08%], an expected beneficial change of 0.2 pp [0.03 - 0.3 pp].
> 
> Despite the potential losses in agriculture, livestock and fisheries could experience a substantial swing. Under current policies, by 2081-2100, the economic impact could be a gain of 0.4% [-0.2 - 1.2%]; however, under high mitigation policies, the estimated swing is less substantial at -0.1% [-0.2 - 0.1%]. This suggests an expected change of 0.5 pp [-0.1 - 1.1 pp].
> 
> Ecosystem impacts represent another area for concern. Under current policies, by 2081-2100, we may see a positive change of 0.1% [-0.1 - 0.4%]. However, high mitigation strategies could limit this positive impact to -0.1% [-0.1 - 0.1%], resulting in an expected change of 0.2 pp [-0.1 - 0.4 pp].
> 
> Significant losses in GDP are predicted due to impacts on energy supply and demand. Our estimates show a potential loss of 0.7% [0.3 - 0.9%] by 2081-2100 under current policies. Implementing high mitigation strategies could limit the loss to 0.7% [0.2 - 0.9%], with a potential reduction of 0.05 pp [-0.5 - 0.6 pp].
> 
> Label productivity losses are also anticipated to be significant. By 2081-2100, under current policies, we predict a loss of 1.2% [0.9 - 1.4%]. However, high mitigation can considerably reduce these losses to 0.8% [0.1 - 1.1 pp], indicating an expected change of 0.4 pp [-0.1 - 0.9 pp].
> 
> It's worth noting that the highest losses by the end of the century could be attributable to catastrophic risks, estimated at 4.1% [-2.8 - 11.9%] under current policies. Following a high mitigation pathway would reduce these impacts by 2.9 pp [-2.0 - 8.6 pp].
> 
> In summary, our damage estimates highlight the considerable economic risk of current policy pathways and underline the significant potential benefits of implementing high mitigation strategies across multiple sectors.
