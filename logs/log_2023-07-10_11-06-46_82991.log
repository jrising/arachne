**assistant**:
> The term for the decrease in temperature with elevation is "lapse rate." Specifically, the term is used in meteorology to denote the rate of decrease with altitude for atmospheric pressure, temperature, and density. The standard atmospheric lapse rate for temperature is an average decrease of about 6.5°C per 1000m (or roughly 2°C per 1,000 feet) of increased height.
