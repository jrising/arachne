> I would like to read events from an ics calendar updated online, into python. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> To read events from an online ICS (iCalendar) calendar in Python, you can use the `icalendar` library along with `requests` to fetch the file. Here's a straightforward example to get you started:
> 
> 1. **Install necessary packages**:
>    ```bash
>    pip install icalendar requests
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Fetch and parse the ICS file**:
>    ```python
>    import requests
>    from icalendar import Calendar
> 
>    # URL of the online ICS calendar
>    ics_url = 'https://example.com/calendar.ics'
> 
>    # Fetch the ICS file from the URL
>    response = requests.get(ics_url)
>    response.raise_for_status()  # Ensure we notice bad responses
> 
>    # Parse the ICS file
>    calendar = Calendar.from_ical(response.content)
> 
>    # Iterate through the events in the calendar
>    for component in calendar.walk():
>        if component.name == "VEVENT":
>            event_summary = component.get('summary')
>            event_start = component.get('dtstart').dt
>            event_end = component.get('dtend').dt
>            print(f"Event: {event_summary}")
>            print(f"Start: {event_start}")
>            print(f"End: {event_end}")
>            print("-" * 20)
>    ```
> 
> In this code:
> - `requests.get(ics_url)` fetches the ICS calendar from the specified URL.
> - `Calendar.from_ical(response.content)` parses the calendar content.
> - `calendar.walk()` iterates through the calendar components to find events (`VEVENT`).
> - For each event, it extracts and prints the summary, start time, and end time.
> 
> Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs! If you have any follow-up questions or need further assistance, just let me know.

**assistant**:
> It seems like the response content you are getting is an HTML page (possibly an error page or the login page) rather than the expected ICS calendar data. 
> 
> To resolve the issue, you need to make sure that the URL you are using to fetch the calendar points directly to the raw ICS file and not to a webpage. Typically, you would need to find the direct link to the ICS file if it's hosted online.
> 
> Here are a couple of things you can try:
> 
> 1. **Check the URL**: Ensure that the URL you are using is the direct link to the ICS file itself and not a webpage that hosts the calendar.
> 
> 2. **Authentication**: If the calendar requires authentication to access, you may need to provide credentials in the request headers.
> 
> After confirming that you have the correct URL and ensuring that you are able to access the ICS file directly, try running the code again to fetch and parse the ICS calendar data. If you encounter any further issues or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
**user**:
> This is the URL, which ends in .ics, but when I try to visit in my browser, it sends me to my google calendar:
> https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/nytimes.com_89ai4ijpb733gt28rg21d2c2ek@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
**assistant**:
> The URL you provided seems to be a Google Calendar link that redirects to the actual ICS calendar file. When you try to access this URL in a browser or through a direct request, Google Calendar will handle the link and may not return the raw ICS data directly for parsing.
> 
> To access the raw ICS data from a Google Calendar link like this, you may need to authenticate yourself and then retrieve the calendar data. Google Calendar APIs would be more suitable for accessing Google Calendar data programmatically.
> 
> Here's a general outline of how you can approach this using the Google Calendar API:
> 
> 1. **Set up Google Calendar API**:
>    - Go to the Google API Console and create a new project.
>    - Enable the Google Calendar API for your project.
>    - Create credentials (API key or OAuth client ID) for accessing the API.
> 
> 2. **Use the API in Python**:
>    - Install the Google API client library:
>      ```bash
>      pip install google-api-python-client
>      ```
> 
> 3. **Fetch the Calendar Events**:
>    - Use the Google Calendar API to retrieve the calendar events.
>
