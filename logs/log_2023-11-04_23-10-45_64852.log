**user**:
> I am using webkitSpeechRecognition, but after receiving whatever audio, I want it to send off the text to my service for processing. Currently, it never seems to decide the audio is done. Here is my setup:

> 	// Setup for note-taking
> 	speechRecognition.continuous = true;
> 	speechRecognition.interimResults = true;
> 	speechRecognition.lang = 'en-US';

**assistant**:
> To get webkitSpeechRecognition to stop after a reasonable pause, you can use the `onresult` event and a timer.

> Here's how to do it:
> 
> ```javascript
> let speechRecognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
> speechRecognition.continuous = true;
> speechRecognition.interimResults = true;
> speechRecognition.lang = 'en-US';
>

>     const silenceDuration = 3000; // duration in ms, adjust to fit

>         silenceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
>             recognition.stop();
>         }, silenceDuration);
>     }
> })();
> 
> speechRecognition.onstart = () => {
>     stopListeningAfterSilence(speechRecognition);
> }
> 
> speechRecognition.onresult = (event) => {
>     const text = event.results[event.results.length - 1][0].transcript.trim();
>     // send this text to your service
>     // ...
> 
>     stopListeningAfterSilence(speechRecognition); 
> }
> 
> speechRecognition.start();
> ```
> 
> Here, a timer is set up that is restarted every time an `onresult` event is fired. If no `onresult` events are fired for a specified amount of time, `recognition.stop()` is called and the speech recognition stops listening. Note that the `stopListeningAfterSilence` function is immediately invoked to return another function which we then call, ensuring that our timer ID (`silenceTimer`) is private and can't be accidentally altered elsewhere in your program.

> You can adjust `silenceDuration` to specify the amount of acceptable silence before the recognition stops. This value is in milliseconds, so a value of 3000 corresponds to 3 seconds.
