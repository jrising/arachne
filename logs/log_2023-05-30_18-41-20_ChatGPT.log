> What is the name for a minor adjustment on a vector of results? I think it's a name like "permutation" but I don't mean for the vector to be reordered.

> The term you might be looking for is "perturbation." In the context of vectors or numerical results, a perturbation refers to a small or minor adjustment applied to the values in the vector without necessarily changing their order. Perturbations are often used in numerical analysis, optimization algorithms, or sensitivity analysis to study the effects of small changes in the input on the output.
