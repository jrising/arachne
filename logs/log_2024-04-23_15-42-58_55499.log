**assistant**:
> The "energy efficiency paradox" or "energy paradox" is a concept that has generated a significant body of literature in economics. This phenomena refers to the observation that energy-efficient technologies, which could theoretically save energy and money, are often not adopted.
> 
> Below, you will find some notably important research articles and books which are regarded as contributory to understanding this paradox:
> 
> 1. **"The Rebound Effect: An Assessment of the Evidence for Economy-Wide Energy Savings from Improved Energy Efficiency"** by Steve Sorrell. *(2007)* A thorough review of the literature on the rebound effect, which is often cited in discussions of the energy efficiency paradox.
> 
> 2. **"Consumers' Misestimation, Product Unreliability, or Reference Dependence? A Micro-level Investigation of the Energy Efficiency Paradox"** by Borenstein, S. *(2015)* - This journal from American Economic Review includes examination of plausible reasons for the energy paradox such as unreliability of products or misinterpretation by users.
> 
> 3. **"The Energy Efficiency Gap: What Does It Mean?"** by Jaffe, A. B., & Stavins, R. N. *(1994)* This study explores reasons behind why certain energy-efficient technologies are not adopted when they seem cost-effective.
> 
> 4. **"Anomalies: The Energy Efficiency Gap"** by Allcott, H., & Greenstone, M. *(2012)* This paper, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, provides an overview of behavioral factors that could explain the energy efficiency paradox.
> 
> 5. **"Energy Efficiency Economics and Policy"** by Gillingham, K., Newell, R., & Palmer, K. *(2009)* This Annual Review of Environment and Resources article gives a broad overview of energy efficiency and policy issues, including the efficiency gap.
> 
> 6. **"Understanding the human dimension of clean energy transitions"** by Sovacool, B. K., & Furszyfer Del Rio, D. D. *(2020)* This Nature Energy piece presents a more recent examination of the sociotechnical aspects of energy transitions, which naturally encompass efficiency and the decisions surrounding it.
> 
> 7. **"Barriers and Drivers to Energy Efficiency: A New Taxonomy"** by Oikonomou, V., Becchis, F., Steg, L., & Russolillo, D. *(2009)* - This explores the different barriers and incentives to energy efficiency in the residential sector, offering a different perspective on the energy paradox.
> 
> Note: These references are useful starting points, but the study on the energy efficiency paradox is vast and continues to evolve with ongoing analysis and research.
