> I am resampling across results from multiple models in a meta-analysis, using their R2. Is this standard, and can I relate it to inverse variance weighting?
**assistant**:
> Resampling across results from multiple models using \( R^2 \) is not the most standard approach for meta-analysis. Typically, meta-analyses use effect sizes or coefficients and weight them by the inverse of their variance, known as inverse variance weighting. This method accounts for the uncertainty in each estimate.
> 
> Using \( R^2 \) could be informative in assessing model fit, but it isn't typically directly related to inverse variance weighting. The \( R^2 \) value represents the proportion of variance explained by a model but doesn't provide information about the precision or variance of the estimates themselves, which is what inverse variance weighting relies on.
> 
> If you're interested in a meta-analytic approach that incorporates the model's explanatory power, you might consider a hierarchical meta-regression analysis where you could include \( R^2 \) as a covariate to study its influence on outcomes. However, remember that direct resampling based on \( R^2 \) doesn't substitute for considering the variance corresponding to the effect sizes or coefficients involved.
