>  - Masters in Marine Policy: Explain that this program has now

>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)
>    which has a Marine track.
>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
>    or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
>    prospective students.
>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &
>    Policy school: In this case, suggest that the applicant reach out
>    to Carlos Moffat <cmoffat@udel.edu>.

> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope you are having a great day. I am writing to introduce myself and let you know I am interested in your research lab. I graduated from the Department of Zoology at Jagannath University (JnU) in May 2024 with a major in Zoology. I intend to apply for my graduate studies in the Fall of '25. 
> 
> I am very interested in your research on modeling social-environmental systems and assessing climate change impacts on fisheries and resource management. Through my work in sustainable aquaculture and conservation, I’ve developed an understanding of how climate shifts influence fisheries and community practices. My projects, such as optimizing stocking densities and studying local fisheries, have focused on practical resource management under changing environmental pressures. I am especially drawn to the opportunity to explore integrated modeling approaches in your lab and would be thrilled to contribute to your team.
> 
> I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect with you briefly to discuss your research work and answer any questions you may have. Please let me know if you are available for a brief call or email exchange at your convenience. I am listing my profile below; I've also attached my resume and academic transcript for your review.

> IELTS: 7.0/9.0 – (Listening: 8.0, Reading: 6.5, Writing: 6.0, Speaking: 7.0)

> Research Experience: 1 Project Work + 2 Term Papers
> 
> I worked as a research assistant on a project on “Impact of Stocking Densities on Survivability and Growth Performance of Crablet at Nursing in Hapa Stage” aimed to optimize the stocking densities and pond habitats for better survival, intactness, and growth of orange mud crab juveniles by regular monitoring of water quality parameters (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, and total ammonia), which is currently awaiting publication.
> 
> In my undergraduate term paper, I worked on “Prospects and Problems of Soft-shell Crab Farming in the Southwest Region of Bangladesh” where we (our team) traveled to a coastal region (Satkhira) to explore the possibilities and difficulties of soft-shell crab farming in the Southwest part of Bangladesh as well as the socioeconomic and ecological conditions by interviewing the farmers and key stakeholders.
> 
> Besides, I also worked on “A study on Sharks and Rays in Dhaka City’s Fish Market”. I visited various fish markets in Dhaka to identify the species of sharks and rays being trafficked, evaluate their market prices, understand the factors driving the demand for their meat, and assess their conservation status (IUCN status).

**assistant**:
> Certainly! Before I draft a response, let's identify any specific questions or core confusions in Abdullah Al Maruf's email:
> 
> 1. **Interest in Discussion**: Abdullah requests a brief conversation to discuss your research and to answer any questions you might have. This isn't a direct question but rather a request for engagement.
> 
> 2. **Academic Background and Interests**: Abdullah has outlined his background and research interests clearly, but he has not specified which program he is interested in applying to. However, based on his interests in fisheries, aquaculture, and modeling social-environmental systems, he may be considering programs related to marine or environmental sciences.
> 
> There's no mention of a specific geographic location that ties Abdullah to Delaware or the Mid-Atlantic area, nor does he have schoolwork affiliations with MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD.
> 
> Based on this analysis, Abdullah seems interested but lacks clarity on the specific program he wishes to apply for. Therefore, it would be beneficial to direct him to the form that helps identify the best program for his interests. 
> 
> Now, here's a draft response:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Abdullah,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in my research. I appreciate the overview of your background and your work on sustainable aquaculture and conservation.
> 
> As we aim to better connect prospective students like yourself with suitable academic programs and potential advisors, I would like to direct you to a form we have developed. It will help clarify which program aligns best with your interests and background:
> 
> [https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7](https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7)
> 
> Should your interests align with interdisciplinary quantitative modeling, particularly in climate change risks and food systems, I encourage you to mention me in your statement of purpose for consideration in our Ph.D. program. Please be aware that while there is limited funding, applying by December 1 will maximize your chance for full consideration.
