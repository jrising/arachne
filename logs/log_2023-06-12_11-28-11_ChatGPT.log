> What is the difference between an epidemiologist and a public health person, when it comes to the health risks of climate change?
**assistant**:
> Epidemiologists and public health professionals both play crucial roles in understanding and responding to the health risks posed by climate change, but their roles and responsibilities can differ significantly.

> Epidemiologists are specialists in the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations. They are essentially "disease detectives" who investigate and describe the determinants and distribution of disease. In the context of climate change, epidemiologists would typically be involved in studying the link between specific climate change phenomena (like heat waves, increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters, changes in vector-borne disease patterns, etc.) and their impact on health outcomes. Their work helps in establishing causal relationships, predicting trends, and developing strategies for prevention and control.
> 
> Public health professionals, on the other hand, have a broader role that encompasses the health of entire populations, rather than just the study of diseases. While some public health professionals are epidemiologists, others work in various other capacities. They may work in policy making, health education, community health promotion, health services administration, environmental health, and many other areas. In terms of climate change, public health professionals might look at how to create systems and policies that can mitigate the health impacts of climate change. This could include developing early warning systems for heatwaves or storms, improving water and sanitation infrastructure to prevent disease outbreaks after floods, or planning urban spaces to reduce the urban heat island effect and air pollution.

> In essence, while epidemiologists would conduct the research to understand the health risks of climate change, public health professionals would take that research and use it to implement policies and programs to protect public health. These roles, of course, can overlap, and many professionals may work in both areas, particularly in a field as interdisciplinary as climate change and health.
