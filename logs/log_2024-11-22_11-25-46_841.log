> 
> 4. **The Weingart Foundation**: They support social and economic equity in Southern California, which can include addressing sustainability as a social justice issue.
> 
> 5. **Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation**: DiCaprio's foundation specifically supports projects around climate change, conservation, and biodiversity, which align well with IMT's sustainability-oriented work.

> Remember, when seeking funding or partnerships, it's crucial to frame your request around how your work benefits the foundation's mission and goals. You might not find a foundation specifically looking to support IMT work, but many are likely to see the value in it when presented in a way that aligns with their priorities.
