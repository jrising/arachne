> The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Said another way, using subsets of the indicators would have produced a more accurate or robust result, and as new indicators are added beyond this, the value of the analysis was reduced. Vulnerability is not, as section 2.2.3 suggestions, sector agnostic.

It will be also clearer for me, to distinguish what you would consider desirable or optimal (but perhaps cannot suggest to adopt a different approach at this point in time) and what specific corrective measures you think they could and should implement

> The structure follows reasonable best-practices. However, the best-practices used are most appropriate in contexts where knowledge transfer is not needed. It is not clear how the group of 10 stakeholders will be equipped to all understand and evaluate the range of possible operational action plan actions.
> 
> The meaning of ”impact levels” is not provided. What is being impacted by what? Upon what dimension are impacts rated as low or high? How could an impact change its impact level—over time, group, process, or something else? Figure 6 suggests that the authors are imagining impacts levels to refer to different degrees of climate impacts, but given that this is dependent upon adaptation practices, this application would also remain unclear. Section 3.3 suggests that it is adaptation actions that are being rated, but I do not know how.
> 
> It should be clarified that the limited number of participants (target of 10) reflects embedded limitations of the work. A larger group of stakeholders is preferable, but would require a larger number of workshops and processes to translate across workshops. However, the project assigned limited resources, allowing only 10 stakeholders, and that also limits the applicability of this demonstration.

> The structure follows reasonable best practices. However, please clarify how the chosen practices apply in contexts where knowledge transfer is essential. It is not clear how the group of 10 stakeholders will be equipped to fully understand and evaluate the range of possible operational actions. Consider adding strategies or guidance on how to facilitate this understanding among the stakeholders.
> 
> The term "impact levels" needs clear definition. Please specify what is being impacted and by what. Additionally, clarify the dimensions on which impacts are rated as low or high. Explain how an impact could change its level—whether over time, based on group feedback, process evolution, or other factors. Figure 6 seems to suggest that impact levels refer to degrees of climate impacts; please elaborate on this connection, particularly as it relates to adaptation practices.
> 
> It should be explicitly stated that the limited target of 10 participants reflects inherent limitations of the work. While a larger group of stakeholders is preferable, acknowledge that this would require expanded workshops and processes to ensure effective communication across sessions. Given the project's constraints and limited resources, please explain how having only 10 stakeholders affects the applicability of this demonstration.

> Lappeenranta: Based on their responses, the workshop participants appear to be managers of the relevant urban systems. As a result, they select adaptation pathways without need for coordination outside their sector (e.g., avoiding education and policy change), and tend to see policy-maker attitudes as the main barrier to broader change.
> 
> Egaleo and Oristano: TransformAr partners performed the development and selection of the pathways for both of these demonstrators. The text suggests that the technical partner for the Municipality and stakeholders were involved in this step. Also, the impact levels and level thresholds are poorly defined in both cases. In the case of Oristano’s biodiversity KCS, there was also no stakeholder input to the action plans.

> 
> **Lappeenranta**: Based on their responses, the workshop participants appear to be managers of the relevant urban systems. Please clarify how their selection of adaptation pathways could benefit from coordination with other sectors, such as education and policy change. This would help address the tendency to view policy-maker attitudes as the main barrier to broader change.
> 
> **Egaleo and Oristano**: TransformAr partners were responsible for developing and selecting the pathways for both demonstrators. Please specify the role of the technical partners for the Municipality and stakeholders in this process. Additionally, the definitions of impact levels and level thresholds are vague in both cases. It would be beneficial to provide clear criteria for these definitions.
> 
> In the case of Oristano’s biodiversity KCS, please clarify the lack of stakeholder input in the action plans. Discuss how incorporating stakeholder feedback could strengthen the action plans and improve their relevance to the local context.
