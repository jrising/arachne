> There are several methods of sampling used when running Monte Carlo simulations:
> 
> 1. **Simple Random Sampling**: This is the most straightforward method. Each member of the population has an equal chance of being picked during each draw. It's easy to implement and understand, but it may not perform well with high-dimensional data or when the domain of interest occupies only a small region of the total probability space.
> 
> 2. **Stratified Sampling**: The target population is divided into non-overlapping groups or strata. Then, simple random sampling is performed within each group. This can yield a lower variance estimator than simple random sampling, especially when the stratification is chosen well.
> 
> 3. **Importance Sampling**: In this method, the original probability distribution of the problem is altered to a distribution which is easier to sample from and is proportional to the original distribution. This method is particularly useful when the area of interest is a small fraction of the total probability space. 
> 
> 4. **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**: In LHS, the distribution function is divided into segments of equal probability. One sample is selected at random from each segment, ensuring spread of the samples over the entire range of each variable.
> 
> 5. **Quasi-Random (or Low-Discrepancy) Sequences**: These include Sobol and Halton sequences, among others. They create sequences that fill the space more uniformly than random numbers would. 
> 
> 6. **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: In this method, instead of making independent draws, the next sample is generated based on the current sample, forming a Markov chain. MCMC algorithms, including the well-known Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms, are commonly used when the distribution we want to sample from is complex and high-dimensional.
> 
> 7. **Resampling Methods**: This includes bootstrapping, jackknifing, and permutation tests. These are mainly used for estimating the variability of a statistic from an empirical distribution.
> 
> Every method has its advantages and challenges, and the choice should be based on your specific problem and goals for the analysis. For complex situations, you may find yourself combining strategies in innovative ways.
