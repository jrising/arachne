**assistant**:
> When agreeing to be a reviewer on an ongoing grant project, various situations could classify as conflicts of interest. Here are some key types to be aware of:
> 
> 1. **Financial Interests**: If you have any financial stake or expectation of financial gain linked to the project's success or failure, this would be a conflict. This includes holding stocks, getting consultancy fees, or any monetary relationship with entities involved in the project.
> 
> 2. **Personal Relationships**: Personal relationships with any of the project's investigators, such as close friendships, family ties, or romantic relationships, can compromise objectivity.
> 
> 3. **Professional Relationships**: Collaboration with any of the project's investigators, such as being co-authors on recent publications, or working together on other projects, could bias your review.
> 
> 4. **Institutional Affiliations**: If you or your institution stand to benefit or lose from the project's results, that would be a conflict. This can include direct institutional partnerships with those running the project.
> 
> 5. **Competing Interests**: If you have a project or interest that competes with the one you are reviewing, this might introduce bias in your evaluation.
> 
> 6. **Prior Involvement**: Having been significantly involved in the project's previous phases could bias your perspective if you are asked to evaluate ongoing efforts objectively.
> 
> If any of these or similar situations apply, it's essential to disclose them to the party requesting the review. They can then decide whether these connections constitute a disqualifying conflict. Transparency is key.
