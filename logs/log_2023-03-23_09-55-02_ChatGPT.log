**assistant**:
> The University of Delaware offers several programs and resources to help students who need remedial math help. However, I'm not aware of any specific certificate programs designed solely for this purpose.
> 
> One resource that the University of Delaware provides is the Math Resource Center, which offers free tutoring services to all UD students. The center is staffed by math graduate students who are trained to help students with a wide range of math topics, from basic arithmetic to advanced calculus.
> 
> Another resource is the Supplemental Instruction (SI) program, which provides group study sessions for students taking difficult courses, including math courses. The SI sessions are led by trained student leaders who have already taken and excelled in the course, and they offer tips on study techniques, test-taking strategies, and problem-solving methods.
> 
> Additionally, the University of Delaware offers a range of math courses at different levels of difficulty, and students can work with their advisors to find courses that are appropriate for their skill level. Students who need extra help can also seek assistance from their professors during office hours or by scheduling individual appointments.
> 
> In summary, while the University of Delaware does not offer a specific certificate program for remedial math help, there are many resources available to students who need extra assistance, including free tutoring, group study sessions, and access to math courses at different levels of difficulty.
