> There are a few steps you can take to determine if your Mac recognizes the connected music keyboard:
> 
> 1. **Check System Information:**
>    - Go to `Applications` > `Utilities` > `System Information`.
>    - In the System Information window, look under the `USB` section in the left sidebar.
>    - You should see your music keyboard listed under one of the USB ports. If it's not listed, the Mac is not recognizing the device, indicating a possible issue with the connection or cable.
> 
> 2. **Test with Another USB Port:**
>    - Try reconnecting the keyboard using a different USB port on your Mac. Sometimes, ports can be faulty.
> 
> 3. **Try a Different Cable:**
>    - If another USB port doesn't work, try using a different USB cable to rule out cable issues.
> 
> 4. **Reset the MIDI Configuration:**
>    - Go to `Applications` > `Utilities` > `Audio MIDI Setup`.
>    - Open the `MIDI Studio` window (Cmd + 2).
>    - If your device appears there, but still isn’t working properly, you can try resetting the MIDI configuration.
>    - Go to `MIDI Studio` > `File` > `Reset MIDI Studio`.
> 
> 5. **Check Security & Privacy Settings:**
>    - Go to `System Settings` (or `System Preferences`) > `Security & Privacy` and ensure that there's no prompt or block related to your music keyboard.
> 
> 6. **Update Software:**
>    - Ensure both your macOS and GarageBand are up to date, as updates might solve compatibility or recognition issues.
> 
> By going through these steps, you should be able to determine whether there’s a connectivity issue or if the cable needs to be replaced. If everything seems fine on the hardware side and the issue persists, then it might be worth checking online forums for any specific issues with your keyboard model.
