**user**:
> I remember a creature from mythology that's like a giant turtle, but so big that trees grow on its back and people mistake it for a deserted island. What is that?
**assistant**:
> The creature you are thinking of is known as an Aspidochelone in medieval Christian folklore. Often mistaken for an island and described as a sea monster, it is typically pictured as a giant whale or turtle. It's so large that it has trees growing on its back, leading sailors to venture onto it, mistaking it for a deserted island. As the myth goes, when the sailors light fires on its back, the Aspidochelone would sink into the sea, drowning those unfortunate enough to be on it. This creature also appears in various forms across different cultures' folklore and mythology.
**user**:
> Is there a name for an area in the ocean where gravity causes the water to dip like a bowl? This might be more fantasy than reality, but I'm not sure.
**assistant**:
> The phenomenon you are referring to is often called an "oceanic basin" or "oceanic trench." These are real geological features found in the Earth's oceans. Trenches are elongated, narrow depressions on the ocean floor that are formed by tectonic plate subduction, where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. They can stretch for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers and can be several kilometers deep.
> 
> While they may not resemble a perfectly symmetrical bowl, trenches do have a concave shape due to the bending of the Earth's crust caused by the subduction process. Gravity does play a role in shaping these features, as the weight of the overly thickened crust contributes to the downward bending, creating a trough-like structure.
> 
> It's important to note that oceanic trenches are natural features, and while they don't exactly match the concept of a bowl, they do exhibit certain characteristics that might give the impression of a dipping bowl. However, as far as I'm aware, there isn't a specific term for an ocean area that perfectly resembles the image you described, which seems to lean more towards a fantastical representation.
**user**:
> I'm specifically thinking of the surface of the water being like a bowl, in that ships have to sail uphill to leave. Does that happen?
**assistant**:
> Ah, I see what you're referring to now. The concept you're imagining, where ships have to sail uphill to leave an area due to the shape of the water's surface, is known as a "tidal bore" or "tidal wave." However, it's important to note that tidal bores occur in rivers and estuaries rather than in the open ocean.
> 
> A tidal bore is a natural phenomenon that happens when incoming tides force water up a river or narrow channel, creating a wave or surge that travels against the current. This can result in the water appearing to rise like a wall or a bowl, causing the illusion that ships have to sail uphill to leave the area.
> 
> One famous example of a tidal bore occurs in the Qiantang River in China, where the tides can push a large wave upstream against the flow of the river. The Severn Estuary in the United Kingdom also experiences tidal bore activity.
> 
> In the open ocean, the influence of tides on water surface elevation is typically not significant enough to create the uphill effect you mentioned. Tides in the open ocean generally result in a cyclic rise and fall of the water level, but the overall effect on the surface shape is more gradual and does not create a noticeable "bowl" or uphill sailing experience for ships.
> 
> So, while tidal bores can produce the effect you imagined in specific river or estuary settings, this phenomenon is not typically observed in the open ocean.
