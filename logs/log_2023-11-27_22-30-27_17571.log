> the Benefits and Costs of environmental Protection
> the previous chapter proposed a destination—economic efficiency—for our journey, but it didn’t give us a road map or even a compass. imagine you are a policymaker deciding whether to approve construction of a hy- droelectric dam on a wild river.even if you embrace the idea of maximiz- ing net benefits to society, how can you measure the costs and benefits of the project? how can you weigh a cheap, clean source of electricity against the damage to fish populations and the loss of rapids for rafting? how should you decide whether to build the dam or let the river run wild?
> a first step is to define the costs and benefits of each option.to com- pare these costs and benefits, you need to measure them on a common yardstick.then you can decide which option offers the greatest net ben- efit, although you may still want to ask why maximizing net benefits is what you should care about in the first place.
> this chapter tackles these issues.We start by considering how econo- mists think about the costs and benefits of environmental protection and how those might be measured. although determining costs is relatively straightforward, measuring benefits takes extra effort, as we shall see.We then consider how efficiency is implemented in practice, through benefit– cost analysis.that discussion culminates in an investigation into why ef- ficiency might (or might not) be a desirable goal for policy.

> is not simply the tuition plus the cost of room and board but also (and crucially) the forgone income from 2 or more years out of work. More broadly, the prices of inputs such as capital, labor, and materials reflect their values in alternative uses.to produce electricity requires capital to pay for the construction of the generating unit (money that could have gone into alternative investments), labor to operate the plant (workers who could earn wages in other jobs), and fuel to produce steam (fuel that could have been used by other companies and that required expending other resources in extraction and transportation).the same principle applies to reducing pollution: scrubbing sulfur dioxide out of flue gases requires capital to build the scrubber and labor and materials to operate it. devot- ing these resources to pollution control leaves less to spend on other op- portunities, such as improving the plant’s operation or increasing output.
> economics offers another valuable insight into the costs of environ- mental protection: they are ultimately borne by individuals, whether taxpayers, shareholders, or consumers. it is tempting to think that the benefits of clean air are enjoyed by society as a whole, whereas the costs of pollution control are paid out of corporate profits. in reality, of course, the costs of pollution control—even when they are “paid for” by corpo- rations or electric utilities—end up being borne largely by consumers of the goods and services that cause the pollution. For example, electric utili- ties typically recover much of the cost of pollution control by charging higher rates for electricity. even if abatement costs also reduce the utili- ties’ profits, much of that loss is felt by shareholders, who include retired pensioners as well as wealthy investors.
> several categories of costs are important in assessing environmental regulations: private compliance costs, government sector costs, social wel- fare costs, and transitional effects. What do these terms mean? Private compliance costs include most of the costs we have mentioned thus far in the book: capital costs for pollution control equipment and other in- frastructure required to comply with a new regulation, changes in inputs (such as a power plant’s increased costs of switching from high-sulfur to low-sulfur coal to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions or from coal to

> are reluctant to share it because it directly affects competitiveness. in a pinch, analysts can use published estimates of costs for standard technolo- gies and processes—the “engineering cost” approach.2
> outside of pollution control, the “compliance costs” analogous to abatement costs are often less obvious but no less important to consider. For example, let’s think about endangered species protection.the costs of protecting an endangered species might include money spent on preserv- ing habitat, enforcing prohibitions on hunting or poaching, and educating landowners and the public at large.as we saw in the example of the Cali- fornia condor in Chapter 2, some of these costs involve public expendi- tures—such as increased law enforcement—not just private expenditures, as for the pollution abatement compliance costs described earlier.these kinds of government expenditures make up the second category of regu- latory costs that must be included in weighing the costs of a regulation against its benefits. relevant government costs include those for training, monitoring and reporting, permitting, and litigation.
> the third category—social welfare costs—is more complicated.these costs are incurred when regulations increase the prices of goods and ser- vices in the regulated sector and beyond. if you have taken an introduc- tory microeconomics course, you will be used to thinking about these costs as changes in consumer and producer surplus. if not, just think about the ways in which regulating emissions from power plants might affect prices.When firms face higher production costs from switching fuels or removing constituents from their waste stream, they may raise electricity prices in response.3 this price increase hurts consumers; they must now pay more for each kilowatt of electricity they purchase than they paid be- fore the regulation, and this negative effect can be an important regulatory cost. in reaction to an electricity price increase, some consumers will pur- chase less electricity: they may change their behavior (turning down their thermostat in the winter, for example, and wearing a sweater indoors) or invest in energy efficiency measures that cut their electricity use.this substitution effect—spending less on electricity and more on sweaters or insulation—cushions consumers from the impact of the price change and thus dampens the social welfare costs of the regulation.that is, if we cal- culated the reduction in consumer surplus from the new power plant pol- lution regulation but failed to take into account how consumers would react to the increased price of electricity, we would overestimate the costs of the regulation.4 thus, the first step in estimating a regulation’s social welfare costs is to consider the impacts of any expected price increase for the regulated good or service on consumers, accounting for consumers’

>  Estimating the Costs of Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions
> In the mid-2000s, as global interest in climate change was increasing, the prominent consulting firm McKinsey & Company carried out analyses of the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, both at a global level and in specific countries. In preparing their studies, teams of consultants identified hundreds of potential abatement options across virtually every sector of the economy. For example, McKinsey’s analysis for the United States considered more than 250 options, including energy-efficient lighting and heating systems in residential and in commercial buildings, fuel economy standards for vari- ous classes of vehicles, changes in industrial processes, no-till agriculture, ac- tive forest management, solar and wind power, coal-to-gas switching at power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration at fossil-fired power plants.
> The consultants estimated the number of tons of emissions that could be reduced by each option, relative to an assumed “reference case” of what emis- sions would otherwise be in the year 2030. Drawing on assessments of current technology, assumptions about cost reductions and technological change, and projections of energy prices and other key parameters, McKinsey then esti- mated the cost of each option per ton of greenhouse gases abated in 2030. Finally, the options were arrayed from least to most cost to produce a marginal abatement cost curve (figure 3.1).5
> The right-hand part of the McKinsey cost curve looks much like the mar- ginal cost curves we discussed in Chapter 2: a range of options with increasing abatement costs. The left-hand part of the curve, on the other hand, lies below the horizontal axis, implying that the costs of abatement are negative.
> A number of observers pointed to this feature of the McKinsey curve as evidence that firms and consumers could save money by reducing emissions. Many economists were skeptical. They argued that firms and consumers would not systematically be “leaving money on the table.” Instead, they argued that McKinsey’s analysis failed to account for all the costs. For example, consumers might not install energy-efficient fluorescent lightbulbs, even though doing so would (according to McKinsey’s calculations) save them money, because they preferred the light from conventional incandescent ones. McKinsey, for its part, explained the “negative costs” by alluding to “market barriers.” (Recall our discussion of the “energy efficiency paradox” in Chapter 2.)
> McKinsey’s analysis is perhaps the best-known example of what econo- mists call a bottom-up cost model: To estimate the aggregate cost of reduc- ing emissions, they identified a range of concrete options and the cost and abatement potential of each one and added them up. Top-down models take the opposite approach. Rather than specify particular abatement options, they attempt to project how the economy would respond to a policy change. Instead

> of relying on estimates about costs and abatement potential of different tech- nologies, such models rely on estimates about key economic relationships. For example, data on energy prices and household energy use can be used to es- timate the elasticity of energy demand, which captures how sensitive changes in energy consumption are to changes in price. A top-down model uses the elasticity of energy demand to project how changes in energy prices resulting from a policy such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would translate into lower energy use and therefore lower emissions.6
> In both types of models, the role of assumptions—about “business-as- usual” emissions in the absence of policy, future energy prices, technological change, and so on—is critical. Different models (whether top-down or bottom- up) can produce widely divergent cost estimates. For that reason, a good rule is to look at a range of estimates of the costs of greenhouse gas mitigation rather than relying on a single model.

> analysis is needed to elucidate the potential spillover effects of the regula- tion in other sectors of the economy. Consider, again, what might hap- pen if a new air quality regulation increases production costs at a power plant. earlier we discussed the fact that the plant may raise electricity prices in response, causing changes in consumer behavior (and consumer and producer surplus) in the market for electricity. But higher electric- ity prices may also cause the owners of commercial office space to raise rents, universities to increase room and board fees for dormitories, and the manufacturers of energy-intensive consumer products (such as iPhones) to raise prices for those products. Firms that sell pollution control equip- ment may benefit from the regulation, because more power plants will purchase their products.a general equilibrium model captures these in- teractions between markets and measures a regulation’s aggregate effects on consumer and producer surplus in the economy.these extra costs and benefits may be very small, not even worth estimating, for regulations with minimal effects outside the regulated sector. in other cases, such as the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, the effects of which would ripple strongly through all kinds of product and service markets, general equilibrium models may be absolutely necessary to understanding a regu- lation’s costs.
> in our discussion about regulatory costs, you may have noticed an omission: as yet, we have said nothing about jobs. Political debates about environmental regulation are often dominated by competing views about the impact of such regulation on employment. opponents of regulation talk of “job-killing regulation.” supporters point to “green jobs.” how much of an impact do environmental regulations actually have on jobs?
> economic analysis suggests that the answer is “not much.”as a starting point, it is useful to note a few general reasons why we might not expect environmental regulations to have significant effects on jobs at a national level. in general, overall employment in the economy is determined by macroeconomic factors such as investment, labor supply, and technologi- cal progress. Under normal conditions, a job “lost” in one part of the national labor market is “gained” elsewhere. Moreover, the local and re- gional impacts of many government interventions—from environmental regulation to highway construction—are temporary.a burst in highway construction may create jobs only for a short period of time. Jobs lost when a factory closes may be made up when another moves to town. Quite apart from the impacts of government policies, the economy as a whole is remarkably dynamic. indeed, as much as one-fifth of jobs in the U.s. manufacturing sector are gained or lost each year.7

>  Valuing the Damages from Climate Change: The Social Cost of Carbon
> Climate change is a global phenomenon caused by emissions of tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases each year. The potential future damages from unchecked climate change are several percentage points of global economic output, amounting to trillions of dollars annually. Although these aggregate figures offer a compelling argument for taking action on cli- mate change, they provide little guidance in estimating or comparing the ben- efits achieved by particular regulations or in assessing the benefits and costs of more stringent policies.
> For those questions, we need a measure of the damages from much smaller changes in emissions. Consider the impacts of 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide. (For perspective, 1 ton of CO2 is roughly the same as the emissions per passen- ger on a full roundtrip flight from Washington, D.C., to Paris, or the emissions from a typical passenger vehicle in the United States over a 10-week period.) That ton will remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, on average, contributing ever so slightly to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and thus climate change. Consider the extra damages attributable to that ton over time: the cost of rising seas, extreme weather, drought, and wildfires; the dam- ages to public health from heat waves, exacerbated local air pollution, and the spread of malaria; the impacts on food production; the welfare change from hotter summers and warmer winters; the value of extinct species; and so on. Finally, discount that stream of damages back to the present.
> The result of that thought exercise is the social cost of carbon (SCC). In short, the SCC represents the present value of the marginal social damages from carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to the marginal social benefit from emissions abatement.
> As you might imagine, coming up with an estimate of the SCC is a chal- lenge.8 You won’t be surprised to learn that the choice of discount rate is cru- cial. As we saw in Chapter 2, seemingly small differences in discount rates can cause the present value of distant costs and benefits to vary by two or three orders of magnitude.
> Other challenges lurk in the models used to estimate damages (called integrated assessment models [IAMs] because they integrate models of the climate system with models of the economy to assess the potential damages from climate change under various emission scenarios). A key issue is specify- ing the “damage function” that relates the rise in global average temperatures to aggregate damages. For small temperature increases, on the order of 1°C to 3°C, researchers may be able to come up with reasonable estimates (based on observations of how actual variation in temperatures affects crop yields, say, or

> human health). Because unchecked climate change could raise temperatures well beyond that point, climate modelers must make strong assumptions about the damages from even higher temperatures. Similarly, it is difficult to incorporate the impact of unlikely but potentially catastrophic events, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet or the reversal of the North Atlan- tic ocean currents that keep northern Europe habitable. Nonetheless, despite their flaws, the comprehensive approach taken by IAMs makes them a valuable tool to inform our thinking about the economic impacts of climate change.
> In 2009, the Obama administration set out to establish a common value for the SCC to use in analyzing the impact of proposed regulations. (Up to that point, different agencies used different values for the SCC or didn’t use one at all; indeed, no U.S. government agency included the SCC in regulatory impact analysis before 2008.) Meeting over the course of several months, a group of analysts from various White House offices, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and other government agencies agreed on a set of assumptions (such as future emissions and economic growth scenar- ios, values of key parameters relating emissions to temperature increases, and discount rates). These assumptions were used as inputs into the three most commonly cited IAMs, which were run hundreds of thousands of times, result- ing in different distributions of SCC estimates. The results were published in 2010 and then updated (using the same assumptions but revised versions of the three IAMs) in 2013.9
> Figure 3.2 illustrates the results for the year 2020. (The SCC rises over time in real terms, because future emissions will impose greater costs on the margin; recall from our discussion in Chapter 2 that the damages from pollu- tion typically rise more and more rapidly as pollution increases.) Results are shown separately for each of the three discount rates considered: 2.5, 3, and 5 percent. The results are shown as distributions of the SCC, because different model runs rely on different assumptions about parameters. (For example, a model run that assumed rapid emission growth and a high climate sensitivity would yield greater future damages and thus a higher SCC than a model run with slow emission growth and lower climate sensitivity.) The height of each bar is the fraction of model runs that yielded a particular value for the SCC. For example, using a 3 percent discount rate, the estimated SCC was around $20 per ton in just over 10 percent of the model runs. The figure also highlights the average estimates across all model runs, for each discount rate.
> These distributions, especially at the lower discount rates, have a distinc- tive feature: They have a long right-hand “tail.” Intuitively, there is a small but nonzero probability that damages from CO2 emissions are much higher than

> the average value. Given a 3 percent discount rate, for example, the average SCC estimate was $43 in 2007 dollars, but roughly 10 percent of the model runs yielded an SCC of $60 or greater (corresponding to the sum of the areas of the bars at or above $60). One way of capturing this “tail effect” is to calculate the 95th percentile value of a distribution, the value that is greater than 95 percent of the model runs for a given discount rate. As the figure shows, the 95th per- centile SCC for a 3 percent discount rate is $129/ton.
> For the purposes of regulatory analysis, the working group recommended using the four estimates highlighted in the figure, corresponding to the three average values plus the 95th percentile under a 3 percent discount rate. These values are now used by agencies across the U.S. government in assessing the benefits and costs of policies that are expected to reduce CO2 emissions, in- cluding fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, energy efficiency stan- dards for appliances, and emission standards for power plants.

>  if job impacts at the level of the economy as a whole are small, what about those in regulated industries? From a theoretical point of view, the effect of environmental regulation on employment in the regulated industry could be either positive or negative, because competing effects push in different ways. some of the money firms spend to comply on regulation will be spent on labor (a positive effect on jobs); some of the

> 44 markets and the environment
> cost of compliance will be passed on to the firm’s consumers in the form of higher prices, reducing demand for output (a negative effect); and regu- lation may lead firms to use more or less labor relative to other inputs such as energy and capital (an ambiguous effect).
> Meanwhile, empirical studies have generally failed to find a significant effect. For example, pollution expenditures in four U.s. manufacturing in- dustries are not associated with significant long-run employment changes, and there is no evidence of long-run adverse effects of environmental regulation on employment in the United kingdom. similarly, environ- mental regulations do not appear to be a major driver of decisions about where to locate manufacturing plants; we discuss this issue further in Chapter 11, when we discuss interactions between trade and environ- mental regulation.10
> of course, even job impacts that are transitory and limited from a national perspective can be keenly felt by affected workers. one analysis estimated that workers in manufacturing plants newly regulated under the 1990 Clean air act amendments experienced more than $5 billion in forgone earnings in subsequent years, because of temporary unemploy- ment and lower wages in later jobs.11 these costs were temporary and very small relative to the human health and other benefits of the amend- ments. But such transitional employment impacts can play an outsized role in national debates over environmental regulation.
> this example suggests a broader conclusion.the impacts of environ- mental regulation on employment (whether positive or negative) should indeed be considered in economic analyses of environmental regulations. But on the basis of the available evidence, those impacts are likely to be transitory and small relative to the other costs and benefits of regulation.12
> Evaluating the Benefits
> Before we think about how to measure benefits, we must first think about how to define them. Let’s start with an example. suppose a parcel of open space near where you live—a wetland or a woodland or a beachfront site—is up for sale and likely to be converted into a housing develop- ment. how would you think about your own value for preserving the open space? it might seem self-evident that the value from open space is higher than the value from development. But of course that might not be so obvious to the developer, or the people who would like to buy houses in the new development, or other residents of the town who care less about the open space than the influx of new residents and the addition to the tax base. indeed, your own house might once have been part of
> 
> the benefits and costs of environmental protection 45
> a new development on what used to be open space. in order to balance the views of people who favor preserving the open space against those in favor of development, we need to have some way of thinking about the benefits from preservation.
> how, then, should we think about benefits? From an economic point of view, a person’s value for a particular good can be determined by what he or she would willingly give up in exchange. economists call this mea- sure of benefits willingness to pay. it captures the basic truth that in a world of limited resources, we always have to give up a good thing in order to get another good thing. (We’ll come back to this point again when we discuss the rationale behind benefit–cost analysis.) Put differently, if you are not willing to give up anything to preserve the open space, then we might reasonably conclude that your value for it is zero.
> although this is a straightforward way of defining value, several impor- tant points should be made. First, by someone’s “willingness to pay” we mean the amount that the person would just barely be willing to pay. if my willingness to pay to preserve a parcel of open space is $100, it means i would be just as happy if i paid $100 and the open space was preserved as if i paid nothing and the open space was developed. in this sense, willing- ness to pay really measures the maximum a person would be willing to pay.
> second, nothing in this concept requires that any payment actually be made. My willingness to pay exists as a measure of value, independently of whether i actually write a check for $100 or not.We are concerned here with willingness to pay “in one’s heart of hearts,” so to speak.
> third, this concept of value is unabashedly anthropocentric, or human centered. to economists, the value of anything depends on the satisfac- tion (or “happiness” or “utility”) that humans derive from it. note that this is not the same thing as saying that only “useful” things have value. on the contrary, the economic notion of willingness to pay is as expan- sive as people’s imaginations. a value for open space or biodiversity or endangered species is perfectly consistent with it, because humans have shown (through their actions) that they are willing to sacrifice much to preserve them.
> Fourth, in addition to being hu- man centered, the economic notion of value centers on the preferences of the individual rather than of the group. economic analysis emphasizes the values and preferences of individ- uals as they perceive them. one might
> A person’s value for a particular good can be determined by what he or she would willingly give up in exchange. Economists call this measure of benefits willingness to pay.
>   
> 46 markets and the environment
> say that value is in the eye of the beholder. economic theory is rigorously neutral with respect to what people decide is valuable to them. Most people tend to think of one set of preferences as “right” or “superior” because it seems obvious to them. For example, it might be tempting to think that everyone ought to conserve water or gasoline as much as pos- sible. But from the viewpoint of economics, we must consider the prefer- ences of those who would rather keep an enormous lawn green or drive a gas guzzler.this does not mean that people who prefer to drive hummers rather than Priuses should not bear the consequences of the extra carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate matter they emit. to the contrary, as we shall see in Chapter 5, economics prescribes that people and firms pay the full costs to society for their actions. however, the individualistic perspective of economics does hold that people should ultimately be al- lowed to make their own decisions about what they value and what they do not.
> a drawback of this approach is that it does not necessarily take account of how well informed people are about the environment. For example, if people do not understand the ecosystem services that wetlands provide (e.g., flood control, habitat, and water quality), they may place less value on those resources than they would if they knew more. a natural solu- tion is to educate people about the benefits of environmental protection. For example, when economists conducted surveys in the aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William sound, they took care to provide some background information on the spill and its likely envi- ronmental effects before asking people to estimate the damages from the spill (we’ll discuss this particular valuation exercise later in the chapter).
> Fifth,a subtle but potentially crucial distinction arises between willing- ness to pay (WtP) and willingness to accept (Wta).the difference between the two hinges on the implicit assignment of property rights. if i ask you what you are willing to pay to preserve open space from development, i implicitly assign a property right to the developer. if, instead, i ask what you are willing to accept from the developer in compensation for develop- ing the very same parcel of land, i have given you the implicit property right. in practice, these implicit property rights are often determined by the status quo. For example, if we contemplate a prospective action that has not yet taken place (“should we as a society allow oil drilling in the arctic national Wildlife refuge?”), then we might naturally consider society’s willingness to accept compensation for loss of the wilderness area. on the other hand, in the aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez ac- cident or the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
> 
> the benefits and costs of environmental protection 47
> the relevant issue for valuation was society’s willingness to pay to clean up the spill. a related way of stating the distinction is that Wta is a natural measure for your losses, whereas WtP corresponds more readily to gains.
> in many cases,WtP and Wta should coincide, at least if we can mea- sure them accurately (i.e., if we can set aside reasons why people might intentionally understate their WtP or overstate their Wta). For example, suppose you head to Fenway Park in Boston to see the red sox play a baseball game. Let’s assume you would be willing to pay up to (but no more than) $50 for a grandstand ticket. if you show up on the day of the game without a ticket and find someone willing to sell you one for $50 or less, you will buy it. on the other hand, if you already have a ticket, and someone offers you $50 or more for it, you will sell. if you were not willing to pay $80 to buy a ticket, you will not be willing to forgo $80 if you can sell it for that much.
> as the stakes get larger and larger, however, a gap may open up be- tween what you would be willing to pay and what you would be willing to accept.this is simply because willingness to pay depends in part on ability to pay. to see this, consider the Great Barrier reef in australia, which is threatened by the rising ocean temperatures associated with global climate change. how much you would be willing to pay to prevent the reef from being destroyed? although the amount might be large, it is constrained by your need to have money to buy other goods and ulti- mately by your wealth. now consider how much you would be willing to accept to allow the reef to be destroyed.Your answer now might well be “infinity,” or equivalently “no amount of money.” in that case Wta far exceeds WtP. But it helps illustrate an important point.Wta will always be at least as large as WtP. the two measures may diverge considerably, however, when large income effects are involved. keeping this relation- ship between WtP and Wta in mind, we will refer to WtP rather than Wta when we consider the benefits of environmental protection.
> Finally,the use ofWtP as a measure of value is not confined to environ- mental goods: on the contrary, the concept is fundamental to economic theory.the same principle applies to shoes or coffee or automobiles as to open space:the benefits you derive from a particular good can be measured by what you would be willing to give up for it. of course, in a market setting what you would be willing to give up for something can be inferred from your purchase decisions. if you pass up a pair of shoes when they cost $100 but buy them on sale for $80, then i can infer that the value you place on the shoes is between $80 and $100. in contrast, no such observable data exist for most environmental amenities. indeed,
> 
> 48 markets and the environment
> as we shall see later, the main practical hurdle to valuing environmental goods is that clean air, endangered species, open space preservation, and other environmental amenities are not traded in markets.
> A Taxonomy of Values
> defining the benefits of environmental quality in terms of willingness to pay still leaves us with a range of kinds of values—that is, reasons people might be willing to pay. Let’s return to the example of open space pres- ervation. some people would be willing to pay for open space because they are eager to visit it—to take walks in the woods or look for birds in a wetland. other people without current plans to visit the area might nonetheless be willing to pay something to preserve it now, in order to have the option to use it in the future. still others might not plan on using it themselves but would want to preserve it to pass on to their children or grandchildren. Finally, some people might be willing to pay something to preserve a parcel of open space simply because they take pleasure in knowing that it exists.
> as the example makes clear, we can identify several distinct types of value.today’s visitors value open space because they will use it for recre- ation, and prospective visitors want to preserve the option of using it in the future. Both of those values fall under the heading of use value. Use values involve direct enjoyment or consumption of an environmental good. For another example, consider the gains from reducing smog in Los angeles.the benefits range from attenuated adverse health effects (eye irritation, asthma, difficulties breathing) to aesthetic values (better views from homes high in the canyons or hiking trails in the mountains nearby). Both the health effects and the aesthetic values constitute use values, be- cause they represent direct consumption or enjoyment of the cleaner air. Use values also arise from recreation—as for water quality in trout streams or at the beach or water volume in river rapids enjoyed by rafters.
> the other two types of value mentioned earlier—the desire to pre- serve a resource for future generations and the pleasure taken from the knowledge that something exists—are, naturally enough, called nonuse values.they involve benefits derived from the existence of an environ- mental amenity but not from its direct use. existence value is of particular importance for endangered species preservation in the real world: how many donors to wildlife conservation societies actually believe they will see a Bengal tiger or a polar bear? rather, much of the value of endan- gered species or habitats is simply knowing that they are there.

> the benefits and costs of environmental protection 49 Measuring Benefits
> to apply these concepts, of course—and to carry out benefit–cost analy- sis—we must be able to measure how much people are actually willing to pay for a given environmental amenity.an in-depth discussion of valua- tion methods is beyond the scope of this book. however, we can sketch out the basic intuition behind the major approaches.
> For most consumer goods, measuring benefits is straightforward. to determine how much consumers are willing to pay for dress shirts, or iPhones, or home appliances, analysts can gather market data on the prices of goods and the quantities purchased. in the environmental realm, this is possible for some goods and services. For example, the impacts of water pollution abatement on the local commercial fish catch can be valued us- ing market prices and quantities, as can the impacts of reducing acid rain on commercial timber harvests.this conceptually simple approach does not work for most aspects of environmental quality, however, because most environmental goods and services are not traded in markets.
> economists have developed two basic strategies to circumvent this lack of price and quantity data in order to estimate the value of environmental amenities.the first approach is to observe behavior indirectly, in related markets, and use that information to infer willingness to pay for environ- mental quality. economists call this the revealed preference approach, be- cause it treats actual behavior as revealing the true underlying preferences of individuals.the second basic approach to estimating value is simply to ask people how much they would be willing to pay to protect a given en- vironmental resource (e.g., an area of habitat, a population of endangered species).this is the stated preference approach.We describe several revealed preference methods, and one stated preference method, in the next two sections. For reasons we describe later, economists tend to favor revealed preference methods, although for some values stated preference methods are the only alternative.
> Revealed Preference Methods for Estimating the Value of Environmental Quality
> one revealed preference method, the travel cost method, infers individual marginal willingness to pay for environmental quality from decisions about where to travel for recreation.13 although many national parks and other major natural resource recreation sites have an entrance fee, that fee is often a very small component of the total cost of a visit; you
> 
> 50 markets and the environment
> would spend much more on an airline ticket or a road trip to Yellow- stone national Park than you would to gain entry to the park itself.the travel cost method statistically exploits the relationship between travel cost and visitation rates, permitting the estimation of a demand function for recreation. if the economic value of recreation at a site depends on site characteristics, then multiple-site models can be used to value those characteristics. For example, if we observe an angler traveling to a remote fishing lake, we can infer that he values the experience of fishing there at least as much as the trip’s cost (in time as well as money). By comparing the frequency and duration of anglers’ visits to pristine lakes with those to more polluted ones, one can estimate the marginal benefits of clean water to recreational fishers.travel cost models are among the most widely ap- plied valuation methods and have become a very useful tool for estimat- ing recreational demand.
> another revealed preference method uses observed market prices to infer the implicit prices for environmental amenities that are bundled with other (private) goods.a common application is to housing markets. Con- sider the following thought experiment: imagine two houses located in the same metropolitan area that are identical in every respect, except that one of the houses is in a neighborhood with poorer air quality.the house with cleaner air will command a higher price, with the size of the pre- mium being determined by the difference in air quality and by people’s marginal willingness to pay for clean air. in effect, the housing market does set a price on, or capitalize the value of, clean air.
> of course, in the real world houses are never identical on every dimen- sion except for air quality: one is located on a bigger lot and in a better school system, and the other house has a shorter commute and is close to a city park. instead of being directly observable, the price of clean air in the housing market must be teased out from other attributes. dealing with these other factors, however, is a methodological rather than a conceptual challenge, and sophisticated statistical techniques have been developed to isolate the effect of air quality from other (potentially correlated) fac- tors.thus the hedonic property method, as it is called, has been used widely to estimate marginal willingness to pay for reductions in a variety of air pollutants and for other local environmental amenities and disamenities, such as toxic waste sites. For example, a recent study demonstrates that proximity to natural gas wells in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale region increases home values, perhaps because of actual or expected benefits from mineral royalty payments. But homes that obtain their drinking water from their own private groundwater wells, rather than municipal

> piped water, experience decreases in property values of 10 to 22 percent when near shale gas wells, suggesting that local housing markets capitalize the potential risks to groundwater associated with energy development.14
> a similar method can be applied to labor markets. observed wages vary with the amount of education, training, and expertise needed to per- form a job well, the cost of living and desirability of the job location, and other factors. one of those other factors is a job’s embodied risks to life and health. economists apply the hedonic wage method to estimate the wage premium workers receive for accepting a high-risk job.the estimated values of these small changes in risks to life and health in job settings are used frequently in benefit–cost analysis of environmental regulations to monetize the value of avoided premature deaths and avoided illness from exposure to pollution. For example, one might observe that workers ap- pear to be willing to give up $14 in annual wages to reduce the risk of dying on the job from 1 in 400,000 to 1 in 500,000 (a reduction in the probability of death of 0.000002).these marginal valuations can be used directly to estimate the benefits of an air pollution reduction resulting in similarly small changes in risk for the exposed population as a whole. in many cases, regulatory agencies go one step further, linearly extrapolating from these values the value of a single (statistically) avoided premature death from pollution exposure.this value has come to be known as the value of a statistical life (vsL). For example, if we make the following calculation from the change in occupational risk discussed earlier, the marginal willingness to pay for risk reduction divided by the marginal change in risk is $14/0.000002. if we set this fraction equal to the mar- ginal willingness to pay for a change in the risk of dying from 1 to 0, then $14/0.000002 = $X/1.0.thevsL is the numerator of the right-side frac- tion ($X), $14/0.000002, or $7 million.
> this ($7 million) is, in fact, approximately the vsL currently used by the environmental Protection agency (ePa) in benefit–cost analyses of pollution control regulations that reduce the risk of premature death from pollution exposure; it is the average value obtained from twenty-one dif- ferent hedonic wage studies and five stated preference studies (more on these later) that estimate the value of risk reductions.avsL of $7 million does not imply that an individual would be willing to pay $7 million to avoid certain death this year. it does imply that those exposed to a 1 in 400,000 risk of dying would pay about $14 to reduce that risk to 1 in 500,000, or for that matter, that those exposed to a 1 in 10,000 risk of death would pay about $700 to eliminate that risk (because $700/0.0001 = $7 million). it is not the “value of a life” in either economic or ethical

> 52 markets and the environment
> terms, although it is often a lightning rod for controversy among those who misunderstand the concept or simply oppose its use in the design of environmental policy.
> assigning monetary value to avoided death and illness makes some people uncomfortable. a key thing to take away from this discussion, however, is that spending public and private funds on pollution control regulation, and risk mitigation more broadly, involves tradeoffs.and these tradeoffs are either made implicitly, and can then be quantified ex post, or made explicitly ex ante using benefit–cost analysis. avoiding monetiza- tion of risks to life and health does not erase the tradeoffs that are made when standards are set.
> the travel cost method and hedonic property and wage methods of environmental benefit valuation are all revealed preference methods in that they estimate willingness to pay from actual market transactions. even though there are not markets for clean air, peoples’ willingness to pay for clean air leaves footprints in housing markets and labor markets; we can exploit this information to estimate the implicit value of nonmarket environmental goods. similarly, even though park entrance fees do not capture visitors’ willingness to pay for outdoor recreation, visitors’ travel expenditures give us some information to estimate these values. however, some of the values discussed in the introduction to this section—the value of simply knowing that the arctic national Wildlife refuge remains pris- tine or knowing that the giant panda and the polar bear exist—leave no footprints in markets.to estimate these kinds of values, stated preference methods are needed.
> Stated Preference Methods for Estimating the Value of Environmental Quality
> the stated preference approach consists of several methods, although the most common method is contingent valuation (Cv). Cv is conceptually straightforward: Carefully structured surveys are administered to a group of people to obtain information on their willingness to pay.the great advantage of this approach is its broad applicability. revealed preference methods, by their very nature, can be applied only to estimate use values. existence value is purely internal rather than behavioral: it leaves behind no “paper trail” of observed behavior that can be used to infer someone’s value for a resource. in contrast, Cv can in principle be used to measure willingness to pay for any good, simply by asking people.
> of course, this broad applicability does not come cheap.the disadvan- tage of Cv methods is that the respondents lack strong incentives to tell the truth. if they feel they have little stake in the outcome—thinking, for
> 
> the benefits and costs of environmental protection 53
> example,“this is just a survey”—then they may have little reason to think carefully about their choice and provide a thoughtful response. things may be even worse if respondents believe that their answers to the survey will affect policy,because in that case they may have strategic incentives to misrepresent their true valuations. For example, suppose i have a moder- ate willingness to pay for clean air, and i live in an area with a large popu- lation. if i think that i will be asked to pay a tax on gasoline or electricity (to finance pollution control) based on how i respond to a Cv survey, i will have an incentive to understate my true valuation, in the hopes of “free riding” off of the contributions of others. after all, i might reason, my own tax payment is likely to have very little effect on air pollution, but i would be much better off personally if that tax payment were as small as possible. on the other hand, if i believe that my preferences for clean air will help secure strong regulation but that i will not be asked to pay on the basis of my response, then i may well overstate my willingness to pay, in the knowledge that the cost of clean air will be borne largely by others.15
> economists who specialize in Cv have devised a number of approaches to mitigate these and other potential sources of bias. as a result, a range of meta-analyses that have compiled results from multiple studies have con- cluded that Cv methods and revealed preference approaches yield similar estimates of willingness to pay for environmental amenities whose value can be assessed using either method.this is taken as evidence in support of these methods. of course, because revealed preference methods can- not be used to estimate nonuse or existence value, Cv estimates of these values cannot be similarly calibrated. in addition, estimates produced by Cv are generally much more variable across studies. economists tend to put greater trust in the revealed preference approaches, just as you might wisely attach more weight to what another person actually does rather than what he or she says. nonetheless, Cv remains invaluable for its abil- ity to provide estimates of existence value.the method has been used in high-profile cases of natural resource damage assessment, to estimate lost passive use (or nonuse) values from oil spills and other environmental harms.
> Both the revealed preference and stated preference approaches to es- timating the value of environmental amenities tend to focus on marginal willingness to pay. studies that infer value from behavior (such as the hedonic property studies) necessarily focus on marginal willingness to pay, because that is what can be observed directly.the price of clean air is essentially a measure of what people are willing to pay for an incremental improvement in air quality, just as the price of an iPhone is the price of

>  Contingent Valuation and Natural Resource Damage Assessment
> In March 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound off the coast of Alaska with 50 million gallons of crude oil in the hold. To that date, it was the largest tanker spill in U.S. history; 11 million gal- lons spilled in less than 5 hours. By August, the oil slick from the spill covered 10,000 square miles in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. Known en- vironmental impacts included the deaths of hundreds of thousands of seabirds, thousands of sea otters, hundreds of bald eagles, and many orcas. Following a 1989 U.S. federal court opinion allowing compensation for lost “passive use” (or nonuse) values under U.S. environmental statutes, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 stated that these values could be included in natural resource damage as- sessment, the practice used to support litigation on behalf of entities seeking compensation from those found responsible for environmental harms.
> When the State of Alaska took Exxon to court over the incident, it hired a team of economists to estimate the nonuse damages from the spill using contingent valuation. Nonuse value was potentially important, because many Americans may have experienced damages from the spill, knowing that a pris- tine area that was home to many charismatic species had been harmed. Exxon hired its own team of economists to highlight the weaknesses of CV methods and thus cast doubt on Alaska’s damage estimates.16 The team working on be- half of Alaska estimated total nonuse damages (to all U.S. citizens) from the spill of about $2.8 billion. This estimate was over and above any losses in use value, such as damages to commercial and recreational fishing and tourism (and was, in fact, many times larger than these estimated losses). After lengthy litigation, Exxon agreed to pay about $1 billion in damages; it also spent $2 billion of its own funds on response and restoration. Some have pointed out that the magnitude of estimated damages is approximately equal to the sum of Exxon’s settlement and restoration expenditures.
> Although court cases since the Exxon incident have continued to reinforce the validity of CV in litigation over natural resource damages under the Oil Pol- lution Act, CERCLA (or Superfund), and the Clean Water Act, it has been used infrequently in this context. One additional application of CV supported claims by the federal government of long-term damages to birds and fish caused by exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and DDT, deposited off the southern California coast for many decades by seven firms. After the Deepwater Hori- zon accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history (involving almost twenty times the amount of oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez), no comprehensive CV analysis was done to estimate nonuse damages. The incident did prompt renewed debate about the validity of CV, however.17 In the 21 years between the Exxon and Deepwater Horizon spills, thousands of academic articles and books were published on this method of estimating non- use values, but the role of CV in litigation and public policy decisions remains controversial.

> a single iPhone. Cv studies also tend to focus on marginal willingness to pay, in large part because policy decisions tend to be made on the margin. that is, the relevant question for pollution control policy is not “should we reduce air pollution?” but rather “should we reduce pollution by 8 million tons a year or by 10 million tons?” similarly, debates over endan- gered species laws focus on the level of protection that should be provided rather than on whether endangered species should be protected at all.
