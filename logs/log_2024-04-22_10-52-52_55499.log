> Can you construct a mapping from each of the CV disciplines to one of the disciplines on the survey of earned doctorates?
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can help with that. I'll do my best in mapping but please note that the mapping may not be perfect due to the differences in discipline naming across different academic spheres. Some disciplines may fall under multiple categories, and some may not have a perfect match.
