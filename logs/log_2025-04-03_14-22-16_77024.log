> Dear Mr. Diouf,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in pursuing a PhD in "Sustainable Fisheries Management." It is an important and impactful field, and your experience at the Directorate of Maritime Fisheries and as the National Focal Point for the EAF-NANSEN Programme highlights a strong foundation for this endeavor.
> 
> I would be pleased to discuss your aspirations and how I might assist you in this journey. Unfortunately, all funding for admissions in 2025 has already been allocated, and the main constraint we are facing is indeed related to funding availability, particularly due to recent changes in the US.
> 
> I encourage you to cast a wide net in your search for opportunities, seeking potential scholarships and funding from various sources. If you would like to discuss this further, please feel free to schedule a time for us to chat via Zoom by using my scheduling link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).

> I look forward to our conversation and exploring potential pathways for your PhD aspirations.
