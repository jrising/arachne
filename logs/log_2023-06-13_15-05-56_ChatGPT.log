> For a conflict of interest statement, I am asked "To the best of your knowledge and belief, is there any connection between the subject report or topic and any of your, and/or your spouseâ€™s, compensated or uncompensated employment, including government service, during the past 24 months?"
> I am a researcher on climate change, and the project would be to review a report on climate change impacts in another state. Do I need to say yes to this?
**assistant**:
> The conflict of interest statement is asking if your employment or any other compensated or uncompensated activities might reasonably appear to affect the objectivity of your review of the report. This includes any potential benefit you or your spouse might receive from the outcomes of your review, and any personal or professional relationships you might have with parties who are affected by the report.
> 
> If your work as a climate change researcher is directly related to the subject matter of the report you are reviewing, this might reasonably be seen as a potential conflict of interest. However, it doesn't necessarily mean there is an actual conflict of interest, only that there might be a perceived one. 
> 
> For example, if your research is about the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Arizona and the report you're reviewing is about climate change impacts on agriculture in Florida, there may be little direct overlap. Still, because the general topic of climate change is consistent, it might be seen as a potential conflict.
> 
> The key here is to fully disclose all potentially relevant information. You should indicate that you are a climate change researcher, but also provide context about your specific area of focus. 
> 
> It will be up to the party requesting the conflict of interest statement to decide whether your involvement constitutes a conflict. It's important to be as transparent as possible in these situations, as the failure to disclose a potential conflict could have serious repercussions.
