> The document is a research paper on climate change risk assessment, published in September 2021 by the Environment and Society Programme. It emphasizes the increasing risks and potential devastating impacts if immediate action is not taken. The authors include Daniel Quiggin, Kris De Meyer, Lucy Hubble-Rose, and Antony Froggatt. Accompanying the text is an image showing a flood at a hospital's outpatient department, indicating a medical emergency response with rescue personnel evacuating people using inflatable boats amid the rising waters.

> The summary identifies potential future climate scenarios based on current emission trends and the commitments of countries under the Paris Agreement. If current low-carbon practices continue, warming might reach 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, with a worst-case scenario of 3.5 degrees Celsius. However, any complacency could risk warming up to 7 degrees Celsius. Current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are insufficient to meet the targeted limits of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. Although there is a global focus on net zero pledges, these lack concrete policy frameworks and action plans. Without significant enhancements to NDCs and a rapid transition to low-carbon technologies, severe and unmanageable climate impacts will likely become entrenched by 2040. This includes extreme heatwaves affecting billions, declines in agricultural yields, and increased global cropland droughts. Rapid policy improvements and investment in low-carbon technology could mitigate these outcomes.

> The page discusses significant climate change impacts expected by the 2040s and 2050s. The main points include potential yield losses in major maize-producing countries and threats to global wheat and rice production due to damaging hot spells. By 2050, cropland used for these grains could suffer from reduced crop duration, leading to decreased yields. The document also predicts that nearly 700 million people could face prolonged droughts annually by 2040, with East and South Asia and Africa being severely affected. These climate impacts could result in increased mortality, political instability, and potential conflicts by creating a cycle of food insecurity, migration, and infectious diseases.

> The introduction highlights the urgency of addressing climate risks, which are escalating and may become unmanageable for many nations by 2040. It emphasizes the importance of the upcoming COP26 conference in 2021, where countries are revising their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Current NDCs are inadequate for limiting temperature increases to the targets of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. The paper stresses the need for enhanced commitments, swift policy implementation, and large-scale investment in low-carbon technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed global interdependencies, underscoring the necessity for collaborative efforts in climate action.

> The page emphasizes the importance of assessing both high-probability, high-impact and low-probability, high-impact climate risks. These risks can escalate from minor concerns in the short term to overwhelming issues in the medium to long term. Assessments help decision-makers allocate resources effectively to address these growing challenges. The document also highlights the systemic, cascading nature of climate risks that emerge from complex interdependent systems. The paper builds upon previous research phases and maintains a clear separation between assessing risks and recommending mitigation strategies.

> Global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are dangerously off track. Current NDCs indicate a one percent reduction in emissions globally by two thousand thirty, compared with two thousand ten levels. Most countries are currently focusing on net zero pledges, with an implicit assumption that these targets will avert climate change. However, net zero pledges lack policy detail and delivery mechanisms, and the deficit between targets and the global carbon budget is widening every year.

> The global long-term average surface temperature and changes in climatic conditions are dependent on cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. As such, climate change risks are contingent on the emissions trajectory that the global community is likely to follow. Given that around two-thirds of global carbon dioxide equivalent emissions originate from the energy sector, the decarbonization of the energy sector will be a primary determinant of future emissions, and thus of the risks posed by emissions. The term emissions risk reflects the chance that the world is on a high emissions trajectory that will further increase the climate risks and their impacts on global and regional populations.
