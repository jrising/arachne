>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)

>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
>    or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> My name is Maryam Saadatmand. I successfully completed my master’s degree in Environmental Science. I ranked 2nd among undergraduate students in this field. My GPA during M.Sc was 18.81/20(4/4) and during B.Sc was 18.43/20(3.8/4). Besides, I have contributed to two published international academic papers and one pending manuscript in my field. Additionally, I have been working as an HSE supervisor at a port for about ten years.
> 
> I have the expertise and a keen interest in GIS, Heavy Metal Contamination, Risk Assessment, Climate Change, and Environmental Pollution. Furthermore, I am passionate about working on new ideas and skills to combine them with my prior knowledge. I also visited your webpage and explored your recent works and articles. Your research areas are quite interesting to me and very close to my research experiences and interests.
> 
> For further information, my CV is attached, or you can kindly view my LinkedIn/ResearchGate account.
> 
> Please let me know whether I am eligible to pursue my education toward a Ph.D. degree under your supervision.

> I really appreciate your time, and I am looking forward to your kind reply.

> Dear James,
> 
> The email is from Maryam Saadatmand who expresses her interest in pursuing a Ph.D. under your supervision. She holds a master’s degree in Environmental Science, ranking high among her peers. She has also contributed to research works published and has substantial work experience.
> 
> Her areas of expertise and interest – GIS, Heavy Metal Contamination, Risk Assessment, Climate Change, and Environmental Pollution – seem to align well with your research interests, particularly climate change risks. You might want to assess how these could fit with interdisciplinary quantitative modeling or food systems studies.
> 
> Maryam did not specify the exact academic program she's interested in. Therefore, it is somewhat ambiguous. Based on her interest in the environment, experience with GIS and climate change, and your research, she may be a good candidate for either the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics or Ph.D. in Marine Policy, both of which have an interdisciplinary approach.
> 
> In terms of her location and educational background, she doesn't mention whether she is near Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area or has attended MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD.

> Given her background and interests, along with the above information, here's a proposed response:

> Dear Maryam,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Considering your strong background in Environmental Science and related research experiences, you might be a good candidate for our Ph.D. programs in Environmental Economics or Marine Policy, both of which have an interdisciplinary focus that seems to align with your research interests.
> 
> However, funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to mention my name in your statement of purpose so that your application can be considered for any available funds related to my area of research. This best applies if you are exploring themes around climate change risks, food systems, or interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
> 
> Please consider applying by the end of this calendar year so that you can be fully reviewed for funding opportunities.
