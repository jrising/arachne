> Using dplyr, I am combining up rows in a dataframe. The attributes for all of the rows I am combining are the same, so I just want to grab one value from each of the grouped rows. However, I want to do this for every attribute, and I have a few dozen columns. Is there a way to do this without naming each column?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, you can use the summarize_all() function from the `dplyr` package in R. This function applies the same function (e.g., first, mean, sum, etc.) to all columns in your data frame. Here's an example:
> 
> ```R
> library(dplyr)
> 
> # Assuming `df` is your data frame and `grouping_column` is the column you want to group by.
> 
> new_df <- df %>% 
>   group_by(grouping_column) %>% 
>   summarise_all(.funs = first)
> ```
> 
> This example groups by a column named "grouping_column" and then applies the `first` function to every column, reducing each group to a single row comprised of the first non-NA value in each column for that group. Replace `first` with the function that suits your need.
> 
> In case if you want to consider the first value even if it's `NA` then you can make use of `na.rm = FALSE`.
> 
> ```R
> new_df <- df %>% 
>   group_by(grouping_column) %>% 
>   summarise_all(first, na.rm = FALSE)
> ```
