> ---
> My research program is centered around the quantitative, interdisciplinary study of climate impacts and the water-energy-food system. Broadly, my research provides new insight into how we can better manage complex, social-environmental systems under global environmental change. By better understanding coupled human-natural systems, my work can help researchers and policy-makers develop detailed transition pathways that ensure economic and environmental sustainability.

> \subsection*{Interdisciplinarity in climate risks}
> 
> An integral component of my research is the bridging of gaps that exist between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics to study the economic risks of climate change. This work requires both methodological innovations and improved collaborative practices. I worked to narrow the gap between these fields through grant-funded workshops and

> \cite{piontek2021integrated, rising2022challenges, rising2022missing}. All of these papers have explicitly synthesized perspectives from natural science, process-based modeling, and economics, opening new research opportunities which provide fertile ground for recent and future work.
> 
> I have a long-running collaboration under the Climate Impact Lab (CIL, \url{https://impactlab.org/}), which is charting one interdisciplinary path to quantify climate risks. I developed the analytical engine behind the influential American Climate Prospectus (ACP) \cite{hsiang2017estimating}, and have since developed ground-breaking new approaches for handling heterogeneity in climate vulnerability and the quantification of adaptation costs, across multiple sectors (health, energy, agriculture and labor productivity)\cite{rode2021estimating, carleton2022valuing}.
> 
> Rapid progress on climate impacts requires new tools-- like my CIL projection system-- which help researchers with the necessary sophisticated analysis. The ACP relied on an innovative online tool I developed for performing econometric meta-analyses (\url{http://dmas.berkeley.edu/}), designed to allow any researcher to expand the database of economic risks.  Drawing from my experience with the CIL's climate risk evaluation and my engagement with the community for detailed-processing modeling \cite{ciscar2019assessing}, I have developed a method to estimate damages across multiple risks that enables rapid, decentralized expansion of the collection of risks \cite{rising2022missing}.
> I have translated these solutions into public tools and materials to facilitate climate impact projections more widely, including a tutorial under review at the Journal of Open Source Education (\url{https://climateestimate.net/}).
> 
> As a demonstration of these methods and a case study for their further development, I have produced the first plausibly-comprehensive estimate of the costs of climate change, by combining a large collections of risk models and an estimate of missing risks for the United Kingdom. This work was released as a public report, emphasizing comprehensiveness, spatial inequality, and risk \cite{rising2022will} (funded by the European Climate Foundation). I am now preparing an extension of this work for academic publication, incorporating expert elicitation, econometric estimates, process-based models, and spill-over effects. The approach also provides a template for performing high-quality climate risk assessments in other countries, for which I am pursuing funding.

Most of my research under this agenda focuses on the role of interactions across space (cross-boundary flows \cite{ramesh2019small}, climate inequality \cite{carleton2022valuing}, neighbor-dependence \cite{taylor2021tipping}), but has also touched on issues like cross-scale

With a new comprehensive description of inter-basin transfers \cite{siddik2023interbasin} (funded by USGS) and state-level water use dataset \cite{josset2019us}, this model has the potential to change our understanding of resource conflicts and environmental footprints and to improved management strategies across the United States \cite{brelsford2020developing}.

I am the lead developer for the PAGE model, after co-leading the translation of the model into an open-source framework, in accordance with my work to rapidly expand the capacity of researchers to perform climate risk analysis \cite{moore2018mimi}. Through a paper led by my Masters students, PAGE now has,
