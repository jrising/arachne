> What's a short word for "high quality" or "best available"? I am categorizing which features models have, and each one could be ignored or missing; stylized; or THIS.

> A good word for what you are describing could be "robust". It conveys the sense of being high-quality or the best available, suggesting that the features or models are strong, reliable, and well-founded.

> Here are the described methodologies for several papers on macroeconomic and fiscal risks:
> Methodology
> "Data: ""Real Total Factor Productivity from National Accounts data"" from PWT 8.1.
> Regress TFP growth on FD(Temp), FD(Prec.), FE, then interact with poor and hot."
> Uninsured losses from selected disasters from EM-DAT are multiplied by "factor increases" based on PESETA IV damages. Assumes events have direct impacts on gov. accounts and indirect effect on GDP.
> "‘bottom-up’ damage functions applied to the Treasury Industry Model - a multisector general equilibrium model of the Australian economy with forward-looking agents." Drawing on Roson and Sartori (2016), the International Labour Organization (2019) and Kompas et al (2021).
> Econometric study extrapolating from time use surveys in Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Spain, UK, and USA. Daily temperatures drive change in hours worked for high and low-exposed workers. High-exposed workers decreases with income.
> IAM building on Golosov and Nordhaus plus "dynamic optimal Ramsey taxation framework". "(i) temperature change alters aggregate productivity, (ii) temperature change enters household utility, (iii) sea level rise depreciates the capital stock, (iv) temperature change affects the cost of providing government services, (v) temperature change affects government transfers to households, (vi) sea level rise affects the governmentís optimal expenditures on coastal protection."
> Use random forest model to relate changes in GDP (later driven by Kahn et al.) to changes in credit ratings and borrowing costs.
> Panel estimate of impacts on physical capital and mortality due to cyclones, then input into DICE model for future projections. Theoretical model used to translate from coefficient estimates to impacts, which are framed as "capital depreciation".
> Sector-specific valuation and adaptation assumptions, under FrEDI-style emulation. Includes GDP and population growth and uncertainty (mainly from climate).
> GMM estimate of CRI on inflation, with lagged inflation. CRI from Chen et al. (2024), covers 130 countries (but only 101 used). Then Pooled Mean Group estimate of adjustment rate.
> 95 countries from 1992–2020. IV-2SLS to account for endogeneity, instrumented by the country’s national latitude5 multiplied by the proportion of clean energy in energy use. Unemployment rate is of population that is available and seeking employment.

> I want to collect "analytical features" in a standardized way. Some of my ideas are:
>  - Inclusion of tipping points: Missing, stylized, or robust. (But these aren't really there, so maybe not include this one?)
>  - Calibration approach: Econometric, Macro-model, or Stylised
>  - Hazard definition: Acute shocks, Chronic change, or ?
>  - Something on the persistence of impacts?
>  - Sectoral disaggrregation
>  - Spatial disaggregation
>  - Changing economy
> 
> What would you suggest? I want a total of about 6, with a decent amount of variation across the papers.
**assistant**:
> Based on the methodologies you provided and your interest in capturing a diverse range of analytical features, here are six suggested categories to standardize your collection of analytical features:
> 
> 1. **Calibration Approach**: 
>    - Options: Econometric, Macro-model, or Stylized
> 
> 2. **Hazard Definition**: 
>    - Options: Acute Shocks, Chronic Change, or Gradual Trends
> 
> 3. **Persistence of Impacts**: 
>    - Options: Short-term (temporary), Medium-term (several years), or Long-term (permanent)
> 
> 4. **Sectoral Disaggregation**: 
>    - Options: High, Moderate, or Low disaggregation (e.g., distinct sectors vs. aggregated categories)
> 
> 5. **Spatial Disaggregation**: 
>    - Options: Global, Regional, or Local (e.g., effects on specific countries or cities)
> 
> 6. **Economic Dynamics**: 
>    - Options: Static, Transitional (accounting for changes over time), or Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts)
> 
> This framework maintains a balance of analytical rigor and variation across the papers, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of methodologies and their outcomes.
