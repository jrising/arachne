**user**:
> My ice cream maker use steps say "Place the lid on the bowl and store it in the freezer (0°F/-18°C) for at least 24 hours before using." But the lid seems to have all the electronics in it too. Do I really put that all in the freezer?
**assistant**:
> It seems there may be a misunderstanding. When the instructions say to place the lid on the bowl and store it in the freezer, they're likely referring to just the removable bowl of the ice cream maker, not the unit with the electronic components. 
> 
> The bowl needs to be completely frozen before you use it in order to properly make ice cream. 
> 
> The lid with the electronics would not need to be, and in fact should not be, frozen. Having electronics in extreme temperatures like your freezer can harm the equipment. 
> 
> If there's confusion, it's always a good idea to check the user manual for your specific model of ice cream maker, or reach out to the manufacturer for clarification.
