> In QGIS, I am working with the layout designer. My data uses categorical colors, and one of the colors is used for NULL values in the column. When I view my data normally, I see this color. But in the layout designer, it does not show up in the legend (although it is on the map). How can I add it to the legend?
**assistant**:
> In QGIS, to show the NULL (or any other special value) category in the layout designer's legend you'll need to follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Go back to the main QGIS interface and open the `Layer Styling` panel, which can be found in the `View` > `Panels` > `Layer Styling` path.
> 
> 2. From there, click on the `Legend` tab.
> 
> 3. Check the box labeled "Show All Classes". If the NULL values have a specific category in your data, this should now show it in the legend.
> 
> When you return to the `Layout Designer`, the legend should now reflect all classes including NULL values.
> 
> Remember that any changes you make in the layout won't be reflected in the main QGIS interface's layer styling panel, and vice versa.
