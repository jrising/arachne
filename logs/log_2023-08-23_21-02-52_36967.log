> The term for the floor of the ocean is called the "ocean floor" or "seafloor". Within these broad categories, the ocean floor has different regions: the "continental shelf" (near the shore), the "continental slope" (where it starts to descend), the "continental rise" (a gentler slope), and the "abyssal plain" (the deep, flat areas). The deepest parts, or trenches, are often referred to as "hadal zones".
