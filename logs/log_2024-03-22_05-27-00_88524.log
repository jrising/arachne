**assistant**:
> This passage is a description of the speaker's work, hobbies, and an upcoming project. Let me break it down:
> 
> 1. **Work**: The speaker is a computer programmer at a hedge fund, and is involved in the reinsurance strategy. Reinsurance is an arrangement in which insurance companies pass on the risks of insurances they have issued to other firms, to reduce the likelihood of having to pay out a powerful claim. The speaker uses numerical analysis to estimate losses from natural disasters.
> 
> 2. **Interest in sustainability**: The speaker's work has led them to investigate the performance of buildings in the face of these natural disasters, including their own home. 
> 
> 3. **Project**: The person wants to create a system for real-time tracking of power consumption in their home. They have fun using a software-defined radio (SDR) to read Electronic Receiver/Transmitters (ERTs) from iTron meters, which monitor electricity or water use. 
> 
> 4. **Limitations**: The speaker is facing a few issues. First, the details they can get out of the ERT readings are limited to a kilowatt hour's worth, i.e., they can track how much power is being used, but not what it's being used for. Second, the data transmission they're using is being replaced by a secured system they can't tap into.
> 
> 5. **Goal**: The speaker hopes to dissect the energy consumption in a home into categories like heating, cooling, and hot water. They'd like the system to behave like the energy monitoring system Sense.io, but also let the user have complete control of their data.
> 
> 6. **Possible Solutions**: The speaker noted protocols like Zigbee for wireless data transmission and ANSI Type II optical probe, a standard connection to directly interface with the meter physically.
> 
> Finally, the speaker is willing to pay for expertise and research in this area.

**assistant**:
> To create a system for real-time tracking of power consumption in a home using a software-defined radio (SDR) to read Electronic Receiver/Transmitters (ERTs) from iTron meters, you would need to follow these general steps:
> 
> 1. **Understand the System**: Gain a deeper understanding of the ERT meters and their communication protocols. This involves knowing how the meters transmit data, the format of the data, and any encryption methods used.
> 
> 2. **Research and Experimentation**: Given that your goal is to move beyond kilowatt-hour granularity, you would need to research methods to extract more granular data from the meters. Experiment with decoding techniques to see if you can access more detailed information regarding energy consumption.
> 
> 3. **Software Development**: Develop or modify software that can interface with the SDR to capture and decode the signals being emitted by the ERT meters. This software will need to process the data in real-time and extract the relevant information for your analysis.
> 
> 4. **Data Disaggregation**: Once you have a reliable way to capture the data, work on algorithms that can disaggregate the energy consumption data into specific categories such as space heating, cooling, hot water, cooking, and lighting. This involves statistical analysis and pattern recognition to differentiate between different types of energy usage based on the data collected.
> 
> 5. **User Interface and Control**: Design a user-friendly interface that displays the disaggregated energy consumption data in a meaningful way for the homeowner. Ensure that the system allows the user to maintain control of their data and privacy, as mentioned in your initial text.
> 
> 6. **Testing and Validation**: Test the system extensively to ensure its accuracy and reliability in capturing and disaggregating energy consumption data. Validate the results against known patterns of energy usage in the home.
> 
> 7. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously improve the system based on feedback and further research. Stay updated on advancements in metering technology and data analysis techniques to enhance the system's capabilities.
> 
> By following these steps and possibly seeking expertise on utility metering systems and data analysis, you can work towards creating a system for real-time tracking and detailed analysis of power consumption in a home using software-defined radio technology.
