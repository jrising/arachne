>    \[
>    \begin{aligned}
>    y_t &= a y_{t-1} + b y_{t-2}, \\
>    y_{t-1} &= y_{t-1}.

>    J = \begin{bmatrix} 
>    a & b \\ 
>    1 & 0 
>    \end{bmatrix}.
>    \]
> 
> 3. **Eigenvalues of the Jacobian**: The stability of the system is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. Find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation:
> 
>    \[
>    \text{det}(J - \lambda I) = 0
>    \]

> 
>    \[
>    \begin{vmatrix} 
>    a - \lambda & b \\ 
>    1 & -\lambda 
>    \end{vmatrix} = (a-\lambda)(-\lambda) - b = \lambda^2 - a\lambda - b = 0.
>    \]
> 
>    Solve for \(\lambda\) to get the eigenvalues.

> 4. **Calculate the Lyapunov Exponent**: If the system is purely linear (as given), the Lyapunov exponents can be obtained directly based on the eigenvalues. Specifically, the log of the largest absolute eigenvalue (also known as the spectral radius) gives you the maximal Lyapunov exponent:
> 
>    \[
>    \lambda_{\text{max}} = \log(\max(|\lambda_1|, |\lambda_2|)).
>    \]
> 
> 5. **Interpretation**: 
>    - If \(\lambda_{\text{max}} < 0\), the system is stable (exponentially decaying solutions).
>    - If \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = 0\), the system is neutrally stable (typically oscillatory).
>    - If \(\lambda_{\text{max}} > 0\), the system is unstable, indicating exponential growth and potential chaotic behavior.
> 
> Given the quadratic nature of the characteristic equation, solving for \(\lambda\) likely requires numerical computation, especially for non-trivial \(a\) and \(b\). Let me know if you need further assistance with a specific set of parameters.
