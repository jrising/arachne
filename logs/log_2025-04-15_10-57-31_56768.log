**assistant**:
> "Return on Investment" (ROI) is a financial metric used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment. It is typically calculated as a percentage and helps to understand the returns on an investment relative to its cost.
> 
> For a single investment, ROI is calculated as:
> 
> \[ \text{ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Total Investment Cost}} \right) \times 100 \]
> 
> Where:
> - Net Profit is the total returns (or gains) from the investment minus the costs of the investment.
> 
> When dealing with a stream of benefits or cash flows over time, the calculation of ROI becomes more complex, as value changes over time. In such cases, you might use more advanced metrics like Net Present Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR), which consider the time value of money.
> 
> To calculate ROI with a stream of benefits:
> 1. **Calculate the Present Value of Benefits (PV):** Discount each cash flow back to its present value using a discount rate. Sum these present values to obtain the total present value of benefits.
> 2. **Determine Total Investment Costs (C):** Sum all costs associated with the investment.
> 3. **Calculate ROI:** 
> 
>    \[ \text{ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{PV} - C}{C} \right) \times 100 \]
> 
> Here, PV represents the discounted total benefits, and C is the total initial cost. This approach gives a more accurate reflection of ROI when cash flows are spread over time.
