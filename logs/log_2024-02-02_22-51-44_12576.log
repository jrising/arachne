**user**:
> In the jquery-ui menu class, is it possible to refresh the menu without losing your place in it?
**assistant**:
> No, the jQuery UI menu's `.refresh()` method will rebuild the entire active menu for any changes in its structure. This does mean if you dynamically add/remove items from the menu structure, you would lose the current 'active' state and the menu would go back to its initial state. You'll have to manage the active state of the menu manually by keeping track of this information.
> 
> One workaround could be to save the focus or active state before calling refresh and then recalling it. Here's a simple example of how you can manually manage the state:
> 
> ```javascript
> var active = $( "#menu" ).find( ".ui-state-focus" ).attr( 'id' );
> 
> $( "#menu" ).menu( "refresh" );
> 
> // Restore focus
> $( "#" + active ).focus();
> ```
> 
> This solution assumes that each menu item has a unique id. If that's not the case, you might need to find another method to identify active items (like saving information related to the item's contents or position).
