> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified various ways to address ocean and biological data gaps.
> 
> Here is a summary of the recommendations from the RWSC 2024:
> ===
> The “Integrated Science Plan for Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic Waters,” developed by the Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative for Offshore Wind (RWSC) provides useful input in addressing data gaps in offshore activities, particularly wildlife and habitat considerations, and sustainable energy infrastructure development (RWSC 2024).
> The document lays out a framework for addressing these gaps, recommending several methods to better understand and mitigate impacts from offshore wind activities:
> 
> 
> Data Management: RWSC advises leveraging and coordinating existing data management infrastructure. The goal is to ensure that the volume and variety of offshore wind and wildlife data being collected can be effectively processed and utilized.
> Appropriate Data Collection and Sharing Practices: Institutions are encouraged to adopt consistent data collection, management, storage, and sharing practices to ensure accuracy and usability of data. Collaborations and data sharing agreements are also suggested among entities involved in offshore wind projects to facilitate access to vital datasets.
> Tailored Data Collection: RWSC also recommends species-specific data collection and research based on individual subregions, in accordance with the Science Plan.
> Baseline Data Collection: Ongoing need for baseline data collection for relevant species is emphasized, with a focus on species that are relatively data-poor, like sea turtles, bats, and protected fish species. RWSC highlights the need to monitor species’ movement in wind energy areas.
> Consistency in Methodology and Tools: They endorse the use of consistent methods and tools for data collection, analysis, and management to support regional scale assessments and the creation of regional data products.
> Expanded Research and Surveys: RWSC advocates for expanded wildlife surveys and sensor networks throughout the study area. The surveys should optimally be designed to detect broad scale phenomena such as species displacement, changes in abundance, and changes in behavior and health.
> 
> 
> RWSC also envisions the Science Plan to serve as a guide for the scientific community, inspiring their research objectives and funding decisions related to offshore wind and wildlife efforts. The objective is to create an adaptive, collaborative, and efficient environment for data collection and research to facilitate sustainable offshore wind development. The RWSC will maintain a Research Database and provide tools and forums for planning discussions and collaboration, ensuring data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).
> 
> 
> Finally, RWSC will reassess the Science Plan and its collaboration framework every five years to respond to changes in the rapidly evolving offshore wind industry, promising to track progress on the recommendations laid out in the plan annually. By doing this, it aims to constantly bridge any existing or emerging data gaps.

> | Funding                     | Data collection, management, sharing and use are expensive, and governments and other stakeholders are often resource-constrained.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Increase congressional funding commensurate with the growing volume and variety of ocean data that will need to be managed and shared via portals or the cloud. Develop new policies ensuring data management is equitably funded by taxpayers and private industry and access to data collected under federal permit is publicly available.                                         |
> | Forming partnerships        | Federal government and regional data stewards are not fully leveraging their collective capacity to share or make data publicly available.                                                                                                                                                                              | The Ocean Policy Committee (OPC) should examine data portals, products and services across federal agencies for improved collaboration and efficiency, namely through shared funding, combining duplicative efforts, and improving interagency, regional, state, Tribal and community collaboration identified in consultation with federal agencies and the broader ocean community. |
> | Data sharing                | There is a lack of available incentives and policy frameworks for private industry, academic scientists and other data collectors to share their data. Specifically, academic or industry ocean research data funded or required for regulatory reasons by NOAA are not always posted to publicly accessible platforms. | NOAA should evaluate the effectiveness of its Public Access to Research Results (PARR) plan and strengthen accountability measures for more timely and complete submission of data by researchers or federal permittees/lessees.                                                                                                                                                      |
> | Privacy and confidentiality | New technologies enable the efficient collection and transmission of digital data for near real-time management, but federal laws err on the side of restricting such data releases to protect personal or proprietary information.                                                                                     | Balance privacy/confidentiality and open access of data by adapting approaches used in the health care industry to anonymize data while allowing it to be publicly accessed or allowing access under controlled conditions or for specific purposes.                                                                                                                                  |

> | Domain- and region- specific data gaps | Data domains and regions across the nation have different and sometimes unique data<br>needs, although the following data gaps or needs are common across regions: marine species, commercial fishing vessel location, catch and effort, recreational fishing effort, bycatch and fish discards and bathymetry. | The OPC and federal partners, including NOAA, should create ongoing mechanisms to solicit input on regional data needs as was done in the 2018 Regional Data Platform scoping study conducted by NOAA and DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). OPC should work with the regions to pursue data collection (and needed funding) in deficient, high- priority data categories identified in the scoping study, leveraging existing or new studies (e.g., the National Strategy). |

> Can you combine these summaries, citing the underlying sources, and provide a general overview of recommendations to address data gaps with a view toward data gaps relevant to Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process? 
**assistant**:
> Addressing the significant data gaps in Delaware’s ocean and bay planning involves the implementation of several strategic policies, technological advancements, and thoughtful safeguarding of natural resources. Drawing upon the recommendations from two key sources, the Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative for Offshore Wind (RWSC) 2024 report, and Trice et al. 2021, I'll present a synthesized view, highlighting the most pertinent solutions.
> 
> **Data Management:**
> Crucially, it's suggested to leverage existing data management infrastructure to process the vast array of offshore wind, wildlife, and ocean data [RWSC 2024]. The Ocean Policy Committee (OPC) could help analyze data across federal agencies for increased collaboration and efficiency [Trice et al. 2021].
> 
> **Data Collection and Sharing Practices:**
> Consistent data collection, storage, and sharing practices across institutions are encouraged [RWSC 2024]. Particularly, NOAA should evaluate and strengthen its Public Access to Research Results (PARR) plan to promote researcher data submission [Trice et al. 2021].
> 
> **Tailored Data Collection:**
> Species-specific data collection and research are recommended, including ongoing need for baseline data for data-poor species such as sea turtles, bats, and protected fish and under-studied areas [RWSC 2024].
> 
> **Data Interoperability:**
> The Office of Science and Technology Program (OSTP) should work on advancing Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles [Trice et al. 2021].
> 
> **Expanded Research and Surveys:**
> Wildlife surveys and sensor networks throughout the study area should be expanded to comprehend phenomena such as species displacement, abundance changes, or health and behavior changes [RWSC 2024].
> 
> **Privacy and Confidentiality:**
> This aspect involves maintaining a balance between data openness and protecting personal or proprietary information [Trice et al. 2021].
> 
> **Integrating New Data Sources:**
> The continuous incorporation of novel and efficient technologies for collecting ocean and fisheries data is considered essential [Trice et al. 2021].
>   
> **Cloud Computing:**
> To house increasingly large datasets, cloud-based data platforms such as NOAA’s Big Data Program (BDP) should be enhanced [Trice et al. 2021].
> 
> **Stakeholder Technical Capacity:**
> Training stakeholders, particularly those in remote areas, will promote the adoption of standards and new technologies [Trice et al. 2021].
> 
> **Addressing Domain- and Region-specific Data Gaps:**
> There should be a concerted effort to match the unique data needs of different regions, paying heed to deficient, high-priority data categories [Trice et al. 2021].
> 
> By using these recommendations, Delaware can strive to address its ocean and bay planning data gaps. This requires collaboration, fund allocation, innovative use of technology, and ongoing reassessment to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of offshore activities.
