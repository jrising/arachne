> What is it called when you drop the x% of values from the extremes of your data? I thought there was a term like "Windzorising"?
**assistant**:
> The term you're looking for is "Winsorizing". Winsorizing a dataset means replacing the extreme values, often positioned in the lowest and/or highest percentiles, with less extreme values, typically the next closest values that are not considered extreme. It's a method often used to reduce the impact of outliers on statistical analyses.

> As with any data transformation, it's important to use Winsorizing judiciously, and keep in mind that it can distort original values. One should also be transparent about it when reporting results.
