**user**:
> I have a bunch of PHP files which use the SQL_CACHE statement in code (e.g., "SELECT SQL_CACHE * FROM `##block` WHERE block_id=?"), but as I understand it, this is no longer supported by MySQL. I would like to remove SQL_CACHE from all of these files on Linux, but otherwise keep the code the same. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> You can use a command line utility like `sed` to achieve this task quite handily. The `sed` command basically modifies files in place, and it's very good at finding and replacing text. The following command will remove all instances of "SQL_CACHE" in your PHP files:
> 
> ```bash
> 
> find . -name "*.php" -type f -exec sed -i 's/SQL_CACHE//g' {} \;
> 
> ```
> 
> Let's break down the command:
> 
> - `find . -name "*.php" -type f`: searches current (.) directory (and sub-directories) for PHP files
> - `-exec sed -i 's/SQL_CACHE//g' {} \;`: executes (`-exec`) the `sed` command on each file (`{}`) found. This finds each instance of "SQL_CACHE" and replaces it with nothing (effectively deleting it).
> 
> Please note that:
> 
> 1. This command is recursive and will operate on the current directory and its subdirectories.
> 2. The `-i` option in `sed` command modifies the files in place. If you want to keep the original files for comparison and save the changes to new files, use `-i.bak` instead of `-i` to create a backup for each file.
> 3. Test this on a small subset of your files first to make sure it's doing what you expect before running it on all your files. Regular expressions can sometimes have unexpected results.
> 
> Hope this helps! Don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions.
