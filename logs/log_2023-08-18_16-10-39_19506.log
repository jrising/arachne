**assistant**:
> The easiest way may be to use Python, specifically the `geopandas` and `shapely` libraries which are designed for geospatial operations. Here is a simple script that can convert your list of coordinates into a shapefile.

> In first step, we have to convert your coordinates to the decimal degrees format because the Geopandas operates with decimal degrees:

>     degrees, minutes, seconds, direction = re.split('[°′″]', s)
>     dd = float(degrees) + float(minutes)/60 + float(seconds)/(60*60);
>     if direction in ('S','W'):
>         dd*= -1

**user**:
> Does the last entry need to be a duplicate of the first entry to be a closed loop?
**assistant**:
> No, the last entry doesn't need to be a duplicate of the first entry to form a closed loop. The `Polygon` class from the `shapely` library automatically closes the polygon by connecting the last point to the first point. So, as long as your coordinates form a continuous sequence where the last point connects to the first point, the resulting polygon will be closed.
> 
> In other words, the last entry in your list of coordinates doesn't need to be a duplicate of the first entry for the shapefile to represent a closed polygon.
