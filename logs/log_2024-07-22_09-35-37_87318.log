> 
> 
> This MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of the last signature date below, between Nuvve Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, with headquarters located at 2488 Historic Decatur Road, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92106 (“Nuvve”), and James Rising, with its principal address at 1940 S. Alder St., Philadelphia, PA 19148 (together with its Affiliates, each a “Party” to this Agreement).
> 
> 1.	Purpose. The Parties wish to explore business opportunities of mutual interest (the “Purpose”) and in connection with such opportunities each Party may disclose or may have already disclosed to the other (the “Disclosing Party”), certain confidential technical and business information which the Disclosing Party desires the recipient of such information (the “Receiving Party”) to treat as confidential.
> 
> 2.	Confidential Information. Each Party has developed, acquired, or otherwise has the rights to certain non-public technical, confidential, and proprietary information, including, but not limited to: patentable and non-patentable inventions, innovations, discoveries, research, algorithms; intellectual property; software (whether human-readable or machine-readable); know-how; product or services architecture; trade secrets; drawings; designs; processes; specifications; technical data; analyses; studies; developments; methodologies; present and future products and services; product, services, and solutions roadmaps; business and marketing plans; business development plans and strategies; strategic business plans; competitive analyses and data; financing arrangements; financial information, financial analyses and forecasts; cost and pricing data; employee or contractor information; customer or partner information; procurement requirements; vendor and supplier information, third-party manufacturer information; licensing and distribution arrangements; or other documents, information, and materials which contain or reflect such information, whether in oral, written, electronic, graphic, photographic, recorded, prototype, sample or in any other form, relating to such Party’s proprietary technologies, research programs, business, compounds and materials, third-party information that the Disclosing Party is under an obligation to keep confidential; and any information that the Receiving Party knew, or should have known, was considered confidential or proprietary by the Disclosing Party, shall be considered Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party under this Agreement (collectively, the “Confidential Information” of such Party). Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which (a) was publicly known or made generally and lawfully available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes publicly known or made generally available after disclosure by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party through no action or inaction of the Receiving Party or its Representatives (as defined below); (c)  lawfully comes into the possession of  the Receiving Party from a third party on a non-confidential basis as evidenced by the Receiving Party and as far as the Receiving Party is aware is provided by such third party other than in a breach of confidentiality obligation owed to it by the Disclosing Party; (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the Receiving Party’s possession; or (e) is expressly approved for disclosure by the Disclosing Party in writing.  
> 
> 3.	Non-use and Non-disclosure. Each Party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than the Purpose. Each Party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party to Third Parties or to such Party’s employees, except to those officers, directors, managers, employees and consultants (hereinafter “Representatives”) of the Receiving Party and its Affiliates (“Affiliate” has the meaning as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, and U.S. Code 17 C.F.R. § 230.405) who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business relationship.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party will not be prevented from, after providing prior written notice to the Disclosing Party, unless such notice is prohibited by applicable law, disclosing any Confidential Information to any person or court if and to the extent required by law or governments or government agencies in pursuant to subpoenas or other discovery or inquiry procedures or pursuant to reporting requirements of such governments or government agencies; provided that the Receiving Party will use reasonable efforts to have such person, court, governments or government agencies treat such information as confidential, so the Disclosing Party may seek appropriate relief from the court order and, provided further, that the Receiving Party shall only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and shall request confidential treatment of the Confidential Information. Neither Party shall modify, adapt, decode, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any products, services, samples, models, pre-production samples, prototypes, software (or create derivative works based in whole or in part on the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence, and organization of any software) or other tangible objects which embody the other Party’s Confidential Information and which are provided to the Party hereunder.  The Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing if it becomes aware of any use or disclosure of any Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives and the Receiving Party and its Representatives will cooperate in every reasonable way to help the Disclosing Party regain possession and exclusive control of such Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized use and disclosure.
> 
> 
> 4.	Maintenance of Confidentiality. Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information is a special, valuable and unique asset of the Disclosing Party and is the Disclosing Party’s sole and exclusive property. Each Party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other Party. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information and shall ensure that its employees and Representatives who have access to Confidential Information of the other Party have signed a non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions hereof, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employees and Representatives. The Receiving Party shall be liable for the acts and omissions of the Receiving Party's Representatives and any and all persons to whom it may directly or indirectly disclose any Confidential Information or who may acquire any Confidential Information as a result of the Receiving Party's default, as it they were the Receiving Party's own acts and omissions.  Accordingly, and without limitation, any unauthorized disclosure by a Representative shall be deemed to be an unauthorized disclosure by the Receiving Party. Neither Party shall make any copies of the Confidential Information of the other Party unless strictly necessary for the Purpose or unless previously approved in writing by the other Party. Each Party shall reproduce the other Party’s proprietary rights notices on any such approved copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.
> 
> 5.	No Obligation. Nothing herein shall obligate either Party to disclose any particular Confidential Information or proceed with any transaction between them, and each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning such business opportunities.
> 
> 6.	No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” EACH PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION’S ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.
> 
> 7.	Return of Materials. All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information which have been disclosed by either Party to the other Party, and all copies , notes, abstracts and records made thereof or any other item(s) or document(s) containing or embodying the Confidential Information (collectively, the “Confidential Materials”) which are in the possession of the other Party, shall be and remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall be promptly returned to the Disclosing Party upon the Disclosing Party’s written request or at the Disclosing Party’s option permanently and securely destroyed and the Receiving Party shall give written confirmation that it has destroyed the Confidential Materials in accordance with this Section.  The return or destruction of the Confidential Materials shall not, however, affect the Receiving Party’s obligations to treat such Confidential Materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain Confidential Materials: (i) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or (ii) as part of its automatic electronic archiving and back-up procedures.
> 
> 8.	No License. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant, or imply, any ownership rights, license, reproduction, replication or reconstruction and usage rights to either Party under any trademark, patent, patent application, mask work right or copyright or any other intellectual property right or interest of the other Party, nor shall this Agreement grant any Party any rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other Party except as expressly set forth herein.
> 
> 9.	Term. The term of this Agreement shall be until the earlier of: (a) five (5) years from the Effective Date (defined below) hereof; (b) the date the Purpose is fulfilled; (c) the date the Parties enter into a separate agreement governing the future exchange of Confidential Information. However, in the case of (a) and (b), the limitations on use and disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed hereunder shall survive until the earlier of: (i) such time as the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known or made generally and lawfully available through no action or inaction of the Receiving Party or its Representatives; or (ii) five (5) years after termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided however, trade secrets shall survive for as long as protected under applicable law. In the case of (c), the Parties’ obligations in this Agreement shall cease to apply to Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement once the Parties enter into another such agreement, in which case such Confidential Information shall, from the effective date of that agreement, be governed by the confidentiality provisions of that agreement.  If the Receiving Party is in breach of this Agreement or in the event that the Confidential Information or any part of it is disclosed by any Representative of the Receiving Party to any third party, then without prejudice to any other rights or remedies, the Disclosing Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately.
> 
> 10.	Remedies. Each Party agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement may cause irreparable injury to the other Party entitling the other Party, without proof of special damages or need to post a bond, to seek injunctive relief, specific performance or any other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of this Agreement in addition to all legal remedies.
> 
> 11.	Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party and any such purported assignment, absent such written consent, shall be null and void and of no legal effect.  This Agreement shall apply to the respective assigns and successors of the Parties.
> 
> 12.	Notices. All notices between the Parties about this Agreement must be in writing and delivered by hand, sent by confirmed courier, or by certified or registered mail to the addressees at the top or other address as notified by a Party from time to time.  A copy of notices to Nuvve shall also be sent to notice@nuvve.com.  Notices shall be deemed to have been received when delivered.
> 
> 13.	Terms of Agreement and Publicity. Each Party agrees to keep the existence of and the contents of this Agreement (including the Purpose) confidential and shall not use this Agreement or the name of the other party in any advertisement or publicity campaign or other disclosure without the prior written consent of the other party.
> 
> 14.	Miscellaneous. The Confidential Information may not be accurate or complete and the Disclosing Party will not be liable to the Receiving Party or to anyone to whom the Receiving Party either directly or indirectly discloses the Confidential Information, or who may acquire any Confidential Information as a result of a disclosure in breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if such Confidential Information is relied upon.  Nothing in this section operates to limit or exclude any liability for fraud or for any other liability which is not permitted to be limited or excluded by operation of law. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. This document contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither Party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other Party except as set forth herein.  Any failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision.  This Agreement may not be amended, nor any obligation waived, except by a writing signed by both Parties hereto.  Should any provision of this Agreement be or become invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision in this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which when executed and delivered in an original but which all counterparts together shall constitute the same document.

> I have only signed NDAs as an independent consultant before, not as a grantee. They want to share some proprietary information with me, but I want to make sure that I can still publish (if I'm careful). So my questions are:
>  - Would this restrict me from publishing, or what would I have to do in my research process to ensure that I can still publish?
>  - Is my signing this likely to be a problem with the University?
>  - Is there anything atypical about this NDA compared to others I might have signed?
**assistant**:
> Great questions, James! Let's address each of them one-by-one:
> 
> ### Restrictions on Publishing
> 
> The NDA restricts the use and disclosure of Confidential Information, meaning any proprietary information provided by Nuvve that falls under the categories defined in section 2 of the NDA. To ensure you can publish your research:
> 
> 1. **Distinguish Confidential Information**: Make sure you clearly understand and document what information provided by Nuvve is considered Confidential Information. Keep this separate from your general research data whenever possible.
> 
> 2. **Independent Development**: According to clause 2(d), if you can demonstrate that your research findings were developed independently without use of or reference to Nuvve's Confidential Information, you should be clear to publish.
> 
> 3. **Permissions**: If your research involves or builds upon Nuvve's Confidential Information, obtain written approval from them to publish those specific parts of your research.
> 
> 4. **Compliance**: Ensure the confidentiality provisions in the NDA are fully complied with, especially regarding the non-disclosure and non-use requirements in section 3.
> 
> ### Potential Issues with the University
> 
> Universities typically have their policies regarding NDAs, usually to ensure academic freedom and the right to publish research findings. 
> 
> 1. **Consult Legal Counsel**: Before signing, consult with your university's legal counsel or Tech Transfer Office. They can review the NDA to ensure it aligns with the university’s policies and your rights as a researcher.
> 
> 2. **Disclosure**: You might be required to disclose the NDA to your university if it's related to a grant that involves university resources or time.
> 
> ### Comparison with Other NDAs
> 
> 1. **General Structure**: The NDA is standard in many respects, outlining definitions of Confidential Information, non-use and non-disclosure obligations, and terms of confidentiality.
> 
> 2. **Detailed Confidentiality**: One notable point in your NDA is the broad and detailed listing of what constitutes Confidential Information, which might be more comprehensive than some NDAs you've encountered.
> 
> 3. **Term Duration**: The NDA mentions that the confidentiality obligations survive beyond the term of the agreement up to five years or as long as necessary to protect trade secrets. This is relatively common but important to note.
> 
> 4. **Return or Destruction of Materials**: Clause 7 requiring the return or destruction of Confidential Materials is standard but ensure you understand the process fully.
> 
> 5. **Legal Injunctions**: Clause 10 on remedies like injunctive relief is fairly common in NDAs, highlighting the importance of compliance to avoid legal issues.
> 
> ### Recommendations
> 
> 1. **Seek Clarification**: Consider negotiating specific language in the NDA that addresses your concerns about publishing, perhaps an explicit clause that allows for publication of general research findings, or a process for obtaining permissions.
> 
> 2. **Document Independence**: Maintain detailed records showing how your research is developed without reliance on Nuvve's Confidential Information wherever possible.
> 
> 3. **Clear Communication**: Clearly communicate with both Nuvve and your university about your need to publish, ensuring transparency and alignment of expectations.
