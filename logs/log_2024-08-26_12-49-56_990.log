**assistant**:
> Over the past six months at IMT, my contributions have been diverse and expansive. I have strategically revised language to improve both our impact and appeal to businesses interested in sponsoring us. I have also made progress in designing and implementing a board engagement strategy, infusing it with fresh insights from webinars and conversations. With a focus on maximizing participation of existing members, I also explored the introduction of a stretch goal, and new expectations for incoming members. 
> 
> One of my significant strides was outlining a new methodology on corporate giving and assembling a comprehensive Membership Playbook. I have also successfully summarized and presented information through slides from the development team meetings to our stakeholders. An exhilarating project I led was the synthesis of notes from the Impact Summit and, importantly, identifying potential contacts for outreach and follow-up. 
> 
> At the core of these efforts was a continuous drive to consolidate our programs, resulting in a one-stop shop for our offerings, enabling us to secure non-earmarked funding. I have proactively initiated growth and funding strategies for GLL, although these are in the early stages. 
> 
> Continually finding creative ways to boost our appeal, I even came up with the idea of tote bag swag. The draft of a corporate giving policy was another significant undertaking of mine. The objective was not just to enhance the existing guidelines, but also to contemplate multiple asks in front of a company.
> 
> Amongst other achievements, I have identified objectives for development team growth and prioritized understanding and enhancing the value proposition of our existing programs. This involved identifying new partners and cultivating warm prospects. Key to this has been a focus on inclusivity and deeper partnerships. I've worked on sponsorship asks, like for hosting the Hub webinar series, and identified new revenue streams like the $5K tier for associations to join CEO. 
> 
> In order to better reach our corporate partners, I've been working on developing more effective collateral and a comprehensive 'Menu' of work offerings. Along with driving new funds from existing partners, this also allows us to foam a strategy to reach out to others in our field. 
> 
> Lastly, a noteworthy achievement was activating our board members to understand giving potential and introduce others to our mission. Part of my focus also lay in mentorship and leading the development team, advising SBK and helping her to identify and leverage new funding opportunities.  All this while maintaining consistent stewardship and ensuring sustainability remains at the forefront of our efforts.
