> A giant lived right at the top (as giants often do).
> At night, the giant’s stomping made the people sob and shake.
> “That shellfish giant!” Sophie scowled. “He’s keeping me awake.”
> 
> The princes asked her parents, “Why are giants mean and bad?”
> “Always have been,” said her mother. “Always will be,” said her dad.
> He found a book of fairy tales they kept high on a shelf.
> “It says so here, in black and white. Look, read it for yourself.”
> 
> So Sophie read a story set in murky days of old,
> When Jack climbed up a beanstalk and discovered piles of gold.
> A giant roared, “Get off my stuff! I’ll grind your bones for bread!
> I’ll FEE FI FO and FUN and then I’ll bob you on the head!”
> 
> That night poor Sophie tossed and turned. “Our giant’s such a pest.
> If only he would go to sleep, we might all get some rest.”
> She read about a witch who made a house from gingerbread.
> It made her tummy rumble and a plan formed in her head.
> 
> At midnight, Princess Sophie took some bottles and some packets.
> She piled them in her backpack then buttoned up her jacket.
> She clambered up the beanstalk. Brave Sophie didn’t stop
> Till she reached the giant’s castle, that was balanced on the top.

> L’ÉDUCATION
> 
> Laridon (1) et César, frères dont l'origine
> Venait de chiens fameux, beaux, bien faits et hardis,
> A deux maîtres divers échus au temps jadis,
> Hantaient l'un les forêts, et l'autre la cuisine.
> Ils avaient eu d'abord chacun un autre nom ;
>                Mais la diverse nourriture
> Fortifiant en l'un cette heureuse nature,
> En l'autre l'altérant, un certain marmiton
>                Nomma celui-ci Laridon :
> Son frère, ayant couru mainte haute aventure,
> Mis maint Cerf aux abois, maint Sanglier abattu,
> Fut le premier César que la gent chienne ait eu.
> On eut soin d'empêcher qu'une indigne maîtresse
> Ne fît en ses enfants dégénérer son sang :
> Laridon négligé témoignait sa tendresse
>                À l'objet le premier passant.
>                Il peupla tout de son engeance :
> Tournebroches (2) par lui rendus communs en France
> Y font un corps à part, gens fuyants les hasards,
>                Peuple antipode des Césars.
> On ne suit pas (3) toujours ses aïeux ni son père :
> Le peu de soin, le temps, tout fait qu'on dégénère :
> Faute de cultiver la nature et ses dons,
> Ô combien de Césars deviendront Laridons !

> THE MAKING OF US
> 
> Once upon a time, two pups named Rufus and Caesar came to be,
> From a lineage of noble dogs, handsome, strong and feisty.
> They went their separate ways to masters old and new,
> One roamed the wild forests, the other a kitchen crew.
> 
> They were christened different names when they were pups so small,
> But diet played its part in how they grew so tall.
> While one thrived on the hunt, with food hearty and bold,
> The other, called Rufus, ate scraps from pots of old.
> 
> The forest dog had chased his prey, had howls and cheers aplenty,
> First of his name, Caesar, revered by the doggy gentry.
> Care was taken for his line, to prevent any disgrace,
> A proud lineage of strong dogs, a truly noble race.
> 
> Poor Rufus, left unguarded, shared his affection freely,
> Loving anyone who passed, without thinking really.
> He fathered many a pup, a lineage so diverse,
> Kitchen dogs, spit-turners, a Caesar's universe in reverse.
> 
> Following your kin or sire isn't always how it goes,
> Neglect and time can cause the noblest lineage to decompose.
> If we don't nurture nature and the gifts it brings,
> Many a Caesar might turn into a Rufus, with his kitchen flings!

**user**:
> What would you assess the reading level for this draft as? And what would you assess the reading level of the Caryl Hart excerpt?
**assistant**:
> The draft translation of the La Fontaine fable and the Caryl Hart excerpt are both suitable for children's literature. They share elements of rhyme and rhythm, which can aid in reading comprehension and engagement for younger readers.
> 
> 1. **Caryl Hart excerpt**: This excerpt seems suitable for children aged around 4-7 years. The vocabulary is relatively simple, with a focus on everyday words and a few more challenging terms. The story is written in rhyme, which can help younger children to predict what word is coming next, aiding their reading development. 
> 
> 2. **The Making of Us (Draft Translation)**: The reading level of the draft translation is slightly higher, perhaps more suited to children aged around 7-10 years. The vocabulary is more complex, featuring words like "lineage," "disgrace," and "decompose." Additionally, the underlying theme of the fable (nature vs. nurture and the consequences of neglect) is more sophisticated and may be better understood by older children. 
> 
> However, both texts are flexible and could be enjoyed by a range of age groups depending on the individual child's reading level and understanding.

**user**:
> Can you provide a new draft, for children aged around 7 years old?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely! Here's a revised version more suited for a 7-year-old's reading level:
> 
> THE MAKING OF US
> 
> Once upon a time, two pups named Ruff and Caesar, so small,
> Born from brave and strong dogs, the proudest of them all.
> Given to two different masters, they grew up far apart,
> One roamed the deep green forests, one stayed in the kitchen heart.
> 
> They had different names at first, as small pups usually do,
> But what they ate each day had effects as they grew.
> While Caesar, brave and strong, ate meals tasty and bold,
> Ruff, left with kitchen scraps, was never quite so bold.
> 
> Caesar, he chased and ran, he caught and brought down prey,
> He was the first dog named Caesar, in all his furry array.
> His pups were looked after, kept noble and so grand,
> While poor Ruff's were left to play with whatever came to hand.
> 
> Ruff, he loved everyone, showing it so dearly,
> To every creature that passed, without thinking clearly.
> He fathered many pups, of every shape and size,
> They turned spits in kitchens, under the cooks' watchful eyes.
> 
> You don't always follow what your father or family does,
> Without care and time, a proud lineage just because.
> If we don't take care of nature and the gifts it freely brings,
> A mighty Caesar can turn into a Ruff, with all his kitchen flings!
**user**:
> Can you suggest an alternative to the following lines:
>  - "While Caesar, brave and strong, ate meals tasty and bold,
> Ruff, left with kitchen scraps, was never quite so bold." - These should not both end with "bold".
>  - "They turned spits in kitchens, under the cooks' watchful eyes." - It isn't clear why dogs would be turning spits.
**assistant**:
> Certainly, I can provide alternative lines. Here they are:
> 
> - "While Caesar, brave and strong, ate meals hearty and grand,
> Ruff, left with kitchen scraps, couldn't quite take a stand."
> 
> - "His pups grew in the kitchens, under the cooks' watchful eyes,
> Learning about pots and pans, and how to bake tasty pies."
