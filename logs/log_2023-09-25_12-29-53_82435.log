**user**:
> I see from the FAO statistics that food insecurity is on the rise since 2014. Why is this?
**assistant**:
> Factors driving the rising trend of food insecurity since 2014, based on various reports and studies by FAO and other institutes, include:
> 
> 1. **Climate Change** - Unpredictable weather patterns and increasing frequency of extreme weather events has led to a decrease in agricultural yields, particularly in countries heavily reliant on agriculture.
> 
> 2. **Conflicts and Political Instability** - These often disrupt food production and the ability to import food. According to FAO, the prevalence of severe food insecurity is almost three times higher in countries with high levels of conflict.
> 
> 3. **Inadequate local and global investment in agriculture** - Especially in developing nations, there has been a long-term under-investment in the agricultural sector.
> 
> 4. **Population Growth and Urbanization** - More people and increasing urbanization strains the capacities to produce and distribute food.
> 
> 5. **Rising Prices and Economic Conditions** - Stagnating wages and increase in food prices can decrease access to food for vulnerable populations. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this by disrupting food supply chains and causing economic downturn.
> 
> 6. **Lack of resilience and safety nets** - In times of crises or shocks, the inability of vulnerable populations to recover can push them further into food and livelihood insecurity.
> 
> 7. **Fragmented food systems** - Local or national food systems may be inefficient, wasting resources and failing to deliver food where it's needed.
> 
> 8. **Loss of biodiversity** - The decline in biodiversity can compromise the resilience of agricultural and food systems.
> 
> Please note that the reasons can vary greatly from region to region and from year to year. A combination of these factors often operates together to exacerbate food insecurity.
