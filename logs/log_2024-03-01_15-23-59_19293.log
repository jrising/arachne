**user**:
> In the results from a run of RunGTAP, I see columns "(Sim)", "Pre", and "Post". What do these mean?
**assistant**:
> The "RunGTAP" is a General Purpose Computation Software that is extensively used for global economic analysis. The results are commonly expressed in the following terms: 
> 
> - "(Sim)" refers to the simulation results. This column reports the change caused by the simulation scenario you've run in the model. This can mean different things depending on the measure reported, such as change in GDP or sectoral output.
> 
> - "Pre" refers to the pre-simulation level of the variable. This is typically a base level or baseline condition against which the changes induced by the scenarios are measured.
> 
> - "Post" refers to the post-simulation level of the variable. This means the level of the variable after the scenario has been run. It's the state of the world (in the model) after the economic shocks you've introduced.
> 
> These results let you understand the magnitude of changes caused by the scenarios you've run in the model, by comparing the pre-simulation and post-simulation values.
