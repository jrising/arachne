> Goal and Objectives
> 
> 
> The NOWASTING project aims to improve the capacity of small-holder farmers and fishers in Nigeria and Senegal in mitigating, and in being resilient and adaptive to, the impacts of climate change in its effects on their production activities, nutrition, food security, and health. This project will commit to actively engage with and benefit stakeholders.
> 
> 
> Who may benefit/use from the research - Stakeholders include policymakers, government ministries, NGOs, research institutions and small-holder farmers and fishers in Nigeria and Senegal, local communities, and the broader public
> How may they benefit - to support stakeholders in their decision-making, and build local capacity to inform and design policies and practices regarding the impacts of climate change on  food security, nutrition and health outcomes.
> How will stakeholders be engaged - Engage stakeholders continuously during the duration of this project and at all levels to co-create solutions and ensure the relevance and feasibility of project outcomes, as detailed in section 1 of this document, and foster collaborations and partnerships for sustainability and long-term impact beyond the project lifespan, as discussed in sections 3 and 7.
> The methods for dissemination - Disseminate project findings and policy recommendations to stakeholders,  policymakers, practitioners, and the  public. We will develop and utilize tools, datasets, and models as detailed in sections 2 and 4 of this document.
> 
> 
> 1. Stakeholder Engagement
> 
> 
> NOWASTING is a stakeholder-driven project, aimed at supporting small-holder farmers and fishers with salient data, accessible tools, and local capacity-building. Stakeholder engagement ensures that the research is grounded in real-world contexts, aligns with stakeholder needs, and maximizes the chances of uptake and implementation. The core stakeholder engagement activities are described in WP1. WP1 will serve to document the outcomes from the meetings with  the broader community  associated with our work, which will be crucial for the development of the other WPs of this project. Some of the main aims are, first, to learn about  producers’ activities and drivers of their decision making,  and co-develop new mitigation and adaptation practices through decision-science approaches that could benefit them; and second, to learn about the stakeholders’ health challenges resulting from inadequate food security.
> 
> The NOWASTING project emphasizes active engagement with stakeholders who stand to benefit from the research. Beneficiaries include small-holder farmers and fishers, local communities, policymakers, NGOs, research institutions, and the general public.
> Engagement methods will include tailored workshops, training sessions, and the provision of decision-support tools to enable users to visualize and understand the implications of climate change on food security and nutrition. 
> 
> 
> The Food Security Futures Explorer will serve as a direct interface for users to simulate scenarios and strategies for resilience. See Section 2 below for details.
> 
> 
> Our stakeholder engagement strategy includes the following:
> 
> 
> Problem Identification Workshops: Involve users in identifying local challenges and co-developing research questions. Organize stakeholder workshops and forums to facilitate collaboration, build trust, and co-design project activities. Engage representatives from food-insecure communities, small-holder producers, fisher groups, food supply chain firms, and local/national government.
> Co-creation of Scenarios: Collaborate with stakeholders to develop plausible future climate and socio-economic scenarios, reflecting local contexts and addressing real-world risks and opportunities.
> Training and Capacity Building: Equip users with the necessary skills to interpret data and apply tools developed by the project.
> Regular Updates and Feedback Mechanisms: Use newsletters, web platforms, and stakeholder meetings to provide project updates and gather input to refine our tools and approach. Establish regular communication channels with stakeholders, such as community advisory boards and periodic meetings, to maintain engagement, gather feedback, and ensure continued co-design and adaptation.
> 
> 
> 2. Tools and Dataset Development
> 
> NOWASTING aims to provide accessible tools, datasets, and models that support evidence-based decision-making, enhance understanding, and foster local capacity-building. Key considerations for tools and dataset development include:
> 
> 
> Food Security Futures Explorer: Develop an interactive online platform that integrates project data, including climate projections, crop suitability, fishery productivity, production-consumption gaps, and nutritional content and gaps and potential impact on health. The Explorer will enable stakeholders to simulate different scenarios, assess risks, and explore adaptation options.
> Data Accessibility: Ensure open access to all project datasets and models through an online repository, enabling researchers and stakeholders to access and use the information for their own analyses and applications.
> Local Capacity-building: Design training programs, workshops, and webinars aimed at empowering stakeholders, researchers, and students in the use and interpretation of the tools, datasets, and models developed within the project.
> 
> 
> All of the results produced by the project will be made available online, as downloadable datasets and visualizations. Future projections will be made at high resolution and through 2050. See the Data Management Plan for a summary of these outputs.
> Ocean observations are crucial for informing vulnerable populations about how their livelihoods can be affected (directly and indirectly) by the increasing pressures facing the oceans. This will be also useful for contributing further the relevant stakeholders’ abilities to predict and adapt to such pressures, especially those caused by climate change and human activity.
> 
> Because of the many dimensions of this data, users need tools to explore and understand it. The Food Security Futures Explorer will be the central tool for sharing data and visualizations, and will feature interactive tools to engage a broader audience and inform policy and behavior. The interface will be co-created to support stakeholders in developing resilience to production, nutrition, and health risks. The tool will contain extensive information about adverse environmental changes to serve as an early warning system and for evaluating stakeholder adaptation options. The Explorer will Integrate sustainability and economic outputs into the model to guide producers in their decision-making, and to inform consumers about the effect of climate change on food production, nutrition and health.
> 
> 3. Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing
> 
> Capacity building is a key aspect of creating long-term impact and ensuring the continuity of the project’s outcomes. NOWASTING will support capacity-building and knowledge sharing under two main avenues. First, we will educate stakeholders and young scientists about the modeling of the relationship between climate change, the biology of fisheries and food crop production, and humans’ economic decisions, and the implications for nutrition and health. This will be done through workshops, training through teaching and research, and webinars at institutions in Senegal and Nigeria to share knowledge, improve capacity, and foster collaborations. This will enable communities to mitigate, anticipate and dynamically adapt to changing ocean boundaries.
