**assistant**:
> The xarray DataArray containing the string-like object is a numpy.ndarray under the hood, specifically numpy 'U' type (Unicode string). To extract the actual string data from it, you should `.values` property of the DataArray. After that, you can apply `re.split()`:
> 
> Here is an example:
> 
> ```python
> import re
> 
> # Let's assume you have the string-like object as follows
> string_object = ds.seg_adm[0]
> 
> # You extract the actual string value using `.values`
> string_value = string_object.values
> 
> # Now, you can apply `re.split()`
> split_result = re.split(pattern, string_value)  # replace 'pattern' with your actual regex pattern 
> ```
> 
> If you have a larger array of strings in your xarray dataset and want to apply `re.split()` to all of them, you could use the `.apply()` method:
> 
> ```python
> ds['seg_adm'].values = np.vectorize(lambda x: re.split(pattern, x))(ds['seg_adm'].values) 
> ```
> 
> This line creates a new 'seg_adm' data variable in your xarray Dataset where each string data has been split as per the regex pattern.
