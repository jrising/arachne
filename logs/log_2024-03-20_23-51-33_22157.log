> If I have 483 GtCO2 as the total carbon budget, and there are 7.9 billion people in the world, how much does each person get?
**assistant**:
> You can perform the calculation by dividing the total carbon budget by the current world population. Specifically:
> 
> 483 gigatons of CO₂ (or 483 billion tons) equals 483,000,000,000 tons. 
> 
> Therefore, each person's share of the carbon budget, assuming equal distribution, would be:
> 
> 483,000,000,000 tons / 7,900,000,000 people ≈ 61.14 tons CO₂ per person.
> 
> So, if the carbon budget were to be distributed equally among all people, each person would be allotted approximately 61.14 tons of CO₂.
