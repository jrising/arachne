> IMT will continue to serve as the leading expert on building performance standards and other building improvement policies. Our team is slated to present our thought leadership through at dozens of national conferences, including Greenbuild 2024, the Getting to Zero Forum, and ACEEE Summer Study, where we will present four papers. Paper topics include green leasing, implementing BPS on the ground, tenant protections in the context of building performance policy in California (co-presented with Strategic Actions for a Just Economy), and equitable building decarbonization options in a changing legal landscape (co-presented with Public Health Law Center). Additionally, we will expand our presence beyond industry publications and audiences by speaking at more than 50 events in the next year and continuing to build reporter relationships with Bloomberg publications, Grist, Axios, and others with a wider reach across our target audiences."

> IMT, a leading authority on building performance standards, plans to maintain and extend its influence through multiple avenues. It will present its insights at several key conferences, such as Greenbuild 2024, the Getting to Zero Forum, and ACEEE Summer Study, where it will table four papers. The papers will cover an array of topics including green leasing, BPS implementation, tenant protections in California's building performance policy, and fair decarbonization options in evolving legal settings. To further amplify their impact, not only will the team be assertively increasing their event count to over 50 in the coming year, but they also plan to develop their rapport with leading media outlets like Bloomberg, Grist, and Axios, aiming for a broader audience reach.
