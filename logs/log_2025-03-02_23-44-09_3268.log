**user**:
> Below is my assessment of an ongoing grant project:
> ===
> 2.1 Objectives and work plan
> Is the progress in line with work plan as specified in the DoA? If there are significant deviations, please comment.
> Please split this section into two parts.
> 1. Objectives (this part is a bit repetitive with section 2.1 (question 1), it should be more detailed here and more general above):
> •	Assess to what extent the objectives of the project as described in the DoA have been achieved.
> •	In particular, indicate if the project as a whole has been making satisfactory progress in relation to what was described in the DoA. 
> 2. Work packages: For each work package (WP):
> •	Assess the progress in relation to the DoA (including the achievement of deliverables and milestones).
> •	Comment on any significant deviation and/or delays, the reasons for them and corrective action taken.
> 
> On both points, more information will be provided in the periodic report.	Yes
> The deliverables and achieved milestones closely follow the specifications in the DoA, despite some identified deviations.
> 1. Objectives
> Progress is being made toward O1, although (1) the concrete incorporation of stakeholder co-creation input and (2) the reporting of distributional consequences needs to be further developed. (1) There is an apparent lack of integration between stakeholder activities and modelling. This is further discussed under deliverable D1.3. (2) It is understood that distributional aspects are to be developed under T4.2.
> Appropriate plans are in evidence to achieve O2, O3, and O4.
> The success of O5 will depend upon effective stakeholder co-creation of the project outputs. There is evidence of continued interaction with deep engagement stakeholders, in addition to the co-design workshop. However, it is hoped that concrete pathways of uptake would be identified through these interactions by this point in the project, and those are not enumerated.
> 2. Work packages:
> The stock-take in D1.1 has multiple identified gaps, and a lack of general synthesis of the various physical impacts, economic impacts, and adaptation costs and benefits.
> The content in D1.3 raises questions about the extent to which stakeholder concerns are allowed to direct the work of the project. More needs to be done to justify the many cases where partner questions which are not considered priorities by stakeholders are given precedence over those that are priorities.
> Some of the modelling assumptions used in D2.2 may have significant implications for the usefulness of these results to stakeholders. More information should be provided on modelling assumptions, and in many cases, comparative evaluations between modelling assumptions are needed.
> A revision is requested of D2.3 to address a number of methodological points, including choices around weather hazards, econometric controls, and the cost-benefit analysis of AC subsides.
> D2.3 has not assessed health impacts of extreme flood events. This was previously identified as critical implementation risk 8, with a mitigation action of drawing on other estimates for similar regions. This mitigation action has not been performed. In the absence of internal estimates, a systematic review of the literature is needed to identify appropriate estimates and the limitations of the existing knowledge base, and to apply the estimates to the extent possible.
> A revision is requested for D5.2. While a broad range of activities are described, key information on audiences and a pathway to the general public by way of stakeholders are missing.
> The progress toward other deliverables is appropriate.
> Are the objectives of the project still scientifically, technologically and economically relevant?
> Assess whether the project continues to be scientifically, technologically and economically relevant.
> Indicate whether the objectives are still relevant and ambitious (i.e. provide exceptional ground-breaking R&I, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models), and whether they are still achievable within the time and resources available. 
> Assess also whether the approach and methodology continue to be relevant.
> Please split this section into 2 sub-sections as per the general instructions:
> 1. Relevance of the project and of its objectives.
> •	Please provide here a general assessment on objectives.
> More information will be provided in the periodic report. The consortium is requested to report progress per objective with references to project's achievements.
> 
> 2. Relevance of the approach and methodology.
> Please check the methodology of the project as per DoA and based on the results achieved, assess whether the approach and methodology are still relevant.	Yes 
> [insert comments to justify the answer]
> 1. Relevance of the project and its objectives.
> If anything, adaptation in the EU has become an even more pressing issue, and actionable information on adaptation costs and benefits is central to effective policy-making. The high-resolution results provided by the project, well-grounded in the frontier of knowledge, are an excellent and essential component of this.
> 2. Relevance of the approach and methodology.
> The impact assessments draw upon both state-of-the-art process-based models, and effective econometric approaches. The adaptation strategy process (D3.1) is also state-of-the-art. The SSP-based scenarios and adaptation storylines used are appropriate for this kind of work. 
> Critical risks
> •	Are the critical implementation risks described in the DoA still relevant?
> •	Have new critical implementation risks been identified?
> •	Have the relevant risks been properly mitigated with adequate measures?
> Please see the information provided in the periodic report.	Yes 
> Three critical risks materialised, and one of these (Risk No. 8) has resulted in a deviation from the DoA. Of the remaining risks that could still emerge, Risk Nos 5 and 6 required continued watching.
> Risk No 5: Integration across methodologies is essential for the success of the project. Although pre-emptive mitigation planning has been performed, new problems may emerge when the actual integration is needed. 
> Risk No. 6: Some (but not all) key outputs from WP2 have already been provided, but outputs from WP3 are still needed. The success of WP4 depends on these inputs, and minor delays that have already occurred could push the work further back.
> Does the project respect the ‘do no significant harm’ principle? 
> Assess, where relevant, if the project methodology complies with the ‘do no significant harm’ principle set out in Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation No 2020/852, i.e. that it is designed in a way to not significantly harm any of the following six environmental objectives :
> 	climate change mitigation
> 	climate change adaptation
> 	sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
> 	transition to a circular economy
> 	pollution prevention and control
> 	protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.	Yes 
> Existing outputs are informational, and implicitly respect the “do no significant harm” principle. The adaptation case studies appear to respect this principle, however the changing of stakeholders in the deviations under T3.2 may justify a closer look.
> Is the gender dimension appropriately taken into account?
> Assess how the gender dimension (i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s research and innovation content. If the project has considered that the gender dimension is not relevant, assess whether the justification provided in the proposal is still relevant. 
> Note: Here ‘sex and/or gender dimension’ refers to the subject of the project, not to the researchers involved.
> Please check DoA (Part B) and any relevant deliverables tackling this point. The consortium was asked to report on this in the periodic report. 	Partially 
> Gender is sometimes taken into consideration in the analyses (e.g., heatwaves on economic wellbeing), but it is limited to a control variable. Climate impacts are differential by gender, given both the distributions of exposure and vulnerability, and this is an important point to be considered. The DoA specifies that gender will be considered explicitly in socioeconomic impacts, but this is not described sufficiently in the deliverables.
> The gender ratio across researchers is excellent, and the level of resources is appropriately distributed, but is not clear how this translates to how gender dimensions are captured in the project’s research.
> Does the project respect the commitments concerning open science as described in the DoA? Is it undertaking additional open science practices? 
> Assess the extent to which the project has engaged in the open science practices described in the DoA.
> In addition, assess whether the project has engaged in additional open science practices. 
> Such practices may include: 
> 	early and open sharing of research (for example, through pre-registration, registered reports, pre-preprints or crowd-sourcing)
> 	research data deposited in trusted repositories federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)
> 	for research outputs other than publications and data: research output management in line with FAIR
> 	for research outputs other than publication and data: deposition in trusted repositories and granting them open access 
> 	actions with regards to enhancing the reproducibility of results 
> 	participation in open peer review actions
> 	involvement of relevant knowledge actors, including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents	Yes 
> Open Science practices are embedded in ACCREU. However, there are some considerations to be watched in future evaluations. First, most data remains unavailable, and will only be released with publications. It is important, then, that publications are achieved across the full range of data and in a timely manner. Second, the DoA mentioned significant data being provided on stakeholder engagement. This is not currently evidenced.
> Is the project adequately integrating social sciences or/and humanities? (for SSH topics)
> Assess if the project has adequately engaged in an effective integration of social sciences or/and humanities, as outlined in the DoA. If only partially or not at all, does the project provide an acceptable justification and corrective measures?
> Note: Projects funded under SSH-flagged topics should show an effective integration of social sciences or/and humanities, unless justified in the proposal that these disciplines are not relevant for the project.	Yes 
> The main social science/humanity contribution described in the DoA is through economics. This is being adequately incorporated into results. The DoA does mention engaging with political science, but this is not currently evidenced. Other humanities which could be helpful in achieving project goals are not identified in the DoA.
> Have the ethics/security deliverables due for the current period been adequately addressed and approved?
> The proposal was ethics and security cleared (i.e., no significant ethics issues were recognised). Regardless, some ethics issues concerning involvement of humans (e.g. participation in project events, stakeholder workshops, case studies) and processing of their personal data (e.g. through surveys), and involvement of non-EU countries (UK and Vietnam with potentially some benefit-sharing actions, e.g. data sharing, import/export).
> DoA (Part B) and D6.1 tackle these issues, and more information might be provided in the periodic report. I don’t expect to you to go into much detail here, however, based on your best knowledge, please assess if the project is sufficiently addressing ethics issues and record here if some of the activities raise your concerns in terms of ethics and security issues.

> 2.2 Impact
> Is the proposed pathway to achieve the expected outcomes and impacts still credible?
> Please list the expected outcomes and impacts as per DoA (Part B) and provide your assessment for each expected impact (and related outcomes) as per general instructions.
> •	Assess the credibility of the expected outcomes and impacts in terms of scientific, economic/technological and societal aspects. 
> •	Assess whether there is any potential negative environmental outcome or impact of the project, including when expected results are brought at scale (such as at commercial level) and, if yes, whether the project proposes how to manage this.
> Note that more information will be provided in the periodic report which should help you in the preparation of your assessment.	Yes 
> EO1: Appropriate progress is being made toward this EO.
> EO2: Both sudden onset events and slow onset processes are being considered across the WP2 impact assessments. However, in many cases, impacts susceptible to both sudden and slow processes are not both considered. For example, health and wellbeing results rely upon econometric methods, which largely describe the effects of shocks. Natural disasters (e.g., as described in EM-DAT) are generally not being studied.
> EO3: Appropriate progress is being made toward this EO.
> EO4: Appropriate progress is being made toward this EO.

> How will the project have an impact on policy making (if any)?
> Assess whether:
> •	The project results or activities will contribute to designing, monitoring, reviewing and adjusting (if necessary) existing policy and programmatic measures or 
> •	Whether the project will contribute to shaping and supporting the implementation of new policy initiatives and decisions, (e.g. healthcare, transport, environment, energy, migration, regional development, etc.) by supporting policy implementation, policy stakeholder engagement or exploring new technological approaches for policy objectives. 
> When writing your assessment, please be specific about which policies were addressed and how well, and provide recommendations if any.
> More information will be provided in the periodic report, however, some information might be extracted from some deliverables.	Yes 
> Please indicate the EU headline priorities to which the project has contributed or will contribute to. 
> The project was requested to address in the periodic report how it contributes to the headline priorities.
> Please assess the progress of the project to contribute to the priorities (also against the DoA). The most relevant is the European Green Deal, while others (may) have less importance in project’s context.
> However, if you see other priorities are relevant and the project contributes to any (or could/should contribute to), please mention it. Other EU priorities are not so relevant for this project but if you see any other  or other listed here.	European Green Deal
> 
> The project has contributed to Horizon destination 1. Stakeholders have stated that ACCREU results are expected to provide input to local, national, and EU-level policy making.
> However, as described above, using the connection with stakeholders to identify concrete pathways for impact is essential and not currently shown.
> Are the measures to maximise impact still suitable? (n/a for EIC Pathfinder)
> Please check DoA (Part B), section 2.2, tasks in relevant WPs and any relevant deliverables submitted
> •	Assess whether the planned measures to maximise the impact as set up in the plan for the dissemination and exploitation including communication activities are proportionate to the scale of the project, and contain concrete actions to be implemented both during and after the end of the project, e.g. standardisation activities.
> Are the measures for public/stakeholder engagement properly implemented?
> Are the measures for raising awareness about the project outputs/outcomes, including through open science, efficient?
> Are the exploitation measures to facilitate translation of research results into innovations with societal or economic impact are effective (i.e. end-users testing and industrial design, IPR and freedom to operate, standardisation, regulation …)?
> •	Assess whether why each measure chosen is best suited to reach the target group addressed. Are the measures still realistic and achievable. Please provide recommendations on the adjustments to the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities.
> •	Where relevant, and for innovation actions, include in your assessment the measures for a plausible path to commercialise the innovations. This is a research and innovation action (RIA). Nevertheless, please provide your assessment whether commercialisation of project’s outputs is plausible (is it foreseen in the exploitation plan?). Provide recommendations if any.	Partially 
> As described elsewhere, there is a concern that stakeholders have not been provided with concrete ways to shape the project, and as a result the outcomes remain traditionally academic. The project does not set out sufficiently concrete ways that stakeholder opinions will be incorporated, or how ACCREU outputs will be shaped to maximise impact through these stakeholders.

> This information is (will be) provided in the periodic report. Please focus here on the effort (person-months) reported are reasonable and in line with the performed work (see descriptions of the WPs in the periodic report).
> Please report any issues at project or partner level.	Yes 
> Resources appear to be appropriately distributed across the consortium partners, consistent with their planned contributions to the project and the stage of work they are in. The one exception is the funding provided to the Cyprus Institute, which is comparatively high for its level of contribution. Cyl is leading one task, but has over the median level of resources, and has a funding level nearly as high as some of the work package leaders. However, since this is a Hop On member, which presumably came with additional resources through that process, it is not a barrier to achieving the project goals.

> **Executive Summary**
> 
> The ACCREU project has made significant strides toward achieving its key objectives, as outlined in the Description of Action (DoA), with notable progress in developing actionable information on adaptation costs and benefits. Various work packages (WPs) have successfully delivered on their milestones and deliverables, showcasing a strong adherence to the original work plan. The project's impactful contributions are particularly evident in the development of high-resolution impact assessments, which are crucial for informing EU policy-making, especially aligned with the European Green Deal.
> 
> However, the project faces some challenges that need to be addressed for its continued success. The incorporation of stakeholder co-creation into the research framework remains an area needing further development. The lack of integration between stakeholder activities and modeling efforts is notable, as is the need for clearer pathways for translating research into concrete policy actions. Additionally, several deliverables, such as D2.3 and D5.2, require revisions to address methodological concerns and to enhance stakeholder engagement.
> 
> The project's methodology, drawing from state-of-the-art models and econometric approaches, remains highly relevant and continues to support the project's goals. Yet, there is a critical need to maintain vigilance over identified risks, such as delays in WP3 outputs and integration challenges, which could impact the timelines and success of subsequent work. The project has encountered deviations from the DoA, such as in assessing health impacts of extreme flood events, which prompt the need for mitigation measures.
> 
> The socio-economic dimensions, including gender considerations, have been partially integrated into the project's analysis, though improvements are necessary to fully meet the commitments outlined in the DoA. Open science practices are embedded, yet the release of data remains tied to pending publications, highlighting the need for timely dissemination to maximize impact.
> 
> Despite these challenges, the project remains scientifically, technologically, and economically relevant, with continued potential to influence policy-making at various levels. To fully realize this potential, focused efforts on stakeholder engagement and the presentation of research outputs in a manner accessible to policymakers are essential. The project's management practices have been effective, ensuring resource allocation aligns with planned contributions and project stages.
> 
> This summary outlines the project's achievements, current challenges, and strategic areas for improvement, with further details provided in the subsequent sections of this report.
