> ---
> Jim Pappas- DelDOT Director of Transportation and Resiliency and Sustainability
> Degree in Engineering and MBA of Environmental Sustainability
> Project Link: https://deldot.gov/projects/Studies/sr1-coastal-corridor/
> The division was created about 2 years ago after increasing frequency and severity of flooding. Previously there were a couple people working on resiliency issues in addition to their other jobs within DelDOT. The Cabinet Secretary for the State recognized a need to have a full time team working on the problem as the impacts were getting worse and wanted to take advantage of the availability of federal funding. The division is now Jim (Director) and an Assistant Director and a number of consultants.
> Currently the division is working on a planning project to address flooding issues with Route 1 (SR1). They received a grant through FEMA to do a resiliency planning study for a 16 miles stretch of SR1 between Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island to determine what the best option was moving forward. SR1 sees a lot of flooding and so far DelDOT has been able to keep it open to at least emergency vehicles during flooding events, but that may not be the case in the future. Alternative evacuation routes add an additional hour to the trip which is not feasible in an emergency situation. The project is currently in the public meeting phase. They have had two public meetings and there has been unanimous agreement that something needs to be done for SR1 and the other roads used as evacuation routes. In addition to public meetings DelDOT is meeting with each of the towns (mayors, town manager, police, etc) to ensure that their opinions are heard. There will also be a public survey to collect information on what segment of the 16 mile stretch is the most important and should be prioritized first. The idealized end of the project is something that best incorporates the needs of DelDOT (the transportation needs of the state) in addition to the needs of the communities. The solution needs to be “context sensitive”. One proposed solution was flood walls, but the communities were against that idea because it hurts the aesthetics of the area. 
> Within the state, flooding is the biggest impact from climate change. Delaware is the lowest lying state in the country and has to deal with tidal/sunny day flooding in addition to short term/ high intensity storm events. There are communities in Kent County that only have one road in or out that floods daily. DelDOT has raised some of those roads as well as ones in Sussex County that flood consistently but that is not a long term solution and will not completely solve the problem. There is some concern about extreme heat on people and pavement, but that is considered minor and has not affected anything like flooding has. 
> Sussex County and the beaches are a major concern considering the number of tourists that frequent the area. Tourists will follow the evacuation routes and will be less likely to know the roads to go around if an evacuation route is also flooded. The alternate routes to SR1 (Routes 24 and 20) also flood. Having to deal with an increased number of people who aren’t familiar with the area is a concern for DelDOT during an emergency flooding event. Other concerns during a flooding event include access for emergency services and the ability of fire trucks or ambulances to get into and out of the area to help people. 
> The potential barriers for the project are community involvement, coordination of utilities, the possibility of needing to purchase private property to adjust the right of way, and the permitting process through DENRC or the Army Corps. Designing the plan on paper is the easy part. DelDOT has to coordinate with all of the utility companies in the area to ensure they don’t disrupt service and this can take time to figure out. Permitting is also difficult and can take a lot of time before any project can begin. Getting the right of way by purchasing private property or by condemning a property is also time-consuming and can be held up by lawsuits.

> Did Jim say anything about the need to prioritize which roads are elevated?  This could be an implication for the coastal economy as it is not likely that DelDOT can address flooding on all roads.  Also, did Jim have any stats for how much $ it would take to elevate or make resilient the vulnerable roads in the coastal region?
**assistant**:
> From the notes provided, Jim Pappas did discuss the need for strategic prioritization of flood responses, but did not specifically mention a plan to prioritize which roads would be elevated. He stated that a public survey will be employed to understand which segment of the 16-mile stretch is deemed most important and should be prioritized first. Recognizing the realities of limited resources, this implies that some form of prioritization must be done across the infrastructure network in Delaware.
> 
> However, there is no mention of any specific statistical information regarding the costs associated with elevation or resilience enhancement of the vulnerable roads. Such specific information might require detailed study and calculation that goes beyond the scope of this particular interview. If you're interested, I could search for related studies or initiatives to get a rough estimate of the potential cost.
> 
> Given the significant communal, logistical, and environmental complexities of these issues—as noted by the barriers outlined by Jim—such as coordinating utilities, acquiring right of way, and getting necessary permits, the process of creating resilience in the DelDOT infrastructure is likely to be a multi-faceted and costly endeavor. Ultimately, the cost would depend on the specifics of the chosen solutions for each area under consideration.
