> How can I calculate "expenditure share" from an MRIO matrix?
**assistant**:
> In an Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model, the "expenditure share" is calculated as the amount a region spends on an item (or items) compared to its total expenditure. Let's assume that the MRIO matrix is `mrio_mat`, where the rows are the regions and columns are the items. Here's how you can calculate expenditure share:
> 
> 1. Sum each region's total expenditure:
>     ```julia
>     total_expenditure = sum(mrio_mat, dims=2)  # For each region, dims=2 sums over columns
>     ```
> 
> 2. Now that you have the total expenditure for each region, calculate the expenditure share for each item. Let's say you want to find the expenditure share of item 'X'. Identify the corresponding column in your MRIO matrix, call it `item_X`:
>     ```julia
>     can_expenditure_on_X = mrio_mat[.,item_X]  # Index all rows for the item 'X' column
>     ```
> 3. The expenditure share can then be computed as:
>     ```julia
>     share = can_expenditure_on_X ./ total_expenditure
>     ```
> 
> This gives you the expenditure share of item 'X' for each region. You can repeat this for all items you're interested in, and for each region. The result will be a ratio between 0 and 1, and you can multiply by 100 if you prefer expressing as a percentage. Remember to replace `item_X` with the appropriate column numbers for different items.
