> In google sheets, is there a way I can take a minimum of a column, where the column is specified by an index (a number I have in a formula)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can achieve this by combining the `INDEX` function with the `MIN` function in Google Sheets. Here's a step-by-step guide:
> 
> 1. **Identify the row and column ranges:** Make sure you know the range of your data and which row contains the headers (if any).
> 
> 2. **Use the `INDEX` function to specify the column:** Use the `INDEX` function with the column index to reference the column you want.
> 
> 3. **Apply the `MIN` function:** Apply the `MIN` function to the dynamic column reference obtained from the `INDEX` function.
> 
> Assuming your data range is in `A1:Z100` and the column index (number) is in cell `B1`, the formula would look something like this:
> 
> ```plaintext
> =MIN(INDEX(A1:Z100, 0, B1))
> ```
> 
> - `A1:Z100` is the entire range of your data.
> - `INDEX(A1:Z100, 0, B1)` dynamically selects the entire column specified by the index in `B1`.
> - `MIN` then finds the minimum value in that specified column.
> 
> ### Example
> 
> 1. If `B1` contains the number `3` and your data range is `A1:Z100`:
>     - `INDEX(A1:Z100, 0, B1)` references the entire third column, which would be column `C`.
> 
> 2. The `MIN` function applied to this range will give you the minimum value in column `C`.
> 
> Feel free to adjust the range `A1:Z100` and the cell reference `B1` according to your specific use case. Let me know if you need any further clarification!
