>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

> Thank you for reaching out. It sounds like you would be good candidate for [PROGRAM]. However, funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds.

> I am Latifat Are-Kilanse, an Environment, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) consultant and research analyst at one of the top financial advisory firms in Nigeria. As an ESG consultant, I conduct qualitative and applied research on market trends and the performance of sustainable finance and green investment in the global economy, as well as on the impact of sustainable practices on business performance. I also provide advisory services to assist organizations on how to comply with International Sustainability Guidelines such as GRI Standards and the IFC’s Environmental and Social (E&S) Performance and profitably integrate sustainable practices into their operations towards actualising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

> I thoroughly read your profile and publications, and I found your research interests to be very intriguing and engaging. I was particularly captivated by your work on the impact of climate change, especially your publication titled “Estimating Economic Damage from Climate Change in the United States”. I discovered a correlation between our research interests, as I am also interested in investing in the economic implications of a transition to renewable energy for industrial production. I also find very impressive one of the major contributions of this paper to existing studies, which is the construction of a system architecture called the Spatial Empirical Adaptive Global-to-Local Assessment System (SEAGLAS) to compute and evaluate the impact of climate change in specific sectors of the economy.
> 
> Hence, given the foundation provided by your studies in the assessment of the impact of climate change, I intend to extend your contribution to the existing study by adopting and expanding on the SEAGLAS architecture to rigorously examine the economic impact of abating greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning towards renewable energy on the productivity of the industrial sectors.
> 
> In preparation for my application to the graduate program in environmental economics, I would like to know if you are accepting graduate students for the Fall 2024 academic session and to express my interest in becoming a member of your team.
> 
> Please, find attached to this email a copy of my CV and academic transcript.
> 
> I'm looking forward to your feedback and will also be available for a virtual chat if you'd like to have one scheduled to further discuss the synergy in our research interests.

> Thank you.

> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> It seems Latifat Are-Kilanse is interested in exploring the economic implications of a transition to renewable energy for industrial production, which aligns with your research on climate change risks and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. She expressed an interest in the graduate program in Environmental Economics and asked if you are accepting graduate students for the Fall 2024 academic session.
> 
> The email did not provide any clear indication as to whether she is from the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area or has completed her studies at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD. Considering her professional experience as an ESG consultant and research analyst, she appears to be well-qualified for the field she intends to study.
> 
> The Ph.D. in Environmental Economics seems most suitable for her, given her expressed research interests and your available supervision. However, be mindful to highlight that the program has limited funding and she should mention you in her Statement of Purpose to strengthen her application. It may also be worth suggesting the self-funded EE Masters as a potential alternative.
> 
> Here's a draft email response:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Latifat,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your experience and research interests indeed align quite well with the graduate program in Environmental Economics here at the University of Delaware. I appreciate your interest in my work and your intention to expand on our SEAGLAS architecture seems intriguing.
> 
> Currently, the enrolment for the fall 2024 academic session is not yet clear, but your strong background certainly makes you a good candidate. However, with limited funding, it's always advisable to apply as early as possible.
> 
> Considering your previous research and your professional experience as an ESG consultant, you may prefer our Ph.D. program. If you decide to apply, I encourage you to mention this correspondence and your research alignment with me in your Statement of Purpose. 
> 
> Alternately, we also have a Masters in Environmental Economics which is completely self-funded and could also align well with your interests. 
> 
> I hope this information was helpful in getting a clearer picture. Feel free to reach out should you need any additional information.
