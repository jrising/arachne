> When I/O modelers talk about indirect effects for a change to an industry (e.g., that industry growing by $1), do they mean effects on suppliers (upstream) or consuming industries (downstream)?

> Input-Output (I/O) modelers typically refer to both upstream and downstream effects when they talk about indirect effects of a change in an industry.
> 
> 1. **Upstream effects**: These are the effects on industries that provide inputs to the industry experiencing the change. For instance, if the automobile industry grows, there can be an increased demand for steel, rubber, and other inputs, leading to growth in those supplier industries. This is often referred to as the "indirect effect" in I/O modeling.
> 
> 2. **Downstream effects**: These are the effects on industries that use the outputs of the industry experiencing the change. For instance, if the steel industry grows, this could affect industries like construction or automobile manufacturing that use steel in their products. These are sometimes categorized as "induced effects" in I/O modeling, although this term more often refers to the effects of changes in household spending resulting from changes in incomes in the directly and indirectly affected industries.

> To put it succinctly, indirect effects in I/O models typically refer to changes in supplier industries (upstream), while induced effects can refer to changes in downstream industries and changes in consumption driven by changes in income. However, the specific use of these terms can vary somewhat depending on the context and the specific I/O model being used. It's always a good idea to clarify these definitions when working with a specific model or analysis.
