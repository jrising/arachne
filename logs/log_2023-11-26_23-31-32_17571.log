**user**:
> I have been asked to speak on the panel described below:
> Our theme is "Shifting Goals - What is the Ocean / Coast We Want?" and our goal is for everyone to tie your presentation to how social values, goals, objectives are identified (e.g., Emma - understanding what preferences people have through surveys or Christina using experiments to understand what people want, what goals are explicit or implicit), negotiated (how do we handle compromises and competing priorities, how do groups think about justice and power dynamics when setting goals); how goals change over time (and Kimberly on how adaptive governance can help address goals that change); and how practitioners and communities can work to do better in identifying, talking about, and balancing goals (e.g., Danielle talking about the role of RASCL in setting shared values and agendas). 
> 
> Here was another description of the panel:
> The United Nations Ocean Decade catchphrase is "the science we need for the ocean we want," but deciding who WE are and what we WANT is a difficult social science problem. Our event will highlight different ways of thinking about how social goals are negotiated and how they change. 
> 
> The topic I have been given is "challenges of cost benefit analysis and implicit goal setting in economic analyses". But I don't really know what this means and what points I should raise. I'm an environmental economist, and I'd like to think that I think broadly about issues, but most of my work takes CBA as a useful framework.
**assistant**:
> Given the topic and the goal of the panel, I can imagine you might discuss the following issues related to cost benefit analysis (CBA) and implicit goal setting:
> 
> 1. **Value Pluralism:** CBA, traditionally, is a singular metricâ€”a monist approach that often implicitly assumes maximum utility or economic efficiency as the primary goal. Challenge lies here as it sometimes overlooks the fact that different stakeholders might have various alternative goals (such as distributional equality, resilience, or sustainability) which can be equally or even more important than efficiency. 
> 
> 2. **Quantification**: One critical challenge of CBA is transforming various forms of values (social, environmental, cultural) into monetary units. While this can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, it can also omit non-quantifiable, yet valuable attributes, imposing an implicit goal of maximizing quantifiable benefits.
> 
> 3. **Distributive justice and power dynamics:** CBA aggregates the costs and benefits across different people, groups, or generations. By doing this, it implicitly assumes that the goal is to maximize the total welfare of the society, not considering how benefits or costs are distributed among distinct groups. This can obscure issues of injustice and inequalities, particularly if the winners from a given policy or decision have more power or resources.
> 
> 4. **Time Preference & Deep Uncertainty:** When dealing with long-term projects or policies (ex. climate change mitigation), CBA may implicitly favor immediate benefits and less distant future due to discounting. It also often struggles with deep uncertainties that come with these long-term decisions. 
> 
> 5. **Value Elicitation through contingent valuation surveys and stated preference methods**: These are ways economists often use to assign monetary value to non-market goods and services. However, concerns include: does the public have enough understanding about these complex environmental goods/services to value them properly? Are there cultural differences in how such goods/services are perceived and valued? Does the method of eliciting these values influence the results and hence the goals that are implied?
> 
> 6. **CBA as part of the democratic process**: While CBA can incorporate social values, its technocratic process may limit participatory democracy. In reality, goal-setting is not just about 'what' goals we set but also about 'how' we set these goals.
> 
> These points can lead back to the surrounding discussion of shifting social values, goals, and objectives in the context of the Ocean/Coast we want.
> 
> Does this help to clarify your topic and how you might approach it?
