> Can you suggest some multiple choice questions to see if they've done the reading?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are some multiple-choice questions to test your students' understanding of the reading:
> 
> **1. What was the estimated cod biomass on the Scotian Shelf in 1852 according to the study?**
> 
>    a) 5,000 metric tons  
>    b) 1.26 million metric tons  
>    c) 300,000 metric tons  
>    d) 50,000 metric tons  
> 
> **2. What primary sources did the researchers use to estimate historical cod biomass?**
> 
>    a) Satellite imagery  
>    b) New England fishing logs from the mid-19th century  
>    c) Scientific surveys from the 1980s  
>    d) Government reports from the 2000s  
> 
> **3. What concept does "shifting baselines syndrome" describe?**
> 
>    a) The increasing abundance of marine species over time  
>    b) The failure to accurately recall the original abundance and diversity of species  
>    c) The movement of fish stocks to different regions due to climate change  
>    d) The stabilization of fish populations due to conservation efforts  
> 
> **4. What fishing technique was primarily used by 19th-century schooners on the Scotian Shelf?**
> 
>    a) Longline fishing  
>    b) Handlining from the vessel  
>    c) Net trawling  
>    d) Spearfishing  
> 
> **5. According to the article, what do current policies potentially underestimate about fish stocks?**
> 
>    a) The importance of predator fish in the ecosystem  
>    b) The historical abundance and potential productivity of cod stocks  
>    c) The carrying capacity of modern fishing fleets  
>    d) The economic benefit of conserving depleted fisheries  
> 
> **6. What challenge does the historical perspective provide to modern views about cod stock rebuilding?**
> 
>    a) It suggests that cod cannot recover to historical levels due to climate change  
>    b) It indicates that previously considered "full recovery" levels are lower than historical productivity  
>    c) It shows that cod stocks have always been at current levels due to natural variability  
>    d) It argues that cod fishing should cease altogether  
> 
> **7. What conclusion do the authors draw from their historical analyses of cod populations?**
> 
>    a) Current cod biomass is near the historical average  
>    b) Cod populations have always fluctuated similarly to today  
>    c) Historical cod populations were significantly larger than those today  
>    d) Overfishing has had minimal impact on cod stocks in the long term  
>
