> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters. Please write a paragraph about disposal sites. It is accompanied by a map with data with following source description:
> ---
> These data show the location of available and discontinued ocean disposal sites within U.S. waters. Contemporary ocean disposal sites generally accept clean dredged material (sediment) collected during navigation channel improvement projects. These projects are sponsored or regulated by federal and state agencies. The terminology and practices used in ocean disposal have changed considerably over time. The values in the Primary Use field in this database show some of that variability.

> In the paragraph, note the following:
> Within the planning area, there are:
>  - Two active disposal sites with primary use = Littoral Placement Area
>  - 3 discontinued disposal sites
> Nearby, there is a Municipal sewage sludge dump site, a dredged material disposal site, and a site designed by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) (so these are all potential uses).

> In the planning area within Delaware's marine waters, there are two active disposal sites, termed as "Littoral Placement Area," which are primarily designed for depositing dredged sediments to aid efforts in shoreline maintenance and protection. The sediments placed in these areas are clean and sourced from navigation channel improvement projects, closely regulated by both state and federal agencies. Over time, however, the usage and practices within such disposal sites have evolved significantly, an aspect captured by the variation seen in the "Primary Use" field in the provided database. Besides these active sites, the area also holds three discontinued disposal sites that used to perform similar functions, but currently, are not in use. In the vicinity of the planning area, additional sites include a municipal sewage sludge dump site, a dredged material disposal site, and a site designated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). Each of these sites represents a different potential use that contributes to the overall complex picture of marine disposal activities within and around Delaware's waters.
