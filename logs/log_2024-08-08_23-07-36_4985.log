> The book you're thinking of is "The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them" by Elif Batuman. Though Elif Batuman is not a philosopher nor the head of the Boston Music Conservatory, her book indeed includes a mix of literary reflection and personal anecdote, exploring deep philosophical themes and curious practices in the realm of literature. The phrase "lessons in second fiddle" and "double-buttocked playing" are strong indicators of Batuman's distinctive and humorous narrative style.
