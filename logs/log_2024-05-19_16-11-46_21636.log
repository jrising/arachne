> I have a booklet that came with an "Imagine Ink" marker, but I've lost the marker. When you draw with the marker, different colors appear and they stay. I figured that it must be an acid or a base, because using straight water doesn't work. What can I do to replce the marker?
**assistant**:
> The "Imagine Ink" markers use a special ink technology, which is designed such that the marker is clear but it reacts with the special paper in the booklet to reveal the hidden colors. While the exact chemical composition isn't public, it is a safe assumption that they involve (harmless) acid-base reactions, just as you suspected.
> 
> While there isn't any exact household substitute for the "Imagine Ink" marker, you may try one of the closest alternative methods: a mixture involving baking soda and grape juice. The science behind this is also based on acid-base reactions. Baking soda is a base, while grape juice is acidic and changes color when it comes into contact with a base.
> 
> Here's what you can do:
> 
> 1. Mix water and baking soda at a ratio of about 2:1 (two parts baking soda to one part water).
> 2. Use a paintbrush, cotton swab, or even a non-permanent marker soaked in the mixture to draw on the booklet. Let it dry completely.
> 3. If you don't see any color changes, dab the areas where you drew with a cotton swab soaked in grape juice. 
> 
> Unfortunately, this method may not provide the same immediate and vibrant color changes as the original Imagine Ink marker. Furthermore, it likely won't work with the original Imagine Ink booklet because the printed materials in the booklet are designed to react specifically with the marker that comes with it.
