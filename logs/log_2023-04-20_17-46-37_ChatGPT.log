> I am deciding on 5 papers to send to external reviewers as part of a tenure packet for my work in quantitative environmental policy (I am mostly an environmental economist, but I publish frequently in general science journals). How should I think about the following trade-offs?
> 
>  - High-impact papers, where I am one of many co-authors; vs. low-impact, first-authored papers.
>  - Papers first-authored by advisees of mine, vs. my papers.
>  - Papers that show my breadth of interests, compared to ones that tell a coherent story.
**assistant**:
> It's important to strike a balance when selecting papers to include in your tenure packet. Each of the trade-offs you mentioned should be carefully considered to showcase your strengths and contributions to the field. Here are some suggestions on how to navigate these trade-offs:
> 
> 1. High-impact papers vs. low-impact, first-authored papers:
>    - Include a mix of both. High-impact papers demonstrate your ability to collaborate on significant research projects and show the broader impact of your work. These papers can help establish your reputation within the field. However, it's also important to include some first-authored papers, even if they are in lower-impact journals. These demonstrate your ability to lead a research project and contribute original ideas to the field. Balance is key here: try to select a combination of papers that demonstrates both your collaborative skills and your individual research capacity.
> 
> 2. Papers first-authored by advisees vs. your papers:
>    - The main goal is to showcase your contributions to the field, so prioritize papers in which you've played a significant role. However, if your advisees have published papers where you've made substantial contributions, consider including them as well. This demonstrates your effectiveness as a mentor and your ability to cultivate research talent, which are important qualities for a tenured faculty member.
> 
> 3. Papers showing breadth of interests vs. a coherent story:
>    - Strive for a balance between these two aspects. It's essential to show that you have a well-defined research agenda with a coherent story, as this will make your work more recognizable and increase your chances of being cited by others in the field. At the same time, displaying a certain level of breadth in your research interests can demonstrate your versatility and adaptability, which are valuable qualities in academia. When selecting papers, try to find a balance that communicates your core research interests while also demonstrating your ability to explore and contribute to a variety of topics within your field.
> 
> In summary, aim for a mix of papers that showcase your individual research contributions, mentorship, and collaboration skills, while presenting a coherent research narrative and highlighting your adaptability. This balanced approach will help demonstrate your value as a researcher and potential tenured faculty member to external reviewers.

> Are peer-reviewed perspectives or reviews good additions, or should their spots be used for lower-profile research papers?
**assistant**:
> Peer-reviewed perspectives or reviews can be valuable additions to your tenure packet, but they should not entirely replace research papers. Including a well-received perspective or review article can showcase your expertise in a particular area and demonstrate your ability to synthesize and communicate complex ideas to a broad audience. They can also highlight your impact on the field by showing your contributions to the larger intellectual discourse.
> 
> However, research papers are crucial to demonstrate your original research contributions and your ability to lead and execute projects independently or collaboratively. Since the primary focus of a tenure evaluation is your research productivity and impact, it's essential to prioritize research papers in your tenure packet.
> 
> A balanced approach is ideal. Consider including one or two high-quality perspectives or reviews that have received recognition within your field, in addition to your research papers. This will allow you to showcase your expertise and contributions to the field while also demonstrating your capacity to engage in various types of academic writing.
> 
> Ultimately, the specific mix of papers you include will depend on your unique research profile and career trajectory. Make sure to prioritize papers that best represent your strengths, showcase your research accomplishments, and align with the expectations of your department and institution.
