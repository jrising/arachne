> I am collaborating with a South Korean whose name is Dr. In Chang Hwang. Is it correct to refer to him as Dr. Hwang?
**assistant**:
> Yes, in both a Western and South Korean context, you would refer to him as Dr. Hwang. In Korea, the family name, which is Hwang in this case, comes first, and the given name, which is In Chang, comes second. Therefore, when addressing him formally, you would use his family name 'Hwang' preceded by the appropriate title, in this case, 'Dr.' So the correct form is Dr. Hwang.

> What is the right way to write 15 million units of Korean Won currency?
**assistant**:
> The correct way to write 15 million units of Korean Won currency is ₩15,000,000 or KRW 15,000,000. The symbol '₩' represents the South Korean Won currency, and 'KRW' is the internationally recognized currency code for the South Korean Won. Remember to include the commas for easier readability.
