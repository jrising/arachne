> Can you write a response, answering: 1 - 3 students per year, entirely dependent upon funding. We try to provide full funding to all students we accept, but given the challenges of securing funding, we have accepted self-funded students with the hope of closing the gap in future years.
> 
> We do not currently require a GRE, but we check GPA (> 3) and grades for calculus, statistics, and previous microeconomic courses (A to B preferred for all of these).

> 
> Dear Prodip Chakraborty,
> 
> Thank you for your interest in our Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics. I appreciate your inquiry and would be happy to provide you with more information about our admissions process.
> 
> Regarding your specific questions:
> - We typically admit between 1 to 3 students per year into our Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics. The exact number admitted can vary and is entirely dependent upon available funding.
> 
> - While we strive to provide full funding to all accepted students, securing funding can be challenging. As a result, we have, in the past, accepted self-funded students with the intention of closing the funding gap in future years.
> 
> - We do not currently require GRE scores for our program. Instead, we assess applicants based on their GPA (preferably above 3) and their grades in calculus, statistics, and previous microeconomic courses (ideally in the range of A to B).
> 
> If you have any further questions or would like more information, please feel free to reach out. We encourage you to submit your application by the designated deadline to be considered for our program.
