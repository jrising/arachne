>  Introduction
> There is currently an incredibly ambitious goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind
> energy within the USA by 2030 (White House, 2021). Many of these projects are concentrated within the Northeast Atlantic Coast, including a project on the Outer Continental Shelf offshore of Delaware. While onshore wind has been widespread since the 1970s, and offshore wind has been used at scale since the 1990s in Europe, the offshore technology is still technically new and novel in the USA (MacAskill & Mitchell, 2012). Although offshore wind has been deployed at high rates globally, an offshore wind project’s impacts to the marine environment remain uncertain.
> The inability for offshore wind developers and scientists to conclusively understand and communicate offshore wind impacts to marine life, specifically to marine mammals such as whales, has impacted stakeholder support of offshore wind projects. The potential consequences of offshore wind projects not reaching high levels of stakeholder support can be varied, ranging from irritated constituents to litigation that holds up project implementation, all the way to a project failing entirely or preventing future wind project approvals (Larson, 2011; Lhowe, 2023).
> In the northeast Atlantic, there are abundant whale populations that hold significant social capital to coastal communities, such as Humpback, Fin, Blue, Sperm, and North Atlantic right whales (NOAA, 2023). Of particular consequence to offshore wind (OSW) is the North Atlantic right whale (NARW), a whale whose population has been declining since 2010 and has been listed under the Endangered Species Act since 1970. Vulnerable to vessel strikes, fishing gear entanglement, and climate change, the NARW has been experiencing a documented unusual mortality event since 2017 (NOAA, 2023). The uncertainty of offshore wind’s impact on the NARW population could lead to different outcomes; stressors relating to offshore wind construction (e.g., noise pollution, construction vessel traffic) have the capacity to push an already struggling NARW population on the brink of collapse, or, the construction of offshore wind farms and the limiting of commercial and shipping vessel traffic along with limiting fishing could create a de facto marine protected area and the NARW population stabilizes as some key stressors decrease.
> Key questions this model seeks to answer are:
> I. Does the creation of an offshore wind farm in the Outer Continental Shelf offshore of
> Delaware lead to the population collapse of NARW?
> II. Considering a scenario where turbines stop being installed if stakeholder support reaches a
> low enough level, how many turbines out of the planned 98 will actually end up being built?
> Research Context
> While the Northeast US is often called the Nation’s leader in developing offshore wind
> power, mid-atlantic states are following suit by implementing their own offshore wind practices. Our study focuses on one project in particular, Ocean Wind 1, a 12 turbine, 1100 MW project scheduled for development 24.14 km off the coast of New Jersey.1 The Ocean Wind cable will make landfall in two locations: the BL sub station near Ocean City and Upper Township in north New Jersey (Appendix A). Ocean Wind is expected to provide clean energy to about 500,000 homes, with construction beginning in the fall of 2023 and plans to be fully operational by 2025.
> 1 In the middle of the semester, plans to develop Ocean Wind 1 were canceled. However, due to the timing of this paper deadline, we are proceeding as if this project were still going through.

>  Coastal areas affected by development include both urban and rural areas and are home to socio-economically diverse communities, allowing us to examine a wide range of stakeholder groups. These areas of the New Jersey coast also have robust commercial fishing economies. For example, New Jersey is one of the nation’s and the world’s leading suppliers of surf clams and ocean quahog, which brought in $10.9 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2013 (New Jersey Department of Agriculture, 2023).
> For this study, we used the lifespan of an offshore wind project as our model simulation length. The lifespan of an offshore wind turbine can be determined by a number of factors, including physical barriers, such as structural deterioration or material requirements, and economic or political factors, such as lease agreements and social opposition (Fishman and Graedel, 2019; Wiser and Bolinger, 2019). Lease agreements typically last 30 years in the US, so for the purposes of this study, 30 years will be our model length (BOEM, n.d.).
> Literature Review
> I. The Natural System
> A. North Atlantic Right Whales
> Due to its thick blubber, the NARW is able to call the Cold Pool home while feeding on its
> primary food choice, copepods (Dreyfust, 2022; NOAA, 2023). Climate vulnerability assessments and models have identified that species benefiting from the Cold Pool are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes (Miles et al., 2021). NARW are particularly vulnerable to environment changes and changes to their feeding patterns and accessibility, with temperature increases being linked to lower reproductive rates in the population (Greene, 2004). The population of NARW sits at 356 currently. After being whaled to the brink of extinction by the 1890s, its population never completely recovered (NOAA, 2023).
> B. Artificial Reefs
> It is understood that offshore wind projects offer a unique opportunity for parts of the
> human system (e.g., physical structure of a wind turbine) to engineer a natural system. This benefit is often referred to as the artificial reef dynamic (Degraer, et al., 2020). While biodiversity generally will increase around offshore wind infrastructure (Li, et al., 2023), this model is specifically interested in the impact that the artificial reef dynamic will have on NARW. Zooplankton are the foundation of a NARW diet, and changes in zooplankton biomass have been linked to changes in NARW growth rates (Meyer-Gutbrod et al., 2022).
> II. The Human System
> A. Stakeholder Support
> Offshore wind programs have a history of being a controversial topic for those living and working in coastal communities due to the unknowns of its impacts and large-range of public opinions. Those living in the area could find the wind turbines an eyesore for the view they often pay a premium for, or the fear the wind turbines could impact the industries relying on the area around the turbines, such as the commercial fishing or recreation industries (Freeman, 2023). However, It is also possible that there are no significant impacts, or even positive impacts, to coastal-related communities or industries through job creation and cost reductions (Bates and
>  2
> 
>  Firestone, 2015). We scratch the surface of measuring stakeholder impacts using both coastal resident stakeholder support losses due to NARW deaths and commercial fishermen perceptions of the impacts to their industry (Firestone et al., 2009; Brink and Dalton, 2018).
> B. Vessel collisions
> Vessel strikes pose one of the greatest threats to NARW populations (NOAA, 2020). One way
> in which offshore wind development has the potential to increase NARW death rates is through the addition of vessels used in wind turbine development, including surveys, construction, maintenance, and decommissioning. Ocean Wind is required to follow certain regulations that minimize the chances of vessel collisions, such as reducing vessel speeds when a whale is detected and during biologically important breeding months (NOAA, 2023). However, these rules are not always followed and there’s no time of year where whales are not seen in the area (NOAA, 2023). With ongoing challenges in climate change affecting whale migration patterns and unknown impacts due to offshore wind development rerouting major shipping and fishing lanes, it’s important to look additionally at how these two coupled systems interact (Freeman 2023).
> C. Noise Pollution
> The noise generated by offshore wind farms varies over the project life cycle, especially
> construction, as well as project operation (which produces less noise than construction but over a longer time span) (Madsen et al., 2006). Pile driving, a construction activity that involves hammering steel monopiles into the sea floor, is considered the greatest source of noise pollution (Madsen et al., 2006). Several measures are being taken to reduce the impact of noise pollution from turbine construction on marine mammals, including a moratorium on pile driving during the months of the highest presence of North Atlantic Right Whales in the lease area, as well as the use of sound attenuation devices during pile driving and detonation activities (NMFS, 2023).
> Model
> I. Model Inputs
> There are three key human and natural systems influencing our model, and one feedback loop (Figure 1):
> (1) Offshore wind infrastructure leads to an increase in noise pollution in the marine environment, which could lead to a decrease in NARW populations from auditory stress.
> (2) Offshore wind infrastructure leads to an increase in vessels for construction and maintenance, which could lead to a decrease in NARW populations from vessel strikes.
> (3) Offshore wind infrastructure provides an artificial reef, which leads to an increase of zooplankton (NARW prey), which could lead to an increase in NARW populations.
> (4) Feedback loop: Increased offshore wind infrastructure may lead to a change in the NARW population, and a change in the whale population leads to a change in stakeholder support, thus leading to a change in offshore wind infrastructure development.

> Our model results (Figure 1), have several important findings. First, to directly answer our research question, NARW populations do not decline and instead populations increase, reaching a total of 579 NARW by the end of the 30 year study period. However, the full 98 turbines that Ocean Wind planned to build were not able to be installed because as the turbines were being constructed, a total of 1.6 whales died and stakeholders support significantly dropped (eventually reaching 0.0054, or 0.54%, by the end of the study period). Therefore, construction of Ocean Wind completely halted after 36 turbines were built.

> III. Sensitivity analysis
> Sensitivity analysis 1: Impacts to Whales
> (A) Worst case scenario for impacts to wales
> We ran a sensitivity analysis that tests what the worst case scenario for whales could be in
> terms of impacts from offshore wind. In other words, what if mortality due to ship strikes and noise pollution is our maximum estimate instead of our central estimate, and what if the benefits of artificial reefs from offshore wind to whales are at their minimum values rather than their central estimates? Running our model in this situation we found that, compared to the base model results, whale populations reach a slightly lower level (536 individuals by the end of the simulation period, instead of 579), more whales die due to offshore wind (2.9 instead of 1.6), stakeholders support reaches an even lower level (0.000011 instead of 0.0054), and fewer turbines are built (29 instead of 36). We can see that even under the worst case scenario our results stand strong: NARW populations will not crash due to the development of Ocean Wind. We also find that less turbines will be built overall, although not by a drastic amount. And finally, stakeholder support reaches a level of well below 1%, which would be a very negative outcome for future community support of offshore wind development.
> (B) Best case scenario for impacts to whales
> Here we ran a sensitivity analysis that tests what the best case scenario for whales could be
> from Ocean Wind impacts. In other words, what if mortality due to ship strikes and noise pollution is our minimum estimate instead of our central estimate, and what if the benefits of artificial reefs are at their maximum values rather than their central estimates? Running the the model in this situation we find that, compared to the base model results, whale populations reach a higher level (633 individuals by the end of the simulation period, instead of 579), no whales die due to offshore wind (instead of 1.6), and therefore stakeholders support stays at 100% of its current level (instead of 0.54%), and therefore the full 98 turbines get built (36). This result is expected, given that it is plausible that offshore wind does not kill a signal NARW, and therefore the minimum amount of harm that offshore wind can cause whales is 0. Therefore, all turbines are built and stakeholders are happy. Because stakeholders support is so drastically affected by NARW deaths, a 0 whales dead scenario would be the best path for Ocean Wind building all 98 turbines.

>  Sensitivity analysis 2: Stakeholder Support
> (A) Stakeholders care about whales more than we suspected: Maximum support loss per NARW deaths & for fishers
> Motivation for this study partially comes from the controversy in how people view offshore
> wind projects throughout the US and abroad. Stakeholder support loss is first maximized, meaning that stakeholders care more about whales and the fishing industry than we suspected and therefore their support is lower than in our baseline model. Here, the North Atlantic Right Whale population increases from our baseline model from 579 individuals to 583 individuals. Our model also shows that the amount of turbines decreases from 36 to 31 turbines at the end of our study period, and the stakeholder support is substantially lower than our baseline model, at 0.000088%. This model shows that maximizing stakeholder support loss makes some slight impacts to both NARW populations and the number of turbines, but other factors might be more influential to our results.
> (B) Stakeholders care about whales less than we expected: Minimum stakeholder support loss per NARW death & for fishers
> We next minimize our stakeholder support variables, where people care less about the
> deaths of NARW due to offshore wind production, and fishers also care less about the offshore wind programs impacting their industry. We find that the NARW population is relatively robust to differences in stakeholder support, as both minimizing and maximizing stakeholder support shows the population at around 583 individuals. In this model, though, offshore wind infrastructure jumps up to 57 turbines. Stakeholder support is at about 4.88% at the end of our study time period, which is higher than our baseline scenario at 0.0054%, finding that minimizing stakeholder support loss shows that stakeholders are likely to support the production of more turbines when not considering the impacts to whales or the fishing industry.
> Sensitivity analysis 3: Entire east coast
> (A) What if we scale this model to represent offshore wind goals for the entire east coast? This model has many different uncertain interactions. While the desired turbines for this
> project may be 98, there are 1,500 total wind turbines that have been either proposed, approved, or are in development throughout the east coast Atlantic Ocean of the USA (McCrone, 2021). As mentioned in a previous model variable, the project location of Ocean Wind 1 covers a small portion of the entirety of the NARW habitat corridor. These whales can span from New England to Cape Canaveral, Florida (NOAA, 2023).
> For the model to reflect the goals of the energy transition, part of our sensitivity analysis included setting the desired turbines at 1,500. This led to a rapid development, but also continued to struggle with stakeholder support, and ultimately did not meet the 1,500 turbine goal, instead totaling 348 turbines by the end of the 30 year period. It is important to note that the amount of NARW by the end of the 30 year period was 378. The population did not decrease to the worst-case-scenario levels, however, their population was lower than best-case scenarios as well as scenarios in which stakeholders care more about whales than we anticipated.

>  Discussion
> The key takeaway from our model and sensitivity analyses is that the North Atlantic Right
> Whale population will not be significantly affected by the impacts of offshore wind turbine production, however we do find that there are less turbines built than what the Ocean Wind I project expects. These results call into question how to balance wind project objectives with the amount of turbines that local residents and industries are okay with. While our results show some interesting and unique perspectives from the natural-human coupled interactions between stakeholders, whales, and offshore wind production, there are some limitations to our model that should be considered when interpreting our results.
> Offshore wind production in the US is incredibly novel with many unknowns still to be discovered. Therefore, a lot of our data and variable calibrations come from international projects and the most-established program in the US (Block Island Wind Farm). These projects have different energy objectives, public opinions, NARW population densities, fish populations that could be impacted, and we try to aggregate these measures into our analysis for just an estimation on how the Ocean Wind I project could be similarly impacted. Our central values for our model come from these projects and various research papers, but we used our intuition to determine the ranges on each variable so we could estimate the impacts. Finally, a limitation to our project is in the scope of the model. There is no doubt that an extensive amount of variables should be used on both the human and natural side of a model to analyze the comprehensive impacts to an offshore wind project. Our model tries to establish a broad measure of how the human to natural system could function, but future research projects could further scratch the surface of modeling offshore wind and natural systems throughout the United States to start accounting for the many uncertainties of production.
> Conclusion
> The uncertainties relating to offshore wind projects significantly impact social perception
> and thus community support for offshore wind. While there are limitations to this model, it provides an important starting point for policymakers and communities to be able to ask important questions about their concerns as this rapid energy transition unfolds. An important takeaway from this model is an understanding regarding the lack of negative impact to NARW populations within the context of offshore wind development moving forward. Specifically, our model shows consistently that NARW populations do not collapse due to offshore wind development and specifically Ocean Wind 1 moving forward. This model also offers a unique perspective in which stakeholders have significant power - where stakeholder support loss from NARW or fishing impacts have real consequences to the number of turbines in the water.
> Overall, under uncertainty, this model can provide some relief to those concerned about whale populations being affected by offshore wind, as the results indicate that if populations do decrease, it is likely that it can be explained by other environmental circumstances, such as aforementioned fishing gear entanglements or vessel strikes unrelated to offshore wind development. Most importantly, this model shows that stakeholders who care about both NARW and the climate crisis can know that compromises to NARW specifically need not be made to meet offshore wind development related climate mitigation goals.

> Calculating NARW mortality rates due to noise pollution
> The 2023 National Marine Fisheries Service incidental take report for Ocean Wind 1
> estimates that 0.1-0.9 North Atlantic Right Whales (NARWs) will be exposed to level A harassment (injury to a mammal or mammal stock, as defined by the Marine Mammal Protection Act2) as a result of noise pollution. The incidental take report uses an estimated NARW population of 338 individuals. Therefore, noise pollution activities due to offshore wind construction could impact 0.029% - 0.27% of the population. However, the incidental take report includes a note stating that due to mitigation measures that Ocean Wind is required to undertake, NMFS does not predict nor authorize any level A take of a NARW. Therefore, for the purposes of our study, we estimate that Ocean Wind 1 could lead to NARW population reduction of 0% to 0.27%. Because this analysis was based on the entire set of 98 turbines, this equates to 0 to 0.000028 deaths per turbine. To be conservative and to account for uncertainty, we have set 0.000028 as our central value, and our maximum estimate is set as double this amount.

>  Calculating NARW mortality rates due to vessel collisions
> Crum et al., (2019) model the mortality rate of NARW in the southeast US due to vessel
> collisions each year from 2011-2016 using AIS vessel data and NARW abundance estimates, among other parameters. The use of AIS data captures the activity of vessels over 65 feet in length, which is consistent with the sizing of offshore wind vessels. Using their estimate of 0.034 whale mortality from 2010-2011, and their estimated total distance (km) traveled in the research area from 2010-2011, the estimated whale mortality rate per km traveled is 2.5e-7.
> The Ocean Wind Environmental Impact Statement estimates that construction of turbines would add between 20 and 65 vessels operating in the wind farm area and export cable route at any given time. They estimate that the project would generate a maximum of 3,392 total vessel trips annually for service operations, construction, crew transfer, and supply vessel trips. These numbers apply for both construction and operation phases of the wind project, and therefore are expected to last for the whole life cycle. Ocean Wind is approximately 24 km from shore, so we estimate an annual travel distance of 162,816km. This would result in a mortality rate due to ship strike of 0.041. However, this rate is an overestimate because the study by Crum et al., (2019) examined all whale vessel strikes, not just NARW. In order to determine what fraction of this rate could be attributed to just NARW, we used data from NOAA’s North Atlantic Right Whale Vessel Speed Rule Assessment (2020) to calculate that NARW ship strike rates are 13% of all ship strikes across their entire geographic range. We applied this rate to our calculation of NARW fatal ship strikes in the study region, acknowledging that there is an assumption here that the density of NARW compared to other whale populations in the study region mimic those in the entire geographical range of the NARW, and that this 13% value does not change over time despite fluctuating NARW population counts in our model.

Using this data, and making an assumption that a similar data set could apply to the Ocean Wind 1 project and that those concerned with marine life broadly are equally concerned with NARWs specifically, we developed the following formula:
> 0.57*0.75 + 0.2*0.5 + 0.14*0.25 + 0.9*0 = 0.5625
> This can be interpreted as a 56% decrease in support for offshore wind if NARW are harmed. To estimate the range, we used intuition to estimate that this could realistically vary by +/-0.35, given how heavily factors such as media and social norms can affect the way stakeholders react to whale deaths
> We further analyze the stakeholder support of commercial fishermen through a study by Brink and Dalton (2018), who interview fishermen on various topics related to offshore wind projects and organize the topics into creating indicators for how many fishermen noted a topic in each of their interviews. Because commercial fishermen are one of the most likely populations to have strong opinions and concerns for offshore wind implementation, we take the average measure of commercial fishermen that note positive impacts of offshore wind subtracted by the negative to find our measure for stakeholder support loss due to the fishing industry. Stakeholder support, through how the local community and commercial fisherman view offshore wind projects, gives an insight to how social pressures can impact project progression and the potential for future wind projects within the United States. Therefore, our stakeholder support measure is the geometric mean of these two. Stakeholder support starts at 100%, then decreases due to the square root of the stakeholder support loss due to NARW deaths and stakeholder support loss due to fishing industry impacts multiplied together. This value implies how many turbines are desired by the public, and impacts the optimal amount of wind turbines constructed.
> Calculating NARW benefits as a result of artificial reef dynamic
> In other regions of the world, there has been a 12% increase of zooplankton biomass around
> the vicinity of an offshore wind project (Daewel et al., 2022). Using the logic from other predator and prey dynamics, this model makes an assumption regarding an increase in zooplankton biomass impacting NARW population by increasing their growth rate. However, Ocean Wind 1 covers such a small amount of the full NARW corridor and thus is translated to a low portion of zooplankton biomass increase. We utilized the data highlighting a 12% increase in zooplankton biomass to understand the portion of the NARW corridor that Ocean Wind 1 will inhabit and thus the amount of zooplankton biomass that the NARW will consider a prey option. The average estimated range of NARW habitat is 1,260,000 square km, while the Ocean Wind 1 project occupies 276.97 square km. Therefore, Ocean Wind 1 makes up 0.022% or 0.00022 of the total NARW range. Using this percentage, and assuming that the amount of NARW biomass per unit of prey is 10%, we calculate a 0.0026 increase in zooplankton throughout the entire NARW range (Agrawal et al., 2013).

> Title: "Offshore Wind and North Atlantic Right Whales: Modeling an Uncertain Interaction"
> 
> Abstract:
> Amidst the ambitious US goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, concerns about the environmental impact on marine life, particularly the North Atlantic right whale (NARW), a vulnerable species under the Endangered Species Act, have become prevalent. This study focuses on the proposed Ocean Wind 1 project off the coast of New Jersey and its potential impacts on NARW populations, balancing the deployment of 98 planned turbines with stakeholder support dynamics. Utilizing an integrated model that considers factors such as noise pollution, vessel collisions, artificial reef benefits, and stakeholder support, the research explores the influence of offshore wind infrastructure on NARW populations and the extent of the project's realization.
> 
> The model outcomes indicate that while NARW populations may not face significant decline due to the wind project, stakeholder support is sensitive to whale mortalities associated with turbine construction. Simulations predict that despite the initial aim, only 36 out of 98 turbines would be constructed due to stakeholder opposition following 1.6 NARW deaths. Sensitivity analyses further reveal the robustness of NARW populations under various scenarios but consistently suggest fewer turbines than anticipated will be erected, highlighting stakeholder perception as a crucial factor in determining the project's scale. Consequently, the model provides policy insights and underscores the need for careful consideration of both marine conservation and stakeholder concerns in executing offshore wind projects.
