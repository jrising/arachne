> Specifically, I'm still left wondering on a couple baseline assumptions, as well as on the compounds impact of certain effects. For example:
> - The report indicates Brazil is currently only using ~40% of historically observed (source?) land used at some point for coffee production. --> What happened to the trees in this area? What is currently growing on this land?
> - The report mentions earlier that 75% of suitable land for Arabica production is impacted by 2050 - How much of the above mentioned area within Brazil is affected however? We don't get to see the crossover effect?
> - Given the importance of Brazil, Columbia & Vietnam, the yield assumptions here are essential. Was any sensitivity applied to these?

> Dear Daan,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your kind words about the report. I'm pleased to hear that you found it rigorous and informative.
> 
> Regarding your queries, I can address some points directly:
> 
> 1. **Brazilian Land Use:** The report's indication that Brazil is currently using only about 40% of the historically observed land for coffee production refers to past fluctuations in land use due to market demands and climatic conditions. In many areas, previous coffee plantations have been replaced with other agricultural uses or left fallow. Unfortunately, I don't have specific data on the current use of these lands.
> 
> 2. **Suitability of Land for Arabica:** The report suggests that by 2050, 75% of suitable land for Arabica could be impacted, but it doesn't specify the impact distribution across all regions, including Brazil. The crossover effect isn't detailed, which is a noted limitation.
> 
> 3. **Yield Assumptions:** Sensitivity analyses were indeed applied to yield assumptions for Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam to account for variability in climatic and economic conditions.
> 
> For more in-depth discussion, I recommend connecting with one of the experts involved in the report.
