> I am building a tool that tries to find a PDF for a given academic paper DOI. My normal process for that is to find the paper on Google Scholar and then click the "all N versions" link which pulls up a page that usually has a few different PDF options in the right-hand column. How could I implement this logic in python?
**assistant**:
> Creating a tool that interacts with Google Scholar can be quite useful, but it also presents certain challenges, particularly around automated access to Google Scholar's content. Google Scholar's terms of service generally do not allow crawling or scraping by automated systems, so you should proceed carefully and consider their policies.
> 
> With that caveat in mind, here is a conceptual layout of how you might approach this problem using Python. Keep in mind this is for educational purposes:
> 
> 1. **Use the `scholarly` package**:
>    The `scholarly` package in Python can interface with Google Scholar programmatically. However, it does not consistently support the "all versions" feature you mentioned. See if this package meets your current needs when filtered by DOIs.
> 
> 2. **Scraping fell through?** If `scholarly` or other ethically sound tools do not meet your needs, the below approach **is discouraged for live or full-scale use** due to compliance risks with Google Scholar's terms:
> 
>    ```python
>    import requests
>    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
>    
>    def get_scholar_versions(doi):
>        search_url = f"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q={doi}"
>        headers = {
>            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'
>        } 
> 
>        # Request search page
>        response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers)
>        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
> 
>        # Find the "all N versions" link
>        link = soup.find('a', text=lambda x: x and 'all versions' in x.lower())
>        if not link:
>            return []
> 
>        # Compose the absolute URL for all versions
>        all_versions_url = "https://scholar.google.com" + link.get('href')
>        
>        # Request the all versions page
>        response = requests.get(all_versions_url, headers=headers)
>        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
> 
>        # Extract PDFs from the results
>        pdf_links = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True) if 'pdf' in a['href'].lower()]
>        return pdf_links
> 
>    # Example Usage
>    print(get_scholar_versions('10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2'))
>    ```
> 
>    This script uses `requests` to fetch pages and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract links. However, note that Google might block requests or display CAPTCHA challenges if it detects scraping attempts.
> 
> 3. **Ethics and ALternatives**: 
>    - **API alternatives**: Use APIs provided by publishers, such as CrossRef or Unpaywall, which offer legal ways to find open-access versions via DOIs.
>    - **User Input or Confirmations**: Consider semi-automating the process by requiring user input at key points, e.g., letting them manually open pages and click, while the tool assists with logging and PDF handling.
> 
> Always prioritize terms of service, ethical constraints, and respect for web services when developing automated tools.
