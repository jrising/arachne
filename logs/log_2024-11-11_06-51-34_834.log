> Continued policy and business practices separate us by race and income into unequally resourced communities, creating a cycle where some benefit greatly and others, mostly people of color, are greatly harmed. Those bearing the brunt of these systems also bear the increasing burden of climate disasters.

> Importantly, available federal funding associated with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) presents potentially powerful, but time-sensitive, opportunities to advance building infrastructure improvements that reduce emissions and energy cost while improving occupant health and safety. However, these opportunities can be difficult to navigate without proper technical assistance.

> We know well that buildings can negatively impact the health and well-being of occupants through poor ventilation, outdated and unsafe energy systems, and lack of sufficient heating and cooling control. For instance, low-performing buildings can degrade air quality, thereby increasing the risk for asthma and other respiratory diseases. In tandem, high energy bills may force people to choose between heating or cooling their homes and paying for the other necessities such as healthcare and food. In fact, the Energy Information Administration predicted that household energy costs this winter would rise more for homes heated by fossil fuels than for those that are electrified. This increase will disproportionately affect low-income households and renters who are more likely to rely on fossil fuel heating and experience higher energy burdens.

> IMT seeks to address the challenge of inefficient and inequitable building design and management. In the United States, buildings account for more than 70% of electricity usage and 29% of gas consumption, contributing to roughly 35% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Low-performing buildings also contribute to issues such as poor air quality and increased respiratory illnesses, high energy bills and high energy burden (the percentage of a household’s income spent on energy costs) All of this leads to decreased levels of resilience against climate impacts such as heat waves and super storms, which can result in uncomfortable and unsafe buildings and potential displacement. Due to unjust policy and practices that separate us by race and income into unequally resourced communities, primarily Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and low-income communities, are harmed by the consequences of inefficient building design.

We do this by co-designing policies, programs, and business practice training that scale better buildings in the United States. Partnering with government, business, and community organizations, we put our buildings to work to reduce pollution, protect health, create wealth and economic opportunity, and enable resilient communities.

> Certain policies and business practices inadvertently segregate communities along racial and income lines, leading to an unfortunate imbalance where not all resources are equitably distributed. These disparate conditions disproportionately affect people of color and can impede their capacity to weather climate impacts effectively.

> Recognizing the existence of these systemic issues, the recent allocation of funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) brings forth real opportunities. These financial resources could importantly contribute to advancing infrastructure improvements, thereby reducing emissions and energy costs. Moreover, such advances would concurrently enhance the health, safety, and comfort of building occupants. While potentially complex to navigate, proper technical assistance can ensure these opportunities are fully leveraged.

> Buildings, if not optimally managed and designed, can adversely affect occupants' health by compromising air quality and necessitating disproportionate spending on energy bills. In essence, individuals and families may find themselves choosing between fundamental needs like healthcare, food, and adequate building temperature, especially in the colder months. It is a concern that the Energy Information Administration anticipates a sharp increase in energy costs this winter, particularly for homes reliant on fossil fuels. Such a reality poses a disproportionate threat to lower-income households and renters who typically bear higher energy burdens.
> 
> The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) is passionately committed to addressing these challenges. In the United States, buildings are responsible for a significant portion of electricity and gas consumption leading to approximately 35% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Less efficient buildings not only exacerbate these environmental concerns but also contribute to health issues and higher energy expenditures. This invariably affects the communities' ability to withstand climate disasters such as heatwaves and extreme storms, leading to potential displacement.

> We believe in building a bridge connecting the priorities of communities on the frontline, governments, and the building industry–empowering shared responsibility and collaboration in creating sustainable solutions. These solutions revolve around high-performing buildings acting as the cornerstone of an equitable, climate-resilient future.
> 
> IMT's vision revolves around the construct that by improving buildings, lives are optimized. Improved buildings signify reduced pollution, bolstered health, wealth and economic opportunity, and resilient communities. Our task involves transforming current market realities into building blocks for a future where inclusivity and low carbon footprints are the norm. Everyone thrives in this envisioned future.

> The Building Innovation Hub (Hub), a project initiated by IMT, exists to guide building industry professionals in and surrounding Washington DC. Recognizing the importance of deploying sustainable and equitable practices, the Hub aims to foster a culture of innovation that takes the industry beyond current needs and towards the requirements of the future–a future of high-performing buildings.

> At the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), we are steadfast in our mission of encouraging a demand for high performance buildings. These are buildings that optimize elements of energy, environmental, and economic performance for building owners, occupants, and the broader community. Our approach involves co-designing policies, programs, and training aimed at scaling better building practices across the United States. We partner with various stakeholders including government outfits, businesses, and community organizations to reduce pollution, protect health, increase wealth and economic opportunity, and build resilient communities.
