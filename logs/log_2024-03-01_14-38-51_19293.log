**user**:
> Are any marine turtles, reptiles, mammals or other groups that aren't fish but have a backbone commercially harvested?
**assistant**:
> There are indeed several non-fish marine species with backbones that are commercially harvested, often subject to varying levels of regulation and conservation efforts. However, it's important to note that "commercially harvested" sometimes refers to legal, regulated industries, while at other times it can involve illegal hunting or poaching, which is a serious threat to many species. Here are several examples:
> 
> 1. **Marine Mammals**: Seals and sea lions were once widely harvested for their fur, meat, and oil. Today, commercial hunting is heavily regulated or banned in many regions, but some traditional hunting still takes place, such as the seal hunt in Newfoundland, Canada.
> 
> 2. **Reptiles**: Sea turtles have been hunted for their meat, shells, and eggs, but today, all seven species are protected under international law due to their endangered status. In certain parts of the world, some reptiles such as lizards and snakes are hunted for their skin.
> 
> 3. **Birds**: Various species of seabirds have been hunted for their meat, eggs, and feathers. In parts of Alaska, for instance, indigenous communities are allowed to harvest certain seabirds under customary and traditional use regulations.
> 
> 4. **Invertebrates**: A wide variety of marine invertebrates are commercially harvested, including lobsters, crabs, shrimps, oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, octopuses, and various sea snail species (like abalone and whelks). These industries are subject to varying levels of sustainable fishery certification.
> 
> 5. **Cetaceans**: Whales and dolphins have been hunted for their meat and oil, but international treaties have largely halted commercial whaling. Despite this, some countries, including Iceland, Norway, and Japan, continue to hunt whales.
> 
> As a general rule, it's best to prefer sustainably sourced seafood and to avoid purchasing products made from endangered species in order to support the conservation of ocean biodiversity.
