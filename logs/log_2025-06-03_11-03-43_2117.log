> How can I estimate a standard deviation from information on the mean and one or two quantile values?
**assistant**:
> Estimating a standard deviation from the mean and quantile values typically involves assuming a specific distribution, most often the normal distribution. Hereâ€™s a general approach to do this:
> 
> 1. **Assume a Distribution:** The normal distribution is a common assumption since it's symmetric and well-understood. 
> 
> 2. **Identify the Quantiles:** Let's say you know the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3). These are the boundaries of the interquartile range (IQR). Alternatively, if you have other quantiles, you can use them similarly.
> 
> 3. **Estimate Standard Deviation:**
>    - For a normal distribution, the distance from the mean to a specific percentile can be related to the standard deviation using the *z-score*.
>    - For the IQR (distance from the 25th to the 75th percentile), the relevant z-scores are approximately -0.675 for the 25th percentile and 0.675 for the 75th percentile.
>    - If you only have one quantile, say the 95th percentile (z-score of approximately 1.645), you can still proceed by using this quantile's deviation from the mean.
> 
> 4. **Use the Known Values:**
>    - For IQR: Calculate the difference between Q3 and Q1 (which gives you the IQR), then estimate the standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) using the relation \(IQR = \sigma \times (0.675 - (-0.675)) = 1.35\sigma\). Thus, \(\sigma = \frac{IQR}{1.35}\).
>    - For a single quantile: If you have a quantile value like the 95th percentile (Q95), calculate the standard deviation by the relation \(\sigma = \frac{|Q95 - \text{mean}|}{1.645}\).
> 
> 5. **Consider Other Distributions:** If your data is skewed or doesn't likely follow a normal distribution, consider distributions like the log-normal or exponential. However, the estimation becomes more complex and might require additional known parameters or fitting techniques.
> 
> Note that this method involves assumptions about the distribution, and deviations from this can affect the accuracy of your estimated standard deviation.
**user**:
> Can you turn this into a function in R?
**assistant**:
> Sure! Below is an R function that estimates the standard deviation based on the mean and the specified quantile values. The function will handle both the IQR (using Q1 and Q3) and a single quantile input (like Q95):
> 
> ```r
> estimate_sd <- function(mean, q1 = NULL, q3 = NULL, q95 = NULL) {
>   if (!is.null(q1) && !is.null(q3)) {
>     # Calculate IQR
>     iqr <- q3 - q1
>     sd_est <- iqr / 1.35  # IQR method
>   } else if (!is.null(q95)) {
>     # Calculate SD using the 95th percentile
>     sd_est <- abs(q95 - mean) / 1.645  # Single quantile method
>   } else {
>     stop("Please provide either Q1 and Q3 or Q95")
>   }
>   
>   return(sd_est)
> }
> 
> # Example usage:
> # mean_value <- 50
> # q1_value <- 45
> # q3_value <- 55
> # estimated_sd_iqr <- estimate_sd(mean_value, q1_value, q3_value)
> # estimated_sd_single <- estimate_sd(mean_value, q95 = 60)
> 
> print(estimated_sd_iqr)  # Estimated SD using Q1 and Q3
> print(estimated_sd_single)  # Estimated SD using Q95
> ```

> ### Explanation of the Function
> - **Inputs:**
>   - `mean`: The mean value of your dataset.
>   - `q1`: The first quartile (25th percentile, optional).
>   - `q3`: The third quartile (75th percentile, optional).
>   - `q95`: The 95th percentile (optional).
> - **Logic:**
>   - The function checks if both Q1 and Q3 are provided to calculate the IQR method.
>   - If Q95 is provided instead, it calculates the standard deviation based on that single quantile.
>   - If neither condition is satisfied, it returns an error message.
>   
> You can adjust the function further based on your needs or additional quantiles! Let me know if you have any more questions or tweaks you'd like!
**user**:
> Can you set it up that I give both the quantile value and the quantile percentage, for each quantile that I give (one or two such), rather than assuming I know that it's q95 etc?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's an updated R function that accepts both the quantile values and their corresponding percentages. You can provide one or two quantiles, along with their percentages, and the function will calculate the standard deviation accordingly.

> estimate_sd <- function(mean, quantiles) {
>   if (length(quantiles) < 1 || length(quantiles) > 2) {
>     stop("Please provide one or two quantile values with their percentages")
>   }
>   
>   if (length(quantiles) == 2) {
>     # Extract the values and percentages for Q1 and Q3 (or other quantiles)
>     q1_value <- quantiles[[1]]$value
>     q1_percent <- quantiles[[1]]$percent / 100
>     q2_value <- quantiles[[2]]$value
>     q2_percent <- quantiles[[2]]$percent / 100
>     
>     # Calculate IQR (assuming q1 is the lower quantile)
>     if (q1_percent < q2_percent) {
>       iqr <- q2_value - q1_value
>       sd_est <- iqr / 1.35  # IQR method
>     } else {
>       stop("The first quantile must be less than the second quantile")
>     }
>     
>   } else {
>     # Extract the single quantile value and percentage
>     q_value <- quantiles[[1]]$value
>     q_percent <- quantiles[[1]]$percent / 100
>     
>     # Calculate SD using single quantile
>     z_value <- qnorm(q_percent)  # Get the z-score for the given percentile
>     sd_est <- abs(q_value - mean) / z_value
>   }
>   
>   return(sd_est)

> - **Inputs:**
>   - `mean`: The mean value of your dataset.
>   - `quantiles`: A list of quantile objects, where each object contains:
>     - `value`: The quantile value (numeric).
>     - `percent`: The percentile corresponding to that quantile (numeric, not exceeding 100).
>   
> - **Logic:**
>   - The function checks that one or two quantiles are supplied.
>   - For two quantiles, it calculates the interquartile range (IQR) and uses it to estimate the standard deviation.
>   - For a single quantile, it calculates the z-score based on the provided percentage using the `qnorm()` function and then estimates the standard deviation.

> You can easily call this function with the desired quantile values and their percentages. Let me know if you need further modifications!
