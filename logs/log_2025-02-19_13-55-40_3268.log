> Hope everything is going well! This is Lingxiao, from Nature Climate Change. I am writing to ask whether you are interested in writing a Review paper regarding the social cost of carbon. We are interested in this topic because more and more researchers studying climate impacts, beyond economists, are using the concept as the cornerstone of analysis, yet my feeling is that in many cases they are not really applied properly. The potential Review could discuss the evolution of SCC estimates, what is the current stage, how are they should be applied in real world (especially for researchers/policy makers not fully understand the concept), and what are the future trends. We believe it is a very important topic, and this potential work could be a guideline for the climate community. Your rich experience in climate damages and the SCC, with both statistical and structural modeling approaches, could be highly valuable for our audience. I wonder would you be interested in writing a Review Article, about 3,000 - 5,000 words long, on this topic. If you are interested, you are also welcomed to invite your colleagues to write the piece with you.

We definitely understand if the plan is not working for you, and you are welcomed to suggest other scholars that you believe could write such paper. If you think it is necessary, we can have a short online meeting to discuss the potential next steps. Thank you very much and looking forward to your reply.

> Thank you for your interests! We do not have a specific publication timeline for this. You can definitely start with this from next month. I suggest that you can submit a synopsis by the end of February, with potential structure and author list. Then we can make our suggestions from the editorial side. After we agree on the synopsis, we can move to the full draft and peer review process. Hopefully we can have the whole process done in 8-9 months. However, we can definitely be flexible, since we prioritize the quality and relevance of this work.

**assistant**:
> Creating a synopsis for a review paper generally involves outlining the main points and providing a clear structure for the document. Here's a guide on what might be expected for the synopsis requested by Lingxiao:
> 
> 1. **Title**: Start with a tentative title that captures the essence of the review.
> 
> 2. **Objective**: Clearly state the main objective of your review. For this paper, it could be something like "Clarifying the use and application of the social cost of carbon (SCC) in climate impact analysis."
> 
> 3. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the topic and explain why the SCC is significant and why this review is necessary. Mention the common misuse or misunderstanding that you plan to address.
> 
> 4. **Structure/Outline**:
>    - **Evolution of SCC Estimates**: Describe how SCC estimates have developed over time, including key methodologies and updates.
>    - **Current Applications**: Discuss how SCC is currently being applied, especially by researchers and policymakers. Highlight any common misconceptions or errors in its application.
>    - **Guidance for Proper Use**: Provide guidelines or best practices for applying SCC appropriately. This could be divided between researcher-focused and policy-focused applications.
>    - **Future Trends and Developments**: Speculate on the future directions for SCC, such as new methodologies, integration with other metrics, or policy implications.
> 
> 5. **Potential Co-Authors**: List any colleagues or collaborators you plan to include in the project, along with their contributions if you already have any in mind.
> 
> 6. **Bibliography/Key References**: Provide a short list of key references that informed your understanding of the SCC and which you expect to cite in the full paper.
> 
> 7. **Estimated Length and Timeline**: Mention the expected length of the review and reiterate the proposed timeline for completing the synopsis and the full manuscript.
> 
> Keep the synopsis concise (about 1-2 pages) while providing enough detail to convey your approach and intentions. Flexibility is key, so invite feedback and suggestions from the editor, indicating your willingness to integrate their insights. If you need more input on specific sections, let's delve deeper into any part you'd like!
