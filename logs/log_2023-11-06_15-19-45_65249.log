**user**:
> How can I make a process queue in python? I want one thread to add items to the queue and another thread to work through them.
**assistant**:
> Sure, you can accomplish this using Python's built-in `queue` module combined with `threading`. Here's a simplified example:
> 
> ```python
> import threading
> import queue
> import time
> 
> def producer(q):
>     count = 0
>     while True:
>         data = f"Task-{count}"
>         q.put(data)
>         print(f"Added {data} to queue")
>         count += 1
>         time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second before producing the next task
> 
> def consumer(q):
>     while True:
>         data = q.get()
>         print(f"Processing {data}")
>         q.task_done()  # Signal that a formerly enqueued task is complete
>         time.sleep(2)  # Simulate processing time
> 
> # Create the queue
> q = queue.Queue()
> 
> # Create a producer thread and a consumer thread
> producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer, args=(q,))
> consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer, args=(q,))
> 
> # Start the threads
> producer_thread.start()
> consumer_thread.start()
> 
> # Join threads so the application will wait for both threads to complete
> producer_thread.join()
> consumer_thread.join()
> ```
> 
> In this example, one thread, the **producer**, adds items ('tasks') to the queue. The other thread, the **consumer**, retrieves tasks from the queue and processes them.
> 
> While this example runs the threads forever, you might want to add some checks or signals to end the loop after some specific event or after the queue is empty.
> 
> Remember, when sharing data between threads, you must be careful to avoid race conditions. Python's `queue.Queue` class is thread-safe, meaning it uses locks to ensure that an operation ('put' or 'get') by one thread is not interrupted by an operation by another thread.
> 
> If you need more control over the task completion, especially to know when all tasks in the queue are done, you can use the `queue.Queue.join()` method. Call `q.task_done()` for each task removed from the queue. This will unblock then `q.join()` call once all items have been processed. This helps in graceful shutdown of your worker threads.
