> Fundraising meetings can determine the success of your initiatives, so it's crucial to plan and execute them effectively. Here are my recommendations for best practices:
> 
> 1. **Prepare:** Define clear objectives and goals for each meeting. Organize and distribute relevant materials beforehand, including an agenda, financials, and progress reports. 
> 
> 2. **Engage stakeholders:** Make sure the right people attend the meeting - those with passion for the cause, decision-making capacity and influence to attract funding.
> 
> 3. **Structure your meeting**: Start with a positive opening, summarizing recent successes, then discuss the objectives of the meeting. Review financials and progress towards your goals. 
> 
> 4. **Articulate your needs clearly:** Communicate about your funding goals, the impact of potential donations and how they will be used.
> 
> 5. **Open dialogue and facilitate discussion:** After presenting necessary information and needs, facilitate a discussion to generate ideas and strategies for fundraising.
> 
> 6. **Encourage participation:** Allow everyone to express their thoughts and ideas. An inclusive atmosphere promotes creative solutions and commitment.
> 
> 7. **Assign tasks:** At the end of the meeting, assign actions for each member. This creates responsibility and ensures continued progress towards goals.
> 
> 8. **Follow up:** After meeting, share minutes of the meeting including decisions made and tasks assigned. This keeps everyone informed, responsible and accountable.
> 
> 9. **Practice gratitude:** Always remember to express appreciation to your team members for their time, ideas, and commitments.
> 
> Remember, every fundraising meeting is an opportunity to inspire, galvanize, and motivate your team towards reaching your financial goals. Hence, the atmosphere should be one of positivity, support and collective responsibility.
