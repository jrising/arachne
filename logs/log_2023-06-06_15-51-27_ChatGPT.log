**assistant**:
> In an office context, a piece of furniture with drawers that stands a couple feet high is often referred to as a "filing cabinet" or "file cabinet." These are typically used for storing and organizing documents. They come in various sizes, with some designed to fit under desks, and others are taller, standalone units.
**user**:
> A filing cabinet is usually with large drawers. I'm thinking of a furniture with small drawers.
**assistant**:
> In an office setting, a piece of furniture with small drawers could be called a "desk organizer" or "desktop organizer" if it's small enough to fit on a desk. If it's freestanding and a bit larger, it might be called a "storage cabinet" or "storage unit."
> 
> Alternatively, if the drawers are very small, such as those designed to hold specific items like stationery or craft supplies, it could be called a "drawer organizer" or "multi-drawer storage chest." 
> 
> In some cases, it might be referred to as a "pedestal" or "mobile pedestal," which are usually smaller cabinets on wheels that fit under a desk. They often have a mix of small and larger drawers, typically for personal storage and file storage respectively.
