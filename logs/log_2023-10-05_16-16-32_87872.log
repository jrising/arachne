**user**:
> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. One section is on recreational fishing, and it currently has the following information:
> 
> From 2011 to 2020, Delaware’s marine recreational fishing involved an average of 216,000 anglers annually, with a majority (125,000) coming from out-of-state. Shore fishing was the most popular, accounting for around 1.48 million trips, followed by private boating with approximately 788,000 trips. Atlantic croaker was the most commonly harvested species (average of 230 thousand fish), while summer flounder and bluefish were also popular targets. Tautog and black sea bass were notable for both their harvest and release numbers.

> Since writing this, we have wanted to incorporate the following edits:
> * We should start with a description of what recreational fishing actually refers to. Here is a description that was written separately: Recreational Fishing in Delaware refers to the hobby of catching different types of fish, like bluefish, cartilaginous fishes, catfishes, cods and hakes, dolphins, drums, eels, flounders, grunts, herrings, jacks, mullets, other fishes, porgies, puffers, sculpins, sea basses, searobins, temperate basses, toadfishes, triggerfishes/filefishes, tunas, mackerels, and wrasses., in Delaware's waters for non-commercial purposes. These waters are divided into three main areas: inland (rivers and lakes), nearshore (up to three miles from the coast), and offshore (beyond three miles). People generally do fishing from shore and fishing by charter boat, party boat and private / rental boat.
> * * Note: I’m not sure about the whole list of fish here (that they are all caught in Delaware). Maybe just mention the key species from the table below.
> * We have added a figure 28 which shows the three regions used for reporting recreational fishing catches. These are “inland”, “< 3 miles from shore” and “> 3 miles from shore”.
> * Figure 29 reports fish catches for each region, from the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP).
> * Figures 30 and 31 show recreational fishing activity from surveys. We introduce this with the text: “Recreational surveys can provide another perspective on the use of coastal and open waters for recreational fishing, although these show that recreational fishing by boat covers the planning area (see Figure 30).” However, this can be expanded. The two figures show data from the Delaware Recreational Uses survey which shows footprint of recreational fishing from boats (figure 30) and shore (figure 31).
> * You can also refer to “Table 2: Angler residence and fishing trip statistics.” (which shows how many anglers come from in-state and out-of-state and how many use boats vs. shore); and “Table 3: Recreational fishing harvest and catch-and-release in Delaware. The Key Species are the major species caught in Delaware.”

**assistant**:
> Certainly, here's how the expanded text might look incorporating the new information:
> 
> Recreational Fishing in Delaware refers to the practice of catching a variety of different fish species in Delaware's waters for non-commercial purposes, or essentially, for fun, sport, or self-sustenance. Commonly caught species include, but are not limited to, bluefish, Atlantic croaker, summer flounder, black sea bass, tautog, catfish, drums, and tunas. 
> 
> These fishing activities take place in three main distinct regions: Inland, which includes rivers and lakes; Nearshore, extending up to three miles from the coast; and Offshore, the area beyond three miles. Each of these locales presents unique opportunities and challenges, which in turn dictate the species variety that could be encountered by the angler.
> 
> From 2011 to 2020, on average, Delaware’s marine recreational fishing welcomed around 216,000 anglers annually, with a significant majority, 125,000, coming from out-of-state. As detailed in Table 2, the popularity of these events fluctuated over the years with both in-state and out-of-state participation reaching a minimum of 64,000 and 69,000 and maximums of 129,000 and 190,000, respectively.
> 
> The preferred method of fishing differed widely among the participants, with fishing from the shore emerging as the most popular, accounting for approximately 1.48 million trips annually. Private boating followed closely with nearly 788,000 trips. Anglers seeking a more luxurious experience opted for For-Hire services, marking about 22,000 outings. The total combined fishing efforts summed up to be around 2.29 million trips per annum.
> 
> Undoubtedly, the diversity and abundance of species played a huge role in Delaware's appeal to anglers. As shown in Table 3, the Atlantic croaker was the most harvested species with an average of 230,000 fish caught yearly. Summer flounder, bluefish, black sea bass, and tautog also topped the charts in popularity. Each of these species had notable figures for both harvest and release numbers.
> 
> Figures 28, 29, 30, and 31 present visual illustrations and additional data to reinforce the information presented above. Figure 28 delineates the three primary regions for recreational fishing within Delaware, while Figure 29 reports fish catches for each region, from the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP). Figures 30 and 31 depict recreational fishing activity in terms of geographical distribution, collected from the Delaware Recreational Uses survey which indicates the footprint of recreational fishing from boats (Figure 30), and from shore (Figure 31). 
> 
> Hence, recreational fishing in Delaware not only provides a popular pastime for its residents and tourists alike but also has implications in the vibrant ecosystem and local economy.
