> Reproducing a figure from a report in the supplementary information of your paper can be possible, but you need to consider a few important aspects:
> 
> 1. **Copyright Permission:** If the figure is protected by copyright, you should obtain permission from the copyright holder, which is often the publisher or the author of the report. This is especially important if the report is published by an academic or professional publisher.
> 
> 2. **Citation and Attribution:** Even if you reproduce the figure, proper citation and attribution to the original source are crucial. Make sure the figure legend or caption includes details about the original source.
> 
> 3. **Publisher Policies:** Check the policy of the journal you are submitting to. Some journals have specific guidelines about the use of previously published materials in the main text and supplementary information.
> 
> 4. **Use of Public Domain or Open Access Material:** If the report specifies that the content is in the public domain or open access under a Creative Commons license, you may have more freedom in use but must still follow the terms of the license regarding attribution and modification.
> 
> 5. **Modification:** If you plan to alter the figure, be careful with how you describe the changes and ensure that they don't misrepresent the original data.
> 
> 6. **Informational Role:** Since it's in the supplementary information, you might have more leeway than in the main manuscript, but the above points still apply.
