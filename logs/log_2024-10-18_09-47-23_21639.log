> Good Wed Morning,  Would you please reach out individually to your graduate student advisees to encourage them to attend the UD GIS Day Celebration event if they have interests in geospatial techniques.  The event is 1/2 day with lightning talks, posters, software demo, and breakfast and lunch.  Encourage them to present a 10 minute lightning talk or a poster (UD IT prints for free). The event is a perfect way to work on public speaking skills since the event is a smaller (and friendly) audience. The abbreviated event agenda is listed below.  
> 
> We ask that those attending register so we know the # of attendees for ordering the break and lunch goodies.  Also, if appropretice, please announce in your courses.  
> 
> Thanks for your help in spreading the word.  Tracy
