> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."
> 
> Second, here is a peer's statement for comparison:
> ---
> Since my appointment at UC Davis I have taught 5 different courses, of which 3 are completely new classes developed by myself (or in one case with a co-instructor) and one of which I substantially overhauled when I began teaching. My classes mostly focus on teaching environmental policy evaluation, including principles of economic analysis, to undergraduate and graduate students without economics backgrounds (ESP 168a, taught 5 times; ENV 200b, taught twice). Making this technical material accessible and relevant to all students is a pedagogical challenge. My teaching philosophy focuses on developing general quntitative skills and on demonstrating the application of the material through applied examples.
> My largest class is ESP 168a: Methods of Environmental Policy Evaluation (5 units), which I have taught 5 times with enrollment varying between 90 and 120 students. The course is required in our Environmental Policy Analysis and Planning major and minor and covers methods relevant to the analysis of environmental policy. I fully revised the curriculum for this class, producing new lectures, problem sets, and in-class case studies. The problem sets help students develop skills in modeling, data analysis, and data visualization. Case-studies apply material learned in class to real-world regulatory analysis problems (such as lifecycle greenhouse gas impacts of the Renewable Fuel Standard). Student evaluations have been consistently positive, with recent class and instructor ratings ranging between 4.3 and 4.8 out of 5 (including one quarter taught online via Zoom due to the COVID 19 pandemic).
> Jointly with Professor Robert Hijmans, I have developed a new undergraduate class - ESP 106: Introduction to Environmental Data Science (3 units), which will be a core class in a new Environmental Data Science track in the Environmental Science and Management major. The goal of this class is to equip students interested in environmental science and policy with a foundation in programming and data analysis they can build on in their studies and future careers. Comfort with quantitative data analysis is increasingly important in many environmental careers but modern data analysis tools have a high barrier to entry. The class teaches students with no prior background the fundamentals of programming in R, good coding practices, principles of data analysis and visualization, and introduces spatial data analysis. The class was taught for the first time in 2021 and received excellent class (4.2) and instructor scores (4.7), particularly given the challenges of teaching coding remotely.
> My graduate teaching is in the Environmental Policy and Management (EPM) masters program. I developed a new core class for that program, ENV 203: Environmental Policy Clinic, which I taught twice. This class is a capstone experience for the EPM students, based on the law school clinic model, and involves a six month group project working with an external partner. The standard of projects has been high, with both students and client organizations expressing satisfaction with the model. I have twice taught the core environmental economics class in that program (ENV 200b: Environmental Policy Evaluation) which covers principles of economic analysis, market failures, and policy instrument design for professional masters students. I also provide guest lectures to graduate courses in Ecology and Agriculture and Resource Economics.
> I am affiliated with five graduate groups  (Agriculture and Resource Economics, Energy Systems, Geography, Ecology, and EPM) and as a result work with graduate students from a range of disciplines. I have worked closely with three PhD students. Two were in the Agriculture and Resource Economics graduate group and graduated in 2020. Of these I was co-chair of the dissertation committee for one (Matthew Gammans) and a committee member for another (Jesus Gonzalez). I am sole advisor for Bernie Bastien who is completing his 4th year in the Geography Graduate Group and is on track to graduate next year. Both Jesus and Bernie have published papers overseen and guided by myself that have appeared in highly respected journals (Nature Sustainability, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, and Environmental Research Letters). I have also advised undergraduate research. Arianna Stokes completed her undergraduate thesis under my supervision and is currently second author on a paper in revision for the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economics (8). I have advised 9 professional masters students in the EPM program, of whom 5 have graduated.
> I have participated in 8 qualifying exams for four graduate groups within UC Davis (Agriculture and Resource Economics, Geography, Transportation Technology and Policy, and Energy), and was an external member for a qualifying exam at Dartmouth University.

> Despite teaching obligations being moderated over the past few years, I have remained active and engaged as an educator. From 2018, I taught three distinctive courses and two seminars. My position at LSE was fully research oriented, but Iassisted in delivering the large ``Climate Change: Science, Economics, and Policy'' course annually and assumed full responsibility for one year during the incumbent professorâ€™s sabbatical. My position at UD has a requirement of one course per semester, and my teaching has also been interrupted by a parental leave and semester sabbatical. Descriptions of these courses are provided in Evidential Material \ref{sec:courses} and a summary is below.

> My course in Complex Systems Analysis (MAST467/667) exemplifies my teaching philosophy, and explicitly combines applications, theory, and techniques, aiming to provide both the methods necessary to do research in complexity and a deeper understanding of how those methods
> and their insights work together. The class was project-oriented, with a series of labs and a student-developed final project. Applications in lecture and labs highlighted the many connections between aspects of complexity and non-linearity, and they inspired student-directed final projects using techniques across the course.
> 
> Half of the students were outside of SMSP, and three from outside of CEOE.
> The student reviews were very positive: all instructor responses were 5's and course scores were 5 on all questions except for a 4.67 on outside readings. One student listed some of my strengths as an instructor:
> \say{Patience; Accuracy of content; Good pacing; Quality materials ; Content rich in figures; Availability to assist students; Knowledge of the topics; Enthusiasm for the topics; Hybrid class; Practical labs .....to only name a few...}
> 
> Another student highlighted my interdisciplinary strengths:
> \say{In my view, incredibly well-informed about a really wide variety of material, at all different levels. Dr. Rising seems to be super comfortable whether asked
> about the specific details about some algorithm or concept, or for example asked about the dimensions of social, economic, or environmental impact that
> its use may produce in some scenario. This strength fits the course (and especially the scope of the course) perfectly.}
> 
> I have also taught a course in Climate Change Economics (MAST 488/688). This course helped students understand how natural and social science come together to understand climate risks, mitigation challenges, and international cooperation. One student highlighted this, saying that the course
> \say{really mixed the science with economics well, its important to see how the two go hand in hand and James did a great job demonstrating how to do it and why its important}
> 
> The undergraduate students found the course more challenging, and I have since revised the course grant to provide more structure and hands-on learning for these students.
> 
> The Marine Policy Seminar is a rotating 1-credit course intended for Ph.D. students to present their work and get feedback. After teaching this course, I developed an alternative Philosophy of Research seminar aimed at improving students' research capacity through a deeper philosophical understanding of the research process. Student views of the course were polarized, but multiple students identified my \say{clear passion [for the] subject [which] encouraged student participation} and the class discussions which covered a wide range of topics as strengths of the course.

> I have also been an active mentor at LSE and UD for several Masters students (including two co-authors, now PhD students). I have advised a diverse group of four Ph.D. students (each from a different country), as well as nine Masters students and managed additional Ph.D., Masters, and undergraduate students within projects. I have also sat on Orals and Thesis committees for four students.

> \subsection*{Course Overview}
> 
> Although my teaching obligations have fluctuated in recent years, I've maintained an enthusiastic presence in the classroom. Since 2018, I have designed and delivered three unique courses and two seminars. My stint at LSE was primarily research-focused, yet I annually contributed to the delivery of the comprehensive course "Climate Change: Science, Economics, and Policy." Furthermore, I assumed complete responsibility for the course during the primary professor's sabbatical. My current role at UD requires me to deliver one course per semester. However, these responsibilities have been periodically interspersed with parental leave and a sabbatical semester. A detailed description of each course I've taught can be viewed in Evidential Material \ref{sec:courses}.

> The course "Complex Systems Analysis" (MAST467/667) embodies my educational philosophy, which centers around an intricate interplay of theory, technique, and application. Designed to equip students with necessary research competencies, the course introduces students to the unifying principles and the divergent methodologies of complexity. Students completed a sequence of labs and a final project, which was of their own design.
> 
> Student feedback highlighted my interdisciplinary strength: \say{...Dr. Rising can deftly converse about-minute algorithmic details or explore the social, environmental, or economic impacts of its application...This perspective is perfect for the scope of this course.}
> 
> In the course "Climate Change Economics" (MAST 488/688), I demonstrate how natural and social sciences synthesize to understand climate risks, mitigation challenges, and international cooperation. Moreover, I revised the course design to ensure a more structured and hands-on learning experience for our undergraduate students.
> 
> The "Philosophy of Research" seminar is my recent initiative for bolstering students' research skills. There some polarized views about the course, but several students appreciated the broad range of topics and my fervor for the subject.
