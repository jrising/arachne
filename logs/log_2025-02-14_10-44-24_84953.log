> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope this email finds you well.
> 
> I recently applied for the PhD program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware and wanted to reach out to express my strong interest in your research. Your work on hydro economic optimization models and their integration with IAMs resonates deeply with my research background in water scarcity and desalination efficiency assessments.
> 
> My master's research ( energy economics) focused on evaluating desalination methods in addressing freshwater scarcity, where I employed Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the efficiency of different desalination technologies. Given the critical role of infrastructure investments in water systems—an aspect highlighted in your work—I see strong conceptual connections between your approach to water-energy-food (WEF) trade-offs and my focus on optimizing water supply through desalination. The integration of economic valuation and decision-making under uncertainty in IAMs, as you discuss, could provide a valuable framework for analyzing long-term investments in desalination as part of sustainable water management strategies.
> 
> I would be delighted to further explore how my research interests align with your work and how I could contribute to ongoing projects in this domain. I would greatly appreciate any insights you might have regarding my application and the opportunity to collaborate.
> 
> Looking forward to your response.

> Best regards,

**user**:
> Can you edit this to note that the email is too late for funding in the current round, and they would need to wait until next year (applying around October) to be considered.
