**assistant**:
> The DIVA (Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment) coastal dataset is widely used for modeling the impacts of sea level rise and other coastal risks. However, when it comes to capturing detailed land value and specific metrics like infrastructure, building, or capital stock, DIVA primarily provides generalized economic assessments rather than detailed, localized data.
> 
> Here's a brief rundown of how DIVA typically approaches these aspects:
> 
> 1. **Land Value**: DIVA uses aggregated economic data to estimate land value at a regional or national level. These are based on broader economic indicators and assessments rather than fine-grained local valuations.
> 
> 2. **Infrastructure and Capital Stock**: DIVA may incorporate some generalized data on infrastructure and capital stock by using proxies like GDP, economic activity, and land use types. These are typically not as disaggregated as other datasets that focus specifically on infrastructure.
> 
> 3. **Integration with Other Data**: For users needing detailed assessments, DIVA can be integrated or complemented with more localized datasets or economic models to refine estimates of land value and capital stock.
> 
> In summary, while DIVA is incredibly useful for broad vulnerability assessments and scenario analysis in coastal regions, it does not natively provide high-resolution data on specific infrastructure or capital stock details. For those insights, itâ€™s often necessary to supplement DIVA data with specialized datasets or models focusing on economic and infrastructure specifics.
