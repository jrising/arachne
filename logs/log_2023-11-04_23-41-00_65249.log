**user**:
> I am trying to use speechSynthesis in javascript. When I use it from the console, it works fine. But when I use it in response to an async function, I hear nothing:
> sendText(final_transcript).then(textout => {
> 		const utterThis = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(textout);
> 		synth.speak(utterThis);
> 	    }).catch(error => console.error(error));
**assistant**:
> The issue can possibly be related to certain browsers, which have restrictions on the `SpeechSynthesis` API meant to prevent it from being abused (like making automatic sounds when a web page loads). One common restriction is that `SpeechSynthesis.speak()` must be triggered as a direct response to a user action, such as a click or keypress event.
> 
> In your case, even though you're triggering it in response to an async/await Promise, it might not count as a direct user action in the context of the browser. 
> 
> One workaround is to start the speech synthesis during a user action and pause it immediately. Then, when your Promise resolves, you can resume the speech synthesis:
> 
> ```javascript
> let synth = window.speechSynthesis;
> let utterThis = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(" ");
> synth.speak(utterThis);
> synth.pause(); // pause immediately after starting
> 
> sendText(final_transcript).then(textout => {
>     synth.resume(); // Resume the speech
>     utterThis.text = textout; // Update the text
> }).catch(error => console.error(error)); 
> ```
> 
> This will let the browser know that the speech synthesis is initiated by a direct user action, which can help bypass the restrictions in many scenarios. However, due to the evolving nature of restrictions in different browsers, this workaround may not work in all cases or in future browser updates.
> 
> You could also consider providing a visual feedback (such as a spinner, loading bar, etc.) while processing the async function, which can improve the user experience by making it clear that the function is being processed.
**user**:
> I want the speech synthesis to occur in response to the onend event on a speech recognition. Is it possible that this is not considered a user action? Is there a way to do this?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it is possible that the `onend` event of the speech recognition might not be considered a user action by the browser. As a result, the speech synthesis may not work directly from within the `onend` event handler. However, there's a workaround you can try.
> 
> Instead of directly triggering the speech synthesis from the `onend` event, you can use a secondary function that is triggered by the event, which then initiates the speech synthesis. This will ensure that the speech synthesis is triggered by a direct user action.
> 
> Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:
> 
> ```javascript
> function startSpeechSynthesis(text) {
>   const utterThis = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
>   synth.speak(utterThis);
> }
> 
> recognition.onend = function(event) {
>   const final_transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
>   sendText(final_transcript).then(textout => {
>     startSpeechSynthesis(textout);
>   }).catch(error => console.error(error));
> };
> ```
> 
> In this example, the `startSpeechSynthesis` function is called within the `onend` event handler, which is triggered by a direct user action. The `textout` value from the resolved Promise is then passed to the `startSpeechSynthesis` function to initiate the speech synthesis.
> 
> By using this separate function, you should be able to ensure that the speech synthesis is triggered properly in response to the `onend` event of the speech recognition, while still satisfying the browser's requirement for a direct user action.
