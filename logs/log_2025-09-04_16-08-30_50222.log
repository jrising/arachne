> How can I use the listings package to show code in R within a LaTeX file? Specifically, I have a case where I want to write `\lstinline{rbar <- 200:900}`, but the formatting of that is very strange-- the < is huge, and the space before the 200 has disappeared.

> The `listings` package in LaTeX is a great tool for including and formatting code within your documents. To use it effectively for R code, you need to set up the package to understand R's syntax properly. You're running into an issue with the `\lstinline` command likely due to the font and how `<-` is being interpreted as a special LaTeX character.

> 1. Begin by including the `listings` package in your LaTeX document's preamble:

>     \usepackage{listings}
>     ```

> 2. Set up a language option for R. You can define a custom style to ensure the correct handling of symbols and ensure that the space formatting is preserved:

>     ```latex
>     \lstdefinelanguage{R}%
>     {morekeywords={if,else,repeat,while,function,for,in,next,break},%
>     otherkeywords={TRUE,FALSE,NULL,Inf,NaN,NA,NA_integer_,NA_real_,NA_complex_,NA_character_},%
>     sensitive=true,%
>     morecomment=[l]#,%
>     morestring=[b]",%
>     morestring=[b]',%
>     basicstyle=\ttfamily,%
>     keywordstyle=\bfseries,%
>     commentstyle=\itshape\color{gray},%
>     stringstyle=\color{blue}%
>     }
> 
>     \lstset{language=R, 
>             columns=fixed, % Ensures consistent spacing
>             keepspaces=true, % Keeps the spaces in the code
>             basicstyle=\ttfamily\small} % Sets the basic style for code

> 3. Use the `lstinline` command to include your code snippet inline. However, to get it to behave nicely (and given that it sometimes has trouble with special symbols), you might want to use `\texttt{}` as a workaround for very short pieces of code:
> 
>     ```latex
>     \texttt{rbar <- 200:900}
>     ```
> 
> For longer or multiple lines of R code, you should consider using a `lstlisting` environment:
> 
> ```latex
> \begin{lstlisting}
> rbar <- 200:900
> # Here is a comment in R
> plot(rbar)
> \end{lstlisting}
> ```
> 
> This setup should handle your requirements and render R code properly in your LaTeX document. If you continue to have issues with specific symbols or formatting, double-check the options within `lstset` and adjust the character handling rules as needed.
