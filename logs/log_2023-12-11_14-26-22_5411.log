**user**:
> In Julia, I am reading a CSV file that contains a row for each country and some parameters, which I can use to produce a value for each of several future time periods for each country. My goal is to construct a matrix with a row for each time period and a column for each country (I have lists of these time periods and countries.
> 
> Since the data for the matrix needs to be calculated from the values, I think I want to do this by starting with an empty matrix and then adding rows one at a time, as vectors. How can I approach this problem.

**assistant**:
> You can indeed create an empty matrix and add rows iteratively in Julia. Here's a step by step guide on how you can approach this:
> 
> 1. **Create an empty matrix**: You can use the `Matrix{T}` function to create an empty matrix. Assume `n` is your number of countries and `m` is the number of time periods. If your matrix will contain integers, you would initialize it as such:
> 
> ```julia
> data = Matrix{Int}(undef, m, n)
> ```
> 
> If you plan to use float values in your matrix, you should initialize it with `Float64` instead of `Int`. 
> 
> 2. **Read the CSV file**: To read the CSV files in Julia, you'll have to use the `CSV.read()` function from `CSV.jl`.
> 
> ```julia
> using CSV
> 
> df = CSV.read("path/to/your/csv/file.csv", DataFrame)
> ```
> 
> 3. **Add rows to the matrix**: To add rows to your matrix, you would basically assign the calculated values for each country (column) for a specific time period to the appropriate row:
> 
> ```julia
> # Assuming calculate_values is a function that calculates needed values
> # and country_list is an ordered list of all countries.
> 
> for (i, time_period) in enumerate(time_periods_list)
>     for (j, country) in enumerate(country_list)
>         value = calculate_values(df, time_period, country)  # define a separate function for this calculation
>         data[i, j] = value
>     end
> end
> ```
> Remember to replace `calculate_values` with your actual function that calculates the values based on the parameters for each country and time period.
> 
> Finally, remember to replace the file path, country list and time periods list with your actual data.
> 
> Another crucial point is that Julia is one-indexed, unlike many other programming languages that are zero-indexed. This is helpful to remember when you're placing the elements in the correct indices in your matrix.
