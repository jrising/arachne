Some of these are covered in the introductory text; but they are presented by way of justification rather than a balanced comparison (see section G, below). Specifics points – illustrative, rather than comprehensive – include:
> % • The contingency of robustness of results upon underlying data and assumptions are not as clear as they are in the more developed field of process-based crop modelling. Admittedly, those contingencies are not often made explicit; but the decades of research with these methods mean that they are largely understood. A clear presentation of contingencies, perhaps even as a detailed comparison of pros and cons against process-based methods in an appendix, would greatly improve confidence in the results of the study, and in the underlying methods.

**assistant**:
> The phrase "contingency of robustness" refers to the idea that the reliability, validity, and strength ("robustness") of the results from an analysis or model depend upon ("are contingent upon") certain factors. In this context, the reviewer is saying that the robustness of the results of an econometric approach to estimating crop yields can change depending on the quality of the underlying data and the assumptions made.
> 
> For instance, if the econometric model is based on robust and comprehensive data and sound assumptions, the results may be very reliable and valid. But if the model uses incomplete or poor-quality data, or if the assumptions do not hold up, the robustness (i.e., the strength and reliability) of the results might be lower.

> In a way, the reviewer is asking for a more explicit acknowledgment and discussion of these dependencies to not only understand potential limitations in this new approach, but also to be able to compare it more fairly with the established method of process-based crop modelling.
