> I am writing an interim report describing improvements I am making to the PAGE model. The description below is from a previous paper, describing the current (prior to my changes) state of the model:
> ---
> The PAGE-ICE model (Yumashev et al 2019) simulates climatic and economic developments between 2020 and 2300 in eight aggregated regions (appendix A.1) and extends PAGE09, building on a decade of scientific progress through improved representations of climatic processes and economic damages (figure 1). In particular, PAGE-ICE implements detailed models of Arctic feedbacks, consisting of permafrost thawing, and sea ice and land snow albedo changes. It also updates the climate representation to conform to parameters in the IPCC AR5 (Stocker et al 2013), and offers a wide range of consistent combined emissions and socioeconomic pathways. PAGE-ICE models temperature responses and greenhouse gas cycles including feedbacks for six emissions classes (CO2, CH4, N2O, linear gases, sulphates, and a residual group for other greenhouse gas emissions). Global temperatures are scaled to the eight represented regions, before considering economic impacts (more detail in model documentation and supplementary information of Yumashev et al 2019). Economic damages due to rising temperatures are calibrated based on historic data and capture the heterogeneous response of countries to warming (Burke et al 2015), but the original PAGE-ICE does not simulate damage persistence. Thus, the economy always returns to the exogenous economic growth path, no matter how high the contemporary damages.

> Figure 1. Illustrative sketch of changes and extensions to PAGE-ICE presented in this paper. (a) Changes in the climate representation. PAGE-ICE includes a more detailed representation of CO2 and CH4 sinks, permafrost carbon feedback, the effect of sea ice and land snow decline on surface albedo, and a fat-tailed distribution of sea level rise. Here we also include interannual temperature variability with a temperature feedback through annual auto-correlation. (b) Changes in the damage module. The PAGE-ICE discontinuity damage component was reduced to correspond with updates to climate tipping points and sea-level rise risk, and market damages were recalibrated to an empirical estimate based on temperatures. Thus, while the discontinuity and non-economic damages continue to be calculated based on the separation between tolerable and excess temperature, the market damages are now calculated based on absolute temperature. Here we also extend PAGE-ICE with the possibility of persistent climate-induced damages, which in turn affects GDP pathways and scales emissions accordingly (feedback loop in the figure).

> 2.1. Model setup
> Our setup recognizes that deterministic assessments of the SCCO2 carry only very limited information. PAGE-ICE uses Monte Carlo sampling of over 150 parameter distributions (Yumashev et al 2019) to provide distributions of the results. All results presented use 50 000 Monte Carlo draws (and 100 000 for PAGE09, using @RISK within Excel), with draws taken from the same superset to be able to compare SCCO2 distributions across models. The PAGE-ICE model has been translated into the Mimi modeling framework, using the same validation process as for Mimi-PAGE (Moore et al 2018). Model code and documentation are available from the GitHub repository, https://github.com/openmodels/MimiPAGE2020.jl.
> 
> To estimate the marginal damage of an additional tonne of CO2, PAGE-ICE is run twice, with one run following the exogenously specified emission pathway and the second run adding a CO2 pulse. The SCCO2 is then calculated as the difference in global equity-weighted damages between those two runs divided by the pulse size, discounted to the base year (2015). Equity weighting of damages follows the approach by Anthoff et al (2009a) using a mean (minimum, maximum) elasticity of marginal utility of consumption of 1.17 (0.1–2.0), and equity-weighted damages are discounted using a pure time preference rate of 1.03% (0.5%, 2.0%). For all our results, we rely on a 75Gt pulse size in the first time period of PAGE-ICE (mid-2017–2025), representing an annual pulse size of 10 Gt CO2. In this setup, we found that the choice of pulse size can have an effect on the SCCO2 estimates, and we explore these sensitivities in appendix A.2, alongside a general sensitivity analysis of PAGE-ICE's model parameters in appendix A.3.
> 
> 2.2. Scenarios
> We provide results for a selection of scenarios across climate outcomes and socioeconomic developments, based on the Tier 1 scenarios of ScenarioMIP (O'Neill et al 2016). SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 are generally well aligned with the Paris Agreement (IPCC 2018, Rogelj et al 2018), while SSP5-8.5 features very high radiative forcing and rapid GDP growth. The 'middle-of-the-road' socioeconomic pathway SSP2 is combined with the emission pathway RCP4.5 scenario for the central values presented in this analysis. Since reference SSP scenarios are provided until 2100, we extend these by making the assumption that regional GDP per capita and population growth rates in the different model regions converge toward the global mean. We implement this by defining a region's post-2100 growth rate as $ g_{r, t} = (1 - DR - CR) \cdot g_{r, t-1} + CR \cdot \bar{g}_{t-1} $, where CR and DR are the respective universal rates of convergence and decay, and $\bar{g}$ is the global mean growth rate. The subscripts $r,t$ represent region and time period, respectively. We fit the convergence and decay rates based on SSP growth rates up to 2100 using Stan, a Bayesian MCMC system (appendix A.5).
> 
> 2.3. Persistence of damages
> We implement the persistence parameter following Estrada et al (2015) into the growth system of Burke et al (2015) such that: $\mathrm{GDP}_{r,t} = \mathrm{GDP}_{r,t-1} \cdot (1 + g_{r,t} - \rho \cdot \gamma_{r,t-1})$, where g is the growth rate, γ represents the contemporary economic damages in % of GDP returned by the market damage function and ρ specifies the share of economic damages that persist and thus alter the growth trajectory in the long run. Note that this approach nests the extreme assumptions of zero persistence usually made in CB-IAMs and the assumption of full persistence from the empirical literature (Burke et al 2015, Ricke et al 2018) for ρ = 0 and ρ = 1, respectively. For consistency with the underlying RCP-SSP scenarios, we also rescale greenhouse gas emissions proportionally to the change in GDP, such that emission intensities of economic output remain unchanged. To estimate the distribution of ρ, we calculate the ratio of the long-run marginal impact of temperature on economic growth to the immediate marginal impact using the historical panel data by Burke et al (2015) (appendix B.3). For estimating the long-run marginal impact, we follow the literature in estimating regression models featuring temperature lags (Dell et al 2012, Burke et al 2015), and we additionally apply a more recent approach using low-pass filtering by Bastien-Olvera and Moore (2021) for robustness checks (appendix B.4).
> 
> For our aggregated analysis, we do not include any sectoral distinction for the persistence parameter ρ since PAGE-ICE models economic damages on the aggregated macro level using the damage function by Burke et al (2015). By taking one global value distribution for the ρ parameter, we assume that the persistence of damages is similar in each region modeled. Reduced significance for non-global estimates of partial persistence hinders the use of region-specific parameters. For all central results, damage persistence also remains constant over time following from the limited evidence for successful adaptation to date (Burke et al 2015, Burke and Emerick 2016). We explore these simplifications in detail in appendix B.5, where we consider a case that sees economically persistent damages only in lower-income regions, following suggestive evidence for regional heterogeneity, for instance due to higher climate vulnerability and reduced adaptive capacity (Byers et al 2018, Andrijevic et al 2020). Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of possible future adaptation reducing the persistence of temperature impacts on GDP (see also appendix B.6).

> 2.4. PAGE with annual temperature variability
> To allow for modeling annual temperature anomalies, the inputs to the temperature and GDP modules of PAGE are annualized by a combination of exponential interpolation for population, sea-level rise, and abatement costs, and linear interpolation for GDP growth rates. Annualized temperatures are subsequently used for calculating the damages on an annual basis for the non-market, market, and discontinuity modules. Sea-level rise and consequent damages are modelled to depend on the global climatic mean temperatures modeled in PAGE-ICE, rather than annual on mean temperatures.
> 
> There is no strong evidence for the increase or decrease in global annual temperature variability with global mean temperature increases (Huntingford et al 2013, Sippel et al 2015). Therefore, we model the magnitude of interannual temperature variability to be constant over time, based on the analysis of regional means in a recent spatially complete dataset (Ilyas et al 2017) that is suitable for the analysis of temperature variability because its underlying statistical simulation approach allows for a more adequate approximation of the expected local variability and its uncertainty (Beguería et al 2016). We model global (1a ) and regional (1b ) temperature variability as follows:
> 
> Equation (1a)
> Equation (1b)
> here, T is the realized annual temperature, Θ is the mean temperature realized in the PAGE climate module prior to variability, σ is the standard deviation of internal variability, and the subscripts $g,r,t$ represent global, regional, and time (in years). In the absence of auto-regressive feedback, $\alpha_g = \alpha_r = \gamma_g = \gamma_r = 0$, $\beta_g = 1$, and $\beta_r = AF_r$, the regional amplification factor from PAGE-ICE. The temporal standard deviations σ are derived from annual spatially aggregated regional mean temperatures. These regional temperatures are derived from median gridded observations of 10 000 statistical ensemble members (Ilyas et al 2017), which are area-weighted and linearly detrended for a 30 year climatic period. Further information including uncertainties in these observations are found in appendix C.1. With auto-regression, we fit all parameters to historical temperatures using least-squares regression, and applying a LOESS of global temperatures as $\Theta_{gt}$ (appendix C.2). As a robustness check, we include a simple alternative implementation of variability (appendix C.3).
