**user**:
> How do I list all variables in an xarray ds?
**assistant**:
> You can obtain a list of all variable names in an xarray DataSet `ds` by using the `keys()` method on the DataSet's `data_vars` attribute. This attribute is a dictionary-like container of the DataSet's dependent variables. The `keys()` method extracts the variable names. Here's the code:
> 
> ```python
> variable_names = list(ds.data_vars.keys())
> ```
> 
> This code will give you a list, `variable_names`, where each entry is the name of a variable in your DataSet `ds`.
> 
> Alternatively, you could simply print the xarray DataSet `ds` to the console to see a summary including the variable names:
> 
> ```python
> print(ds)
> ```
> 
> This will provide more detailed information, not just the variable names, but also the corresponding dimensions and data types.
**user**:
> When I just do print(ds), some of the variables are missing because there are 18, and only 12 print (there's an elipses in the middle).
**assistant**:
> If not all variables are being displayed when you use the `print(ds)` command because there are too many variables to fit in the console window, you can adjust the maximum number of displayed variables by changing the `expand_repr` option. By default, `expand_repr` is set to `True`, which causes the representation of the Dataset to be truncated with an ellipsis (`...`) if there are too many variables.
> 
> To change the `expand_repr` option to display all variables, you can set it explicitly to `True` before printing the DataSet:
> 
> ```python
> import xarray as xr
> 
> xr.set_options(keep_attrs=True, expand_repr=True)
> print(ds)
> ```
> 
> This will ensure that `print(ds)` displays all variables without truncation.
> 
> Note that setting `expand_repr` to `True` may result in a large amount of output if your DataSet has many variables, so it's recommended to use it only when necessary.
