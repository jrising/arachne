**assistant**:
> "Implementation Science" is a field of research that studies the methods to promote the incorporation of research findings and evidence into healthcare practice and policy. In the context of your grant proposal, it refers to strategies that will aid the actual execution of techniques and programs that the project will develop. This could involve understanding the local health care context, user behavior, and systems factors that may facilitate or obstruct the uptake of the new intervention.
> 
> "Decision Science for Policy Makers," on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary approach grounded in economics, psychology, and systems analysis to evaluate the complex, often competing, factors that inform decision-making at the policy level. It involves creating models and frameworks that help policy makers visualize potential outcomes, prioritize objectives, manage risk, and make informed choices. 
> 
> In the context of this grant proposal, it might mean developing tools or models that help NGOs and local community staff make better decisions in response to changing health conditions, geographical changes, or early-warning system signals.
