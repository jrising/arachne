> Does Delmarva Power use demand pricing, based on the highest usage over a given period? Or would PJM, the grid manager, be the one to do it?
**assistant**:
> Delmarva Power, like many utility companies, does incorporate some form of demand pricing or demand charges, particularly for commercial and industrial customers. These charges are typically based on the highest level of electricity usage during a peak period, which helps manage the strain on the grid during high demand times.
> 
> Demand pricing can also be influenced by PJM Interconnection, which operates the electricity grid in the Delaware area along with several other states. PJM is responsible for ensuring reliability and managing wholesale electricity prices in the region. They orchestrate demand response programs that may affect how utilities like Delmarva structure their rates, including demand charges.
