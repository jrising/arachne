**assistant**:
> Yes, your equation suggests that the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is inversely proportional to the discount rate. 
> 
> In words, you could say: "The SCC is inversely related to the discount rate, such that if you hold everything else constant, increasing the discount rate decreases the SCC, and decreasing the discount rate increases the SCC. Specifically, the ratio of the SCC under two different scenarios is approximately the inverse of the ratio of their discount rates." 
> 
> In practical terms, this relationship highlights how using a lower discount rate places greater emphasis on the long-term impacts of carbon emissions, thereby increasing the calculated SCC, while a higher discount rate diminishes those impacts and lowers the SCC.

**user**:
> Well, but I still want to communicate that the ratios follow inversely.
