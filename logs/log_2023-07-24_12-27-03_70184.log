**assistant**:
> Yes, indeed, there are several ways to reduce the size of an ESRI shapefile in QGIS beyond just simplifying polygons. Some of these methods can be performed together to further optimize the file size:
> 
> 1. **Reduce Attribute Data:** Clear out any unnecessary attribute data. The attributes of a shapefile can often take up as much space as the geometry itself. Limiting the number of attributes can greatly reduce the file size.
> 
> 2. **Converting Data Types:** If the attribute table contains numerical values stored as strings i.e. text data, you could convert these data types to integer or float values where applicable. This can lead to significant reduction in file size.
> 
> 3. **Spatially Subset the Data:** Removing unnecessary geographic areas can reduce file sizes. This could mean removing parts of the data that are not within your geographic area of interest.
> 
> 4. **Resampling Rasters:** If the dataset includes raster information, consider resampling them to a lower resolution.
> 
> 5. **File Compression:** Although QGIS does not directly compress shapefiles, you can use external tools to compress the shapefile into a .zip file. The .zip file can be directly loaded into QGIS, and offers significant reductions in disk space usage.
> 
> 6. **File Conversion:** Consider converting your shapefile to a more size-efficient file format, such as GeoPackage (*.gpkg) or spatially indexed format like SpatialLite or PostGIS.
> 
> Each of these methods has trade-offs, so consider your needs carefully before implementing.
