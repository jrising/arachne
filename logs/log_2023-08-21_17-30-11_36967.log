> - Wastewater outfall pipes (there are several in upper bay and two along coast)
> - Other Pipeline Areas (again, several in the upper bay, a few at the mouth of the bay)
> - Submarine Cable Areas (several in the upper bay and near the mouth; also pipes that cut through the planning area further out to sea).

> Wastewater outfall pipes:
> This database shows the location of publicly owned treatment works, and other significant point source discharges to surface waters at or near the contiguous U.S. coastline. Three types of features are provided in this database: facility location, outfall pipes, and the outfall discharge point. Outfall pipes and discharge points may not be present for some facilities due to a lack of source data. A facility can be linked to its outfall pipe, discharge point, and other National Pollution Discharge Elimination System records using the provided key field.

> Other Pipeline Areas:
> These data show the general location of pipelines within U.S. waters. The geographic footprint for each pipeline may vary and is dependent on the original source data. In the near shore, pipelines are routinely buried below the seabed. Offshore, they are placed directly on the seabed. A pipeline area may contain one or more physical pipelines, and 30 CFR 585.301 defines a minimum 100-foot-wide right of way grant on each side of a pipeline.

> Submarine Cable Areas:
> These data show the general location of commercial and research submarine cables within U.S. waters. The majority of these cables are for telecommunications, and the remaining are for power transmission. The geographic footprint for each cable may vary and is dependent on the original source data. In the near shore, cables are routinely buried below the seabed. Offshore, they are placed directly on the seabed. A submarine cable area may contain one or more physical cables, and 30 CFR 585.301 defines a minimum 100-foot-wide right of way grant on each side of a cable.

> ## Current and Potential Activities in Delaware Marine Waters: Infrastructure Impact - Pipes and Submarine Cables
> 
> ### Introduction
> 
> As we explore the current and potential activities in the Delaware marine waters, it's essential to understand the influence of existing infrastructures such as wastewater outfall pipes, other pipe areas, and submarine cables. The presence and characteristics of these infrastructures may significantly impact the marine environment and the activities taking place therein. 
> 
> ### Wastewater Outfall Pipes
> 
> These are essential components of the public treatment systems, discharging treated effluent into the marine environment near the coastline. They are predominantly located in the upper bay and along the coast. Not all facilities have documented outfall pipes or discharge points due to data limitations. It's crucial to consider these facilities and their discharge areas as they represent significant sources of potential pollution that can impact other activities in the area.
> 
> ### Other Pipeline Areas
> 
> These areas, primarily located in the upper bay and mouth of the bay, include one or more pipelines that transport various substances. Depending on their proximity to the shore, these pipelines are either buried below the seabed or placed directly on it. The pipelines' activities impact their surroundings due to their 200-foot-wide footprint (including the 100-foot-wide right of way grant on both sides). Considering these pipelines and their routes is vital due to their potential interference with other offshore activities and their possible environmental implications.
> 
> ### Submarine Cable Areas
> 
> Submarine cables are primarily used for telecommunication purposes, with a minority used for power transmission. These cables, distributed in the upper bay and near the bay mouth, and extending further out to sea, can potentially impact marine life and other sea-based activities. Just like pipelines, these cables are buried below the seabed near the shore and placed directly on the seabed offshore. The areas they cover, including the 100-foot-wide right of way grant on both sides, may affect other offshore activities.
> 
> ### Overall Impact
> 
> The wastewater outfall pipes, other pipeline areas, and submarine cable areas are key infrastructures in Delaware marine waters that can significantly influence both current and planned activities. Understanding where these infrastructures are located and the spatial area they cover can assist in planning potential activities while preserving marine health and maintaining existing service provision. Therefore, comprehensive mapping and continuous updating of this information are necessary for sound decision-making regarding new projects or environmental conservation measures in these areas.
