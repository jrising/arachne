> On a piano score, I see a note marked as flat, and then the same note repeated, unmarked. Is the flat repeated? Elsewhere, I sometimes see a note marked and then marked natural in a repeat.
**assistant**:
> In standard music notation, accidentals like flats, sharps, and naturals apply to all subsequent instances of that note within the same measure, unless otherwise indicated. So if a note is marked as flat, all occurrences of that note in the same measure are also flat, unless there is a natural sign or another accidental that alters it. In the next measure, unless it's marked again, it returns to its original pitch (natural). 
> 
> The natural sign appears when you want the note to return to its natural pitch within the same measure after an accidental has been applied to previous notes of the same pitch. It serves as a cancellation of the previous accidental.

> What does a c with a vertical line through it mean at the beginning of a piece?
**assistant**:
> A "C" with a vertical line through it at the beginning of a piece is a symbol for "cut time" or "alla breve." It indicates that the piece should be played in a 2/2 time signature rather than the more common 4/4 time signature. In cut time, the half note gets one beat, and there are two beats per measure. This allows for a brisk tempo, often used in faster dance music or tempos that require a lighter feel.

> If you see this symbol, be prepared to count in half notes instead of quarter notes! Let me know if you need further clarification or have more questions.
