> I am running anova on an lm model in R. I expected the sum of the Sum Sq column to be approximately equal to the sum of squares of the dependent variable, under the law of total variance. But it's like 5% of that value, so I must be misunderstanding something. How do I find out how big the "interaction" effect is that would make the variable of the terms not equal to the variance of the total.

> In a linear model (lm) in R, when you run an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the sum of the 'Sum Sq' column typically refers to the sum of squares for each factor, or grouping variable, in the model, also known as Type I SS. The total sum of squares is the sum of the regression sum of squares (the 'Sum Sq' column) and the residual sum of squares (the unexplained variance, i.e., the 'Residuals' row in the ANOVA output).
> 
> If the 'Sum Sq' is only 5% of the total sum of squares, this suggests that your model is only explaining a small fraction of the variability in your dependent variable.
> 
> To understand how interaction effects are contributing to this, you first need to make sure you've included interaction terms in your model. In R, you can do this using the * operator, for example `lm(Y ~ X1*X2, data = your_dataframe)` will include main effects for X1 and X2 and their interaction X1:X2.
> 
> When you run `anova()` on this model, you will see an entry for each main effect and interaction effect. The 'Sum Sq' for the interaction term (X1:X2 in our example) gives the sum of squares explained by the interaction effect. If this is a large proportion of the total, it suggests that the relationship between your predictors and the dependent variable changes depending on the level of the other predictor.
> 
> However, make sure you're using correct model for your underlying data structure. If factors are significantly related, Type III SS is recommended which actually assesses the contribution of each factor after accounting for the others.
> 
> You can calculate Type III SS by using the `Anova()` function in `car` package and specify `type = "III"`. For instance,
> 
> ```R
> library(car)
> Anova(lm(Y ~ X1*X2, data = your_dataframe), type = "III")
> ```
> 
> Also, keep in mind that the sum of all these 'Sum Sq' entries might not exactly equal the total variability in the dependent variable because of model assumptions not being fully met, such as non-linearity, outliers, or other sources of unmodeled variability. It's always good to check your model residuals and other assumptions when interpreting your ANOVA results.
