**user**:
> What is it called when you put your house on stilts to avoid flooding?
**assistant**:
> The process of lifting an existing house off its foundation and securing it on stilts or an elevated platform to mitigate against flooding is typically called "house lifting" or "house raising." This practice is commonly used in flood-prone areas, as it reduces the risk of water-related damage to the home.
