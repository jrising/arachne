> There are several reasons why it is difficult to produce comprehensive climate risks estimates for poor countries. One reason is that these countries often have limited data on their current climate and potential future climate changes, making it difficult to accurately model and predict the impacts of climate change. Additionally, many poor countries have limited resources and infrastructure, making them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation patterns. Furthermore, poor countries often have weaker governance and institutions, which can make it difficult to effectively plan for and respond to climate change. Finally, the lack of reliable data on economic and social indicators in poor countries can make it hard to estimate the economic and social impacts of climate change.
