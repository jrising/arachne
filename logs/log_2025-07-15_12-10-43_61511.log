> Economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK, and benefits of adaptation action
> 
> Organisational Background:
> This project brings together expertise from multiple institutions, drawing upon top experts and models from the UK and beyond. This consortium, which will continue to grow beyond the project period, is a valuable outcome of the grant, as a vital foundation for future work. The project lead is James Rising, Visiting Fellow to the  Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), which will coordinate the project. Established in 2008, GRI is a multidisciplinary centre, bringing together expertise on economics, finance, geography, the environment, science, law, international relations, development and political science. GRI exists to accelerate the transition to a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world by conducting world-class research, engaging with stakeholders worldwide, and educating future professionals. Chaired by Professor Lord Nicholas Stern, GRI is recognized internationally for its leadership in climate policy and was awarded the 2021 Queen’s Anniversary Prize for its significant contributions to climate economics and policy.
> 
> High-Level Framing and Problem Statement:
> Climate change poses significant economic and fiscal risks to the United Kingdom, threatening both short-term stability and long-term prosperity. At the same time, future impacts depend on proactive adaptation, resilience in communities and in the financial system, and accurate targeting of public funds. This project addresses the urgent need for comprehensive, UK-specific climate damage scenarios that inform fiscal policy and adaptation strategies, based upon a flexible framework that can be updated over time as new evidence emerges and which is available to test assumptions and sensitivities. It also acts as a pioneering study internationally, offering an approach that can be adapted to other countries.
> 
> The Problem: Current models, such as those used by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios, lack the specificity required to address the UK’s unique geography and economic structure and overlook complex risk channels, including international spillovers. Additionally, existing assessments, like the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) 2024 report  and the GRI study on UK risks , indicate significant gaps in data related to adaptation costs and benefits, preventing a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities and opportunities for proactive measures. While the GRI study estimated a wide range of impacts, it did not provide a mechanism for continuous updating and use of the results or focus on near-term risks and the associated role of near-term adaptation.
> 
> Therefore, this proposal seeks to integrate sector-specific impacts into a cohesive macroeconomic framework, enabling evidence-based fiscal policy decisions and advancing knowledge on adaptation benefits and costs. This will support strategic decision-making, ensuring the UK efficiently allocates resources to bolster resilience and mitigate economic vulnerabilities from climate-related disturbances.
> 
> This proposal builds upon ongoing efforts, including the GRI study, the Green Finance Institute and University of Oxford’s work on nature-related risks ; the Horizon-funded ACCREU project , and initiatives under UKRI and Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA4). By developing open-source tools and sharing insights, the project will set a precedent for similar work worldwide, and foster a global understanding of adaptation benefits and climate risks.
> 
> Objective:
> The overarching objective of this 12-month proposal is to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the economic and fiscal risks posed by climate damages to the UK, while also evaluating the benefits of adaptation actions. This framework will provide high-resolution insights into macroeconomic impacts, enabling informed decision-making and effective management of climate-related economic and fiscal risks.
> 
> Specifically, the proposal aims to:
> O1: Enhance Understanding of UK Macroeconomic Impacts of Climate Change: Shape the understanding of climate risks and their macroeconomic implications, including international spillovers and costs of autonomous adaptation. Under this objective, we would provide the first comprehensive estimates of the potential implications of physical climate change for the UK across a range of macroeconomic variables (MEVs).
> O2: Advance Quantification of the Fiscal Risks Related to Climate Change: Ensure robust quantification of fiscal impacts stemming from climate damages and adaptation costs, filling any identified gaps in transmission channels, and learning from existing OBR approaches.
> O3: Inform Public Spending Decisions on Climate Adaptation: Provide evidence-based insights to guide funding decisions for adaptation options, ensuring benefits are tracked against an assessment of UK climate damages.
> O4: Facilitate Timely and Adaptive Decision-Making: Create an adaptive framework for incorporating new evidence and insights as they arise, including those from future assessments and open-source tools.
> O5: Convene a Community of Experts on Climate Risks: Provide a framework in which experts and models are brought together in a way that results in better assessments than current structures produce, and act as a resource for UK government policy-making.
> 
> Future Work: O6: Support Global Capacity Building: Assist other countries in addressing climate-related macroeconomic risks by developing open-source tools and sharing insights derived from the UK’s modelling efforts.
> 
> Theory of change and Strategy
> The theory of change is based on the premise that robust, data-driven insights can fundamentally reshape decision-making about climate risks by providing clear, nuanced information on both economic impacts and adaptation benefits.
> 
> ●	Interconnected Data and Models: By providing a comprehensive macroeconomic framework that is populated by synthesizing of sectoral models and collaborating with experts, we will provide both detailed and transparent climate damage scenarios, but also an approach that can learn and adjust over time. 
> ●	Evidence-Based Fiscal Assessment: By rigorously evaluating fiscal implications from climate damages and adaptation costs, our insights will integrate climate considerations into fiscal policy, ensuring resource allocation reflects empirical data.
> ●	Stakeholder Engagement: Establishing a multi-disciplinary advisory group will foster cross-sectoral knowledge sharing, ensuring that findings resonate with policymakers and support a collective action approach.
> ●	Iterative Learning: Constant integration of new data will keep models adaptive to evolving conditions, facilitating ongoing refinement of strategies and ensuring their relevance over time. The macroeconomic framework will also allow the testing of assumptions and sensitivity analyses, facilitating robust risk analyses, policy identification and appraisal. 
> 
> Strategy: To bring this theory of change to life, the strategy will include:
> ●	Collaboration with Experts: Engage leading researchers and policymakers to expand best practices and deepen understanding of adaptation investment needs, including linking to the UK CCRA4 process.
> ●	Transparent Outputs: Ensure modelling processes are transparent, delivering insights in accessible formats like spreadsheets, empowering stakeholders to leverage data effectively.
> ●	Education and Outreach: Communicate findings to government bodies and industry stakeholders, driving adoption of insights and enhancing policy relevancy.
> ●	Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback loops to incorporate stakeholder feedback and new data, refining tools and strategies over time, and ensuring they remain effective in managing the fiscal and economic risks of climate change.
> 
> This strategy will address the identified problems, offering invaluable insights into climate-related economic and fiscal risks, and guiding resilient policy outcomes in the UK.

> Work Programmes
> 
> WP1: Scenario development
> WP1 consists of two related sets of scenarios: Climate and socioeconomic scenarios, used to project impacts, and risk case study scenarios, used as potential financial stress tests.
> 
> Task 1.1: Develop long-term projection scenarios: Global warming levels are key markers to understand risks, but are not sufficient to project climate risks. Future climate impacts depend upon future socioeconomics, including income levels and inequality, population density, and past adaptation decisions, as well as the rate of warming and the pattern of warming domestically and internationally. This task lays out a set of scenarios, backed by broad narratives, and conforming to 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C global warming levels, and an AMOC scenario. These will build on the scenarios developed for the Climate Financial Risk Forum , developed with Met Office support, which combine strong mitigation (SSP1-2.6), moderate mitigation (SSP2-4.5), and backtracking (SSP3-7.0) scenarios with consideration of central and tail-end climate estimates. Results below will focus on 2035, following these long-term trajectories.
> Future work could represent other features of tail climatic risk, including the Labrador-Irminger Seas Convection tipping point and rapid sea-level rise.
> 
> Task 1.2: Case study scenario identification: In this project, case studies that describe potential macroeconomic and financial stress will be derived from a thorough exploration of the space of bottom-up (WP2) and top-down (WP3) risks. We will identify compound events in the projections, across the range of uncertainty and variability. Case studies will combine chronic shifts in climate with unexpected shocks to particular sectors, and explore how these propagate through the economic system, mirroring the approach in Ranger et al. (2024)3. These will be co-designed in consultation with HM Treasury (HMT). Potential case studies will consider (1) agricultural failures leading to price spikes and inflation; (2) a heat wave driving spiraling hospital costs; and (3) a flooding event which results in infrastructure disruption. This task will translate quantitative information into narratives, while Task 4.1 will translate narratives back into quantitative scenarios for integration with the NiGEM model.
> Future work could explicitly represent cascading impacts through quantitative modelling and engage a larger body of stakeholders in the co-design process.
> 
> WP2: Expanding bottom-up economic risks
> WP2 will improve upon the process developed for Rising et al. (2022)2, where results from detailed models are (a) translated into emulators using each model’s underlying climate assumptions, (b) producing damage functions for UK regions according to the underlying models, and then (c) downscaled to high-resolution administrative units across the UK. The key innovations here consist of (1) incorporating adaptation benefits and costs, drawn from multiple sources and (2) incorporating interannual variability to describe near-term (2025-2035) risks.
> 
>  
>  
> Task 2.1: Collect channel-specific model results. Draw upon new literature and collaboration with experts across the UK to develop a robust set of detailed model results. Drawing upon the work of the ACCREU project4 and the Climate Impact Lab  (CIL), we will also collect results on the costs and benefits of (1) autonomous adaptation and income-driven reductions in vulnerability and (2) policy-driven adaptation investment.

Future work will incorporate the channels in italics.
> 
> Task 2.2: Calibrate regional damage functions: Using the approach in Rising et al. (2022), we will fit emulators to the results from Task 2.1. In addition, the relationships between adaptation costs and reductions in vulnerability will be represented as elasticities, allowing us to project damages under any level of social adaptation costs. The reliability of our elasticity approach will be evaluated using bootstrapping, and errors introduced in extrapolating elasticities will be translated into adaptation uncertainty.
> Future work could separately model different types of investments, rather than considering a single aggregate adaptation cost relationship, and account for interdependencies that adaptation approaches have across multiple risks.
> 
> Task 2.3: Projection of domestic biophysical impacts and damages: Domestic impacts and GDP-equivalent damages will be projected under the scenarios from Task 1.1 at high resolution across the UK and annually. Annual impacts will account for uncertainty in individual years, to evaluate extreme risks. This would be prepared as a public data product with interactive maps.
> Future work could build upon the methods from OBR’s FRS24 to estimate fiscal risks, and expand the understanding of financial risks to include insurance and business-side risk.
> WP3: Incorporating adaptation into top-down risks
> Econometric studies have greatly increased our understanding of the impact temperatures and other weather variables have on GDP growth. NGFS currently uses one of these results, from Kotz et al. (2024) , to describe financial risks. However, the NGFS approach misses important evidence. (a) The number of studies that have explored this relationship is rapidly increasing with very different assumptions, and we will use a meta-analysis approach, developed by Rising & Tahmid (WP) , to develop a best-estimate of top-down risks. (b) A number of studies show that impacts to GDP growth are persistent beyond the lower-bound used in Kotz et al., and we will model the uncertainty around these explicitly. (c) Estimates in this literature do not include risks related to sea-level rise, which we will add on. (d) These estimates structurally exclude effects from international interactions, which we will incorporate using a trade model (possibly also NiGEM).
> 
> Task 3.1: Model macro-econometric growth losses: While Rising & Tahmid (WP)9 study the effects of macroeconomic losses from 9 models in this historical period, we will project these damages into the future using the scenarios from Task 1.1, across all countries.
> Future work could incorporate information from expert elicitation of damages, from Howard & Sterner (2017)  and Moore et al. (2024) , and globally-correlated losses from Bilal & Känzig (2024) .
> 
> Task 3.2: Meta-analysis of macro-econometric results: The meta-analysis will synthesise information from the models studied in Task 3.1 to produce a best-estimate of future GDP losses. This approach uses machine learning as developed in Rising & Tahmid (WP)9, and translates draws upon the different results from different study approaches to construct losses that are robustly likely to be estimated from a gold-standard approach.
> 
> Using the best estimate, we will project damages into the future accounting for uncertainty. These will then be input into the NiGEM model to understand how trade will result in risk spillovers for the UK.
> Future work could incorporate “error term” information to explore the variability around impacts, rather than just the expected loss level.
> 
> Task 3.3: Translating GDP loss to UK risk: The GDP losses produced by Task 3.2 require further work to translate into UK risks. While NiGEM produces these spillover effects, we construct a parallel set of UK risk estimates here, to provide the full data coverage needed for Task 5.1. This task follows the steps in Rising and Tahmid (WP)9 (1) translating GDP shocks into persistent GDP losses using a model of economic persistence; (2) incorporating market losses from sea-level rise and coastal storms using the high-resolution using pyCIAM and (3) translating reductions in GDP across the globe to reductions in UK GDP from trade spill-overs, using the Eora26 MRIO model.
> Future work could use a empirically-estimated dynamic vulnerability approach, developed for the PAGE integrated assessment model , to incorporate adaptation into GDP growth effects.
> 
> WP4: Macroeconomic framework integration
> WP4 will combine information from WP2 and WP3 and translate it into inputs appropriate for the NiGEM model, following the approach used in Ranger et al. (2024)3. This is conceived as an iteration with WP1 and a collaboration with NIESR.
> 
> Task 4.1: Elaborate case study scenarios: After case studies have been identified and described across the space of potential risks in Task 1.2, this task will translate those risks into quantitative impacts for the NiGEM macroeconomic model, engaging with NIESR to implement the sector-specific dynamics. This will again use the results from WP2 and WP3 (as in Task 1.2), but draw specifically from results that correspond to the narratives.
> Future work could perform an iterative modelling process, incorporating cascading risk information, whereby the narratives and quantitative representations are developed through repeated stakeholder engagement.
> 
> Task 4.2: Analyse NiGEM results: The results from NiGEM will further inform the narrative process in WP1, and highlight avenues for improvement. The key outcome of the NiGEM integration under this task is a clearer understanding of financial and macroeconomic risks resulting from the narratives.
> Future work could expand the range of scenarios input into the NiGEM model to improve the tool development process in Task 5.1.
> 
> WP5: Adaptation policy development
> WP5 will translate results from WPs 2, 3, and 4 into an easy-to-use, flexible tool, ready for use by groups like HMT. The main goals of this tool are (1) the ability to quickly explore new scenarios of domestic and trade-related risks; (2) the ability to propose and analyse adaptation investment plans; and (3) the production of sectoral and macroeconomic impacts that can be input into models like NiGEM for further analysis.
> 
> Task 5.1: Co-develop a flexible tool: The flexible tool will take the form of a sophisticated spreadsheet, incorporating @RISK Monte Carlo simulations. It would include (1) the projection scenarios produced in WP1, with the ability to adjust their assumptions; (2) the emulated relationships produced in WP2 for multiple bottom-up risks; (3) the trade spillover risks produced by incorporating top-down risks from WP2 into macroeconomic modelling under WP4. It would also include options to design sophisticated adaptation scenarios, consisting of channel-specific investments. The process for updating risk relationships and adding new ones will be simple and clearly documented. The flexible tool would produce tables and figures, as well as damage estimates designed to be used with mapping tools and price changes to be input into NiGEM. The tool would be co-designed with HMT to ensure that it meets its needs now and in the future.
> 
> The project will also produce public data and interactive online maps describing (1) the spatial biophysical impacts and their associated economic damages; (2) global country-level GDP loss and associated uncertainty; (3) case study based fiscal risks from NiGEM and other outputs from the NiGEM model.
> Future work could engage a larger community of experts and stakeholders across the NGFS network in workshops and facilitate the tool’s uptake in other countries (O6). We could also incorporate a custom-calibrated AI to translate narrative scenarios into quantitative inputs appropriate for exploration within the tool.
> 
> Task 5.2: Propose and analyse adaptation policies: This task would explore a range of policies, including both hard adaptation (e.g., infrastructure investment) and soft adaptation (e.g., disclosure, stress testing). Using the tool, some of these policies evaluated within a benefit-cost framework, to help the UK government maximise the returns from investments in adaptation policy and to understand where vulnerable groups can be best supported by existing adaptation options and where new adaptation options are needed.
> Future work could develop explicitly optimise across the adaptation options included in the flexible tool under multiple budget constraints, to provide clearer policy advice.
> 
> Grant Outputs and Key Performance Indicators:
> The main output products of this work are:
> ●	A flexible open-source tool to evaluate sectoral impacts and trade spillovers.
> ●	A public data product and interactive visualisation tool of high-resolution UK impacts, global macroeconomic impacts, and case-study fiscal impacts.
> ●	Two briefings for policymakers that synthesise (1) key UK insights and (2) globally-relevant contributions for NGFS and its members.
