**user**:
> I am trying to submit a form in javascript, but I am getting a bad request response. Here's how it looks in html:
>   <form id="input-form" method="POST" style="display: none">
>     <input type="hidden" name="log_filename" value="{{ log_filename }}" />
>   </form>
> And the javascript:
>     var searchForm = document.getElementById('input-form');
>     var formData = new FormData(searchForm);
>     formData.append('input_text', text);
>     const response = await fetch('/completion', {
>         method: 'POST',
>         body: formData
>     });

> This returns code 400. Why?
**assistant**:
> The 400 Bad Request error often indicates that the server couldn't understand the request because of invalid syntax or invalid data. Here are a few things that could be causing the problem:
> 
> 1. **Rendering the hidden input field:** You have utilized a template value in this manner: `value="{{ log_filename }}"`. If you are not using some server-side template engine or JavaScript client-side templating, the `log_filename` value may not be set. Also, if this is a server template, check whether the log_filename has a proper value when the HTML is served from the server.
> 
> 2. **Mismatch in expected payload type and format**: Your server may be expecting a different type or format of data, such as JSON, but here, you're sending form-data. Verify if the endpoint `/completion` is set up to receive form-data or JSON. For JSON, it would look something like this:
> 
>     ```javascript
>     const response = await fetch('/completion', {
>         method: 'POST',
>         headers: {
>             'Content-Type': 'application/json'
>         },
>         body: JSON.stringify({
>             log_filename: /* appropriate value */,
>             input_text: text
>         })
>     });
>     ```
> 
> 3. **Incorrect path or endpoint:** There might be an issue with the path you're sending the request to. '/completion' might be incorrect or may not allow POST requests.
> 
> 4. **Client-side validations:** Check if 'text' variable is not null or undefined since you're appending this in formData. 
> 
> 5. **Async/Await Error Handling:** Look into whether you are handling your async/await correctly. Make sure it's wrapped in a try/catch block in case an error is being thrown:
> 
>     ```javascript
>     try {
>         const response = await fetch('/completion', {
>             method: 'POST',
>             body: formData
>         });
>     } catch(error) {
>         console.error('Error:', error);
>     }
>     ```
> 
> By diagnosing each of these areas, you should be able to locate where the problem is coming from. If everything seems correct, look into the server logs, which might give additional clues about the reason for the Bad Request.
