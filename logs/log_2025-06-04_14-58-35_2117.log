> Is there an elegant way to take a random draw from a linear regression model in R (produced by lm). My normal process is to grab the coefficients and the covariance matrix, and then use those in a multivariate normal distribution to get out one set of parameters, and then apply those parameters to my prediction independent variables.

> This function assumes your `new_data` is a data frame containing the values of your independent variables for prediction. It checks for and correctly handles the inclusion of an intercept if your model includes one. You can adapt the `new_data` part of the function if you need to handle more complex scenarios or different variable transformations.

**user**:
> Can you adjust this so I can get out N random draws, all with the same new_data?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! You can modify the function to accept a parameter `N`, which specifies how many random draws you want to obtain. The function will then return a matrix, where each row corresponds to a prediction from a different random draw of the parameters. Here’s the adjusted function:

> ### Explanation:
> 1. **N Parameter**: The function now accepts an integer `N`, which indicates how many random draws you want.
> 2. **Matrix of Predictions**: The predictions matrix is created by multiplying the `new_data` with the transposed random parameters, with each row corresponding to a separate random draw.
> 3. **Return Value**: The function returns a matrix where each row represents the predictions based on the randomly drawn parameters.
> 
> This modification allows you to efficiently obtain multiple predictions while keeping the same set of independent variable values. Let me know if you have further questions or need any additional modifications!
