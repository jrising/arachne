> How should I select rows from a pandas dataframe based on one of its indexes?
**assistant**:
> When you have a DataFrame with an index, there are several ways to select rows:
> 
> 1. **Selection by label** 
> 
> You can use the `loc` accessor to slice rows by the labels of an index.
> 
> ```python
> df.loc['your label']
> ```
> This returns the row(s) with the index label 'your label'. Please note that it will return a DataFrame if the label is not unique, and a Series if it is.
> 
> 2. **Boolean selection**
> 
> You can also use a boolean condition inside the `loc` accessor.
> 
> ```python
> df.loc[df['column name'] == 'desired value']
> ```
> This returns all rows where the value in 'column name' equals 'desired value'.
> 
> If your index is a DateTimeIndex and you wish to select rows for a certain year:
> 
> ```python
> df.loc[df.index.year == year]
> ```
> 
> Just remember to replace `'your label'`, `'column name'`, `'desired value'`, and `year` with the respective entities in your DataFrame.
> 
> 3. **Selection by Index function**
> 
> You can use `.isin()` function of Index.
> 
> ```python
> df[df.index.isin(['index1', 'index2'])]
> ```
> This will select rows with indexes 'index1' and 'index2'. 
> 
> The selection depends on your specific usage and the type of index (numeric, datetime, etc.). Remember that selection with `loc` is inclusive of both endpoints when using slicing, unlike `iloc`. If you don't know whether an index is in your data frame, using `reindex` is a safe option.
