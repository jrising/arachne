> I want to tell my son about his heritage. My wife's family is Jewish, so I can tell him that he comes from Jews. By my family is from England on my father's side (the Danelaw, with genetic heritage around the North Sea) and northern German on my mother's side. I don't know what to call us. Thinking historically, we are the barbarians (as called by Romans) or Celts or even Vikings. Is there a term for the peoples who were the north-Germanic barbarians and North Sea peoples?

> On your paternal side, it seems your ancestry could best be described as being of "Anglo-Saxon" origin. This term refers to the Germanic tribes that migrated to England from what is now Germany and Denmark, known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.
> 
> Furthermore, your North Sea heritage that connects you to the Vikings could specifically relate you to the "Norse" or "Norsemen", a term for the Scandinavian sea-faring explorers and traders.
> 
> As such, it might be appropriate to identify your family background as a blending of Jewish, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse heritages. While all these labels are complex and multifaceted, each conveys a distinct cultural, historical, and geographic influence that contributes to your family's rich heritage. 
> 
> It's worth noting that "barbarian" was a term used by the Romans to denote anyone who was not Roman and it doesn't necessarily equate to any particular cultural or ethnic identity. Similarly, "Celts" represents a group of tribal societies in Iron Age and Medieval Europe, but its direct connection to your specific heritage might be less clear without more complex genetic or historical analysis.

> Nevertheless, recounting your heritage as Jewish, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse, each with their own trove of tales, traditions, and protagonists, would be quite fascinating.
