**assistant**:
> The duration of sickness from scarlet fever varies with each individual and how quickly it's treated. Typically, the illness begins with a "prodromal phase," which includes symptoms like a sore throat and fever, and lasts for about 24 to 48 hours.
> 
> Once the classic red rash of scarlet fever appears (usually 1 to 2 days after the prodromal symptoms), the disease enters the "acute phase." This can last about a week.
> 
> After the acute symptoms resolve, the "convalescent phase" begins. This is a period of recovery that can last a few weeks and includes peeling of the skin that was covered in the rash.
> 
> Overall, children may be considered "sick" from scarlet fever for 2 to 3 weeks, depending upon the severity of the illness and the response to treatment. However, it's important to note that after 24 hours of antibiotic treatment, a child is usually no longer considered contagious. For best advice, one should always contact a healthcare professional.
