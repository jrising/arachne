**user**:
> I remember a pretty old movie set in ancient Egypt, with an ambitious queen, who in the end gets buried alive when she makes the pharoah die and is trapped in his tomb. What was it?
**assistant**:
> The movie you're referring to sounds like "The Egyptian" from 1954. One of the film's primary characters is Queen Nefretiri, who is ambitious and conniving. However, I should note that this movie doesn't exactly match your description. While there are plenty of films featuring ancient Egypt and ambitious queens, the specifics of an ambitious queen causing the pharaoh's death and getting trapped in his tomb is not a common story.

> To strengthen my search, could you provide more details, such as any names of characters, actors, or specific scenes you recall? That might assist me in identifying your movie.
