> How do we create specific, actionable expectations for the Board to fundraise that they’ll be excited about? How can we map the different ways Board members can engage in fundraising, and then develop a tailored plan for each Board member? (ex. engaging each board member in a 1-1 with a standard set of questions, and we can then synthesize and make our recommendation ahead of or at the retreat for how they'll engage collectively, and as individuals, with our development efforts.)

> Do we want to align this framework with our Dev strategy? 
> Have tried to engage Board in a more group-orientated way ex. Who can look at this list of 5-10 names? Have not gotten a lot of response 
> Board members prefer a tailored approach vs a blanket approach
> Board is not a “working board” so they need expectations ahead of time 
> Questions for Board members
> How do they interact in meaningful ways? Where are they having conversations and where do they want to expand their network. If they are down for intros, where can they make intros
> Set meetings asap so we have time to prep before October
> Send pre-survey, which includes where do you fall from intro - closing, etc 
> May want to ask about limitations/opportunities based on their organization/role in the survey.
> Are they interested in corporate or foundations or both 
> Include meeting times/doodle poll on when we can meet in sept

**assistant**:
> Subject: Exciting Developments & Approach for Our Fundraising Efforts
> 
> Dear Board Members,
> 
> We hope this email finds you well. As we continue to strive for the goals of our organization, we're excitingly exploring ways to create specific, actionable expectations for our fundraising efforts. We believe in tailored plans, rather than blanket approaches, and it is with this belief that we look forward to tapping into your unique capabilities and networks.
> 
> The fundraising model we're considering involves three stages: (1) introductions, (2) cultivation, and (3) closing. These stages draw from proven corporate strategies, and we're looking to align this with our development strategy. We understand that our Board is not a typical "working board", hence each member will have expectations laid out in advance.
> 
> To understand how we can maximize our collective efforts, we plan to engage with you in a 1-1 session. This meeting would be an avenue to map how you might prefer to engage in our fundraising efforts, and to explore your interests and comfort zones. We are keen to understand where you have meaningful conversations, the networks you'd like to expand, and where you can make introductions.
> 
> In preparation for this engagement, we will send a pre-survey for you to fill out at your earliest convenience. It will cover details from your fundraising role preference (whether it's introductions, cultivating relationships, or closing deals), obstacles/opportunities you foresee based on your organization/role, and your interest in working with corporate entities or foundations-- or perhaps both.
> 
> A considerable part of the strategy focuses on membership, and we're thinking of piloting a membership model where Board members can support their peers. We can discuss this further and make it a part of our collective plan during our upcoming retreat.
> 
> We are also contemplating the idea of a fundraising challenge, something enjoyable that also promotes the spirit of giving. The success of such campaigns could mean a more effective use of committees and networks.
> 
> Additionally, we're looking at incorporating a "give/get lite" model into Board member expectations and considering a holiday card drive as a way to further mobilize our efforts.
> 
> Our goal is to have a clear, tailored plan for each Board member by the October retreat, so we encourage you to make time as soon as possible for a meeting or to fill out the pre-survey. We look forward to embarking on this journey together.
> 
> Thank you for your time and continued dedication to our shared cause. 
> 
> Best regards,

**user**:
> why do hand written cards to solicit donations? 
> "
**assistant**:
> Handwritten cards can be a powerful tool to solicit donations for several reasons:
> 
> 1. **Personal Connection**: Handwritten cards convey a personal touch that standard communication methods like emails or printed letters may lack. The effort and time put into writing a personal message by hand can create a stronger emotional connection with the recipient, making them feel valued and appreciated.
> 
> 2. **Higher Open and Response Rates**: Handwritten envelopes tend to stand out in a pile of mail, increasing the likelihood that the recipient will open and read the message inside. This can lead to higher response rates compared to mass-produced communications.
> 
> 3. **Humanizes the Sender**: Handwritten cards humanize the sender, showing that there is a real person behind the message who took the time to reach out personally. This personal touch can resonate with the recipient on a deeper level and foster trust and goodwill.
> 
> 4. **Differentiation**: In a digital age where most communications are electronic, receiving a handwritten card can be a refreshing and unexpected surprise. It sets your message apart from the digital noise and demonstrates a level of care and attention that can make your solicitation more memorable.
> 
> 5. **Enhances Perceived Value**: Handwritten messages are often perceived as more valuable and meaningful than printed communications. This can influence the recipient's perception of your organization and the importance of your cause, potentially leading to increased engagement and donations.
> 
> 6. **Encourages Reciprocity**: The act of receiving a handwritten card can trigger a sense of reciprocity in the recipient, prompting them to reciprocate the effort and kindness shown to them. This reciprocity can manifest in the form of donations or other forms of support for your organization.
> 
> In summary, handwritten cards can be an effective and personalized way to solicit donations by forging a personal connection, increasing engagement, humanizing the sender, differentiating your message, enhancing perceived value, and fostering reciprocity from the recipient. This personal touch can significantly impact the recipient's response and willingness to support your cause.
