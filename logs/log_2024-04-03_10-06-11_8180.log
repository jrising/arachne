> The viking tales talk about doing things like saying who you are as you kill someone and such. Is this a sense of honor, or is there a better term?
**assistant**:
> The behavior you're referring to is often associated with the concept of "Viking honor," though it's much more multifaceted and complex. A more precise term might be "bragÃ­" (pronounced 'brah-yee'), which is an Old Norse term used to describe a blend of honor, courage, boasting, and reputation-conscious behavior.
> 
> In Viking culture, personal and familial reputations were highly significant. Announcing one's name and lineage in battle serves a dual purpose: to instill fear in enemies by stating your heroic lineage, and to ensure your acts of bravery and valor won't go unrecognized. By doing so, if a Viking warrior does fall in battle, their glory would live on in sagas and songs, immortalizing their name and deeds.
> 
> While this might strike us as boastful, in the context of Viking society, it was seen as a key part of their ethos, and a way of creating and perpetuating a personal legacy. This is certainly not the same as our modern concept of honor, but it does reflect distinct cultural values placed on bravery, reputation, and martial prowess in Viking society.
