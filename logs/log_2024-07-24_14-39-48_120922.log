> can you turn this list into a narrative of why EF midwest should fund our work on the following "-IMT sends notification to cities about  of funding opportunities (supported them in sending a letter out that funding is available) 
> -Support on X applications and projects 
> -support the work in getting funding to the cities (coordination and negotiation tools and time) 
> EX. Slipstream got money saying the “will support 5 proposals in the midwest “50k first round, then BuildUS money
> -some budget to get ppl together in person (pitch supporting a gathering/conveening)

> Certainly, here's how the narrative for EF Midwest funding could be structured:
> 
> ---
> 
> The nature and urgency of achieving sustainable urban environments necessitates unique and innovative collaborations. We are seeking funding from EF Midwest to further empower our city-focused climate mitigation and resilience work. Our work revolves around key areas that align neatly with the overarching objectives of EF Midwest.
> 
> One of the prime areas is helping cities tap into funding. Our collaborative partner, the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), is instrumental in notifying cities of looming funding opportunities. As an example of this work's importance, IMT recently facilitated the distribution of a critical letter outlining availability of funding. Fully resourced, we'll be poised to amplify such efforts across the Midwest, acting as a primary conduit between national resources and local action.
> 
> Our determined commitment extends to comprehensive support on climate-impact applications and city-centered sustainability projects, drawing on our deep expertise in implementation, management, and scalability. For instance, our relationship with Slipstream, a nonprofit transforming the market for energy-efficient businesses, led us to support five groundbreaking proposals in the Midwest. Notwithstanding, the initial funding from Slipstream - $50K - was catalytic; it enabled these proposals to secure further financing from prominent green initiatives like BuildUS.
> 
> Moreover, we foresee a positive ripple effect from bringing an in-person gathering to fruition, leveraging a portion of the potential funding to convene local and regional stakeholders. More than a meeting, this convening will serve as an incubator for sustainable urban ideas and a breeding ground for cross-sector partnerships, creating a ripple effect that will echo across the region.
> 
> We have also been proactive in garnering federal support for our regional activities. For instance, procuring the Illinois Commerce and Economic Opportunity Grant (ICGC) for Illinois remains one of our pivotal successes on the federal level. This kind of triumph not only bolsters local climate action, but fosters the type of national-local interplay integral for scalable environmental benefits.
> 
> In aggregate, the backed work represents a strong return on philanthropic investment. The cities we service are at the vanguard of sustainable urban progress, but without proper support in the form of awareness, application assistance, coordination, and negotiation tools, their story - and more critically, their impact - could be compromised. We stand poised to ensure that doesn't happen. With your support, we're confident that we can unlock the full climate-mitigation and sustainability potential of these Midwest cities, driving regional resilience and establishing a firm precedent for others to follow.
