**assistant**:
> The "Making introductions to foundations new to IMT" refers to the process of establishing new connections between the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) and different foundations that haven't interacted yet.
> 
> In introducing IMT to these new foundations, the main goal is to showcase the IMT's initiatives, objectives, successes, and potential synergies with the prospective foundations' missions. The process involves a series of steps:
> 
> 1. **Research:** Uncover the foundation's interests, goals, and current initiatives. Understand their mission and the kinds of projects they usually support.
> 
> 2. **Preparation:** Tailoring a presentation or introduction that aligns IMTâ€™s work with the foundation's goals, mission, or interests. This could involve preparing case studies, data about impacts, specific examples of success, and plans for future initiatives that resonates with the foundation's objectives.
> 
> 3. **Arranging a Meeting:** This involves reaching out to decision-makers or contacts within the foundation to set up a meeting or discussion. The goal is to present IMT and its vision, and to discuss potential areas of collaboration or support.
> 
> 4. **Presentation:** During the meeting, the introduction should focus on what IMT has achieved, what it aims to accomplish, and how the foundation can support or be involved in such efforts.
> 
> 5. **Follow-Up:** After the meeting, timely follow-up should be conducted to address any questions, offer additional information and maintain the line of communication for potential future collaborations.
