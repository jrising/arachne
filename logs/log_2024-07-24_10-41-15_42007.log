> In selectize.js, how do I add a new option in javascript? My selectize input is #sector_select.
**assistant**:
> To add a new option to a Selectize.js input, you can use the `addOption` method. Here's an example of how you can do this for your `#sector_select` input:
> 
> ```javascript
> // First, initialize your Selectize input (if it's not already initialized)
> $('#sector_select').selectize();
> 
> // Get the Selectize instance
> var selectize = $('#sector_select')[0].selectize;
> 
> // Add a new option
> selectize.addOption({ value: 'new_value', text: 'New Option Text' });
> 
> // Optionally, you can also select the new option immediately
> selectize.addItem('new_value');
> ```
> 
> Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
> 
> 1. **Initialization**: Initializes the Selectize input on `#sector_select` if it's not already initialized.
> 2. **Get Instance**: Retrieves the Selectize instance for `#sector_select`.
> 3. **Add Option**: Adds the new option with the specified `value` and `text`.
> 4. **Select Option** (Optional): Selects the newly added option.
> 
> Make sure your new option has a unique value to avoid conflicts with existing options. If you have any specific requirements or run into issues, feel free to ask!
**user**:
> When I try this, it adds an option called "undefined" to the selectize box.
**assistant**:
> If you're seeing an "undefined" option when adding a new option in Selectize.js, it's likely due to the structure of the object you're passing into the `addOption` method. Make sure you are properly defining both the `value` and `text` keys. Here's a corrected example:
> 
> ```javascript
> // Initialize Selectize (if not already done)
> $('#sector_select').selectize();
> 
> // Get the Selectize instance
> var selectize = $('#sector_select')[0].selectize;
> 
> // Add a new option with properly defined keys
> selectize.addOption({ value: 'new_value', text: 'New Option Text' });
> 
> // Optionally, select the new option immediately
> selectize.addItem('new_value');
> ```
> 
> ### Common Issues
> 1. **Missing Keys**: Ensure that both `value` and `text` are correctly spelled.
> 2. **Value Types**: Ensure `value` is a string or a number without any characters that might cause issues.
> 
> ### Debugging Steps
> - **Check for Errors**: Open the console in your web browserâ€™s developer tools and check for any errors.
> - **Log Added Options**: You can log the options before and after adding to see what is happening:
> 
> ```javascript
> console.log(selectize.options);  // Before adding
> selectize.addOption({ value: 'new_value', text: 'New Option Text' });
> console.log(selectize.options);  // After adding
> ```
> 
> If the issue persists, double-check that you're calling `addOption` correctly on a properly initialized Selectize instance. Let me know if you need further help!
