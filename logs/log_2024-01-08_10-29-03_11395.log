> ---
> This report presents headline results on the macroeconomic losses caused by climate change today. The methodology draws on 58 economic models and employs machine learning to develop “best estimates” of the current GDP and capital wealth losses from climate change.
> 
> The research reveals significant disparities in the impacts of climate change across regions and economic groups. The findings emphasize the vulnerability of low-income countries and tropical regions, which are already experiencing substantial GDP losses. Meanwhile, many wealthier nations are seeing smaller impacts or are even benefiting from climate change for the time being.
> 
> Globally, climate change has led to a population-weighted GDP loss of 6.3% in 2022, considering direct, spill-over, and capital losses. The unweighted percentage of global GDP lost is estimated at 1.8%, or about $1.5 trillion, and the difference between those two results reflects the uneven distribution of impacts. 
> 
> Least developed countries are exposed to an average population-weighted GDP loss of 8.3%, and Southeast Asia and Southern Africa are particularly affected, with countries losing an average 14.1% and 11.2% of their GDP, respectively. These losses highlight the disproportionate burden imposed by climate change on developing nations.
> 
> Climate change is also exacerbating existing global inequalities, with many high-income countries currently experiencing net gains, including an average increase of 4.7% to the GDP of European countries.
> 
> With COP28 expected to make progress on the new Loss and Damage Fund to compensate vulnerable countries for natural disasters caused by climate change as decided at COP27, the report also provides impact estimates at the level of relevant UNFCCC negotiating groups (such as G-77, African Group, Aosis, LDCs, and Ailac).
> 
> The analysis also reveals the complex dynamics between climate change, economic outcomes, and capital investments. Low and middle-income countries face significant capital losses, posing challenges to their long-term economic resilience and growth. Low and middle-income countries have experienced $2.1 trillion in produced capital losses due to climate change.
> 
> When GDP and capital losses are combined, low and middle-income countries have experienced a total loss of $21 trillion since 1992 (the Rio Convention). All UNFCCC party groupings except for the EU have experienced total losses, with the greatest losses on the G-77 (which includes high-income countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE) at $29 trillion. These losses are expected to be conservative estimates, since important impact channels and non-market losses are not included in the analysis.
> 
> Climate changes are already depressing economic activity across the globe. These findings underscore the urgent need for global cooperation and support to address the impacts of climate change.

> Title: **Macroeconomic Losses and Capital Erosion from Climate Change: A Global Assessment**
> 
> **Abstract**: 
> 
> This paper presents an empirical analysis of the consequential macroeconomic losses attributed to climate change and the heterogeneity of these impacts across geographical regions and economic groups. With a methodological framework that synergizes 58 economic models and machine learning, we provide a comprehensive estimate of current global GDP and capital wealth losses due to climate change. 
> 
> Our findings reveal a significant disparity in climate change impacts, emphasizing the vulnerability of low-income nations and tropical regions. In 2022, climate change was found to cause a global, population-weighted GDP loss of 6.3%, contrasted by an unweighted loss of 1.8%, or around $1.5 trillion. The divergence in these numbers underscores the uneven distribution of climate change impacts. 
> 
> Substantial GDP losses were observed for least developed countries (8.3% loss), Southeast Asia (14.1% loss), and Southern Africa (11.2% loss), revealing the unequal climate change burdens borne by developing nations. Sinisterly, climate change seems to be fueling global inequalities, with some high-income nations, notably in Europe, witnessing a GDP increase of 4.7%. 
> 
> The research explores the complex interplay between climate change, economic performance, and capital investments, revealing capital losses of $2.1 trillion among low and middle-income countries. Cumulative GDP and capital losses amount to $21 trillion since the 1992 Rio Convention for these nations. The losses are even more pronounced for certain UNFCCC party groups such as the G-77.
> 
> Highlighting the already deleterious impacts of climate change on the global economic landscape, this work underscores the critical need for amplified global cooperation and strategic intervention to tackle climate change.
