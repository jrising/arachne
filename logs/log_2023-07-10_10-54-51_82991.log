> No, the order of variables used in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) does not matter.

> ANOVA is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there are any significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. When performing an ANOVA, what is most important is the assignment of different variables to the correct roles: the independent variables (factors) and the dependent variable (outcome or response).
> 
> The statistical relationship tested by ANOVA is not dependent on the order in which you input the variables. The direction of influence runs from independent variables to the dependent variable. However, in complex multiple factor ANOVAs, the order and interplay of variables can impact interaction terms. This aspect should be considered while interpreting the results. 
> 
> Remember also, statistical significance does not equate to practical significance, so it's vital to interpret the findings in context.
