**user**:
> I have started using Google Tasks. I want to have a tasks on my main list for each project, but then subtasks on other lists. Is it possible to make links between lists?
**assistant**:
> Unfortunately, as of my latest training data up until September 2021, Google Tasks doesn't currently support linking between lists or creating "sublists" or "subtasks" in separate lists. It does have some limited subtask functionality, where you can add tasks underneath an existing task directly, but this might not fulfill your complete requirement. Though Google Workspace often updates its features, I don't have information beyond my last training cut-off.
> 
> Here are alternative approaches you might consider:
> 
> 1. **Use a consistent naming scheme**: Particularly use the project name in the tasks and subtasks, which can make it easier to see at glance which tasks belong to which projects when you are looking in different lists.
> 
> 2. **Use task descriptions**: You could add more information about related tasks or subtasks inside the description of a task. For example, you could list the names of the subtasks from another list or give a brief summary of what those tasks are.
> 
> 3. **Use Labels in Google Keep**: If you use Google Keep, you can create labels for each project and then add those labels to your individual tasks. This way you can easily search and sort by label, providing a sort of "link" between all tasks labeled under a specific project label.
> 
> Be aware, however, to consistently check if there are newer updates on Google Tasks beyond my training cut-off, as new functionalities might have been introduced.
