**user**:

> But I'm having a tough time sticking to that. I want to talk about the structure of the project-- how WP1 will solicit information from stackholders, which will be used for scenarios for WP2-3, for example. But then I have to already talk about the individual objectives for different WPs. And to justify the structure of the project in support of the overall objective (understanding health risks)-- which is how I'm understanding what should go in "rationale"-- I need to already have laid out that objective.
**assistant**:
> It seems like you're running into a common issue in grant writing where the suggested order of presentation doesn't match the logical flow you want for your project. From your description, it seems like discussing the project's structure and the objectives of each work package (WP) is intrinsic to understanding the overall objective of the project and provides the context for why the project is worthwhile.
> 
> Here's an alternate way of structuring your Executive Summary:
> 
> 1. **Background**: Still open with this. Present the problem you're looking to address (contextualize it with pertinent facts and figures for greater impact).
> 
> 2. **Preliminary Objective**: Introduce the general project objective. "Our primary objective is to understand health risks. Specifically, the project will...".
> 
> 3. **Project Structure and Specific Objectives**: This is where you talk about how the project will be carried out, delineating the specific objectives of each WP. "To achieve this objective, our project is structured into three Work Packages (WPs). WP1 will...".
> 
> 4. **Rationale**: After explaining the specifics, revisit and provide a detailed rationale for the project. You can now fully explain why this project structure supports the overall objective. "The structure of this project supports our overarching objective by...".
> 
> 5. **Outcomes**: Finally, conclude with potential project outcomes. A detailed explanation of your methods (project structure and WP objectives) before the rationale enables clearer visualization of the intended outcomes.
> 
> Remember, the objective of the executive summary is to clearly and succinctly explain what your project is about, why it's important, and what is hoped to be achieved. The order of presentation doesn't matter as much as making sure your key points are well-communicated.
