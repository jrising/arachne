> I am fitting an HMM with depmix, where one of the output responses is 0 or 1 value. I'm not sure what family of distribution I should use, but I tried binomial. But I get strange values for the predicted response of that column across states, ranging from -3.664 to (positive) 4.350. How should I interpret or improve this?

> It sounds like you're running into a problem because the binomial distribution, which you're using for your output distribution, maps to values between 0 and 1. Yet, your predicted values are ranging from -3.664 to 4.350.

To get probabilities from the output, one would generally use the logistic function (`plogis` in R) to transform the predicted values.

The choice of family depends on the nature of your data and the scientific question at hand. If 0/1 represents two categories with no "success/failure" implications, considering a categorical (also known as a multinomial with two outcomes) distribution could be an alternative. With a categorical family, the response should be modeled as an integer factor.
