> Page fourteen. Present value cost calculator using the social cost of carbon suggested in the PAD, which varied across projects. In the absence of an identified social cost of carbon, this study assumed sixty dollars per ton of CO2 equivalent for projects approved from two thousand fourteen to two thousand twenty, and seventy-five dollars per ton of CO2 equivalent for projects approved from two thousand twenty-one onward. If the time horizon used in the economic analysis was not disclosed, the authors assumed a standard twenty-five-year horizon with five years of implementation. If otherwise not provided, a standard five percent discount rate was assumed.

> Section two point four, Limitations of the Data. This study faced limitations in its representativeness of adaptation investments. Despite being the most comprehensive database currently available for assessing the benefits and returns of adaptation investments, extrapolating this study's findings is constrained by a relatively small sample size in some sectors, especially of projects that have fully valued benefits in all three dividends. The current sample size is constrained due to: 1) The database selected twelve focus countries and not all developing countries; 2) There is a limited number of adaptation investments per sector and sub-sector available for analysis in each of the focus countries; 3) The triple dividends are not fully identified, and even if identified, are rarely fully valued for inclusion in the rate of return analysis. Of the three hundred twenty projects in AdapTDR, only twenty-seven, or eight point four percent, valued all three dividends.
> 
> This last point is not surprising, as the TDR approach is new. This database shows for the first time that the current state of assessing the full economic benefits of adaptation investments is incomplete. However, it also reveals that adaptation investment Internal Rates of Return, or IRRs, and Benefit-Cost Ratios, or BCRs, albeit extremely high, are still underestimations. Further research is needed to improve the scope and granularity of data available that can be used to evaluate and better demonstrate the economic returns of adaptation investments.
> 
> The accuracy of this study is also limited due to the many types of available studies, as well as the variance in their methodologies and assumptions. Almost all the investments included in this study were analyzed using donor PADs, which are internally reviewed but not subject to academic peer review. There is also a lack of standardization in definitions, methodology, time frames, and discount rates used by donors to conduct cost-benefit analyses. For example, every climate adaptation investment is designed to reduce an identified risk, but climate risks are inherently probabilistic. Cost-benefit analysis of those risks depends on some sort of climate scenario or projected impacts. These scenarios are not standardized across the database, nor could they be. The project appraisals are done in different years and locations, as well as with different underlying assumptions even within the same country.
> 
> The projects in the database are all real and approved for investment. So, stepping back from detailed questions about Return on Investment and Cost-Benefit Analysis, this database is valuable for simply documenting what actual adaptation investments twelve countries have made in recent years. Investment data at this level is available for very few countries, including from Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation Plans. Nevertheless, while this study's data search filters are very likely to have captured virtually all donor-funded projects in these countries, few domestically funded projects were found. It is not known to what extent some of these countries, particularly the bigger ones like Brazil, China, and India, may have invested in adaptation without donor support. Therefore, this database is a positive list of ongoing adaptation investments but does not claim to be exhaustive.
