> # Investing for Resilience
> 
>  - Coastal Resiliency is the ability to anticipate, adapt to, and recover from disruptions, with three core components: society, economy, environment.
>  - Two distinct types of coastal resilience projects exist: hard (built or gray) projects, and soft (natural) projects.
>  - Hard projects include building modifications, drainage systems, sea walls, etc., and are known for their immediate readiness, vast expertise, and understood effectiveness.
>  - The drawbacks of hard projects are that they cannot adapt with climate change, will fail and need maintenance, and may cause environmental degradation. Costs are high, with an estimated installation cost of $6500 to $9800 per meter.
>  - Soft projects focus on maintaining healthy ecosystems such as wetlands, dunes, and mangroves, and are more adaptable to climate change. They also have co-benefits through fishery products and water quality, and are generally more cost-effective.
>  - Soft projects have challenges too; recovery and benefits can take time, best practices vary, and there is less experience and expertise available. These projects may also take up more space.
>  - Hybrid projects combine built and natural components, providing benefits from both systems, but are currently not well understood and face challenges with permitting and cost-benefit analysis.
>  - Moving further inland is another adaptation method for enhancing resilience.
> 
> ## Monitoring for the Future
> 
>  - Understanding the dynamic nature of the coastal economy is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing economic potential, necessitating the creation of a "Coastal Barometer."
>  - The coastal economy faces various risks and opportunities, with infrastructure and assets vulnerable to flooding and sea-level rise, tourism fluctuations, and environmental threats due to climate change. However, these challenges also present opportunities for growth.
>  - A prosperous and healthy economy must also be resilient, capable of mitigating risks, and ready to seize opportunities.
>  - The "Coastal Barometer" will provide a regularly updated dashboard of indices, reflecting the overall health of the coastal economy and its connections to state and national economies.
>  - The Barometer, with readily available data, can support infrastructure development, informed land-use decisions, and accurate forecasting of the effects of new developments.
> 
> ## Research Needs
> 
>  - Future research needs are centered around the development of the "Coastal Barometer," a tool for tracking the health of the coastal economy via an app or website that can provide real-time updates based on economic and ecological indicators.
>  - The impacts of climate change on the coastal economy, including potential losses and disaster preparedness outcomes, are areas requiring further exploration.
>  - The effectiveness, cost-efficiency, and specific benefits of natural and hybrid systems for coastal resilience need to be studied in the context of Delaware.
>  - Assessing the durability of these systems in major storms and the protection value they offer, especially in comparison to built infrastructure, is crucial.
>  - The permitting process for different types of projects and potential barriers, particularly for natural projects, needs to be examined.
>  - Gathering more stories from business owners and residents affected by flooding can enrich the understanding of the impact and implications of coastal resilience measures.
