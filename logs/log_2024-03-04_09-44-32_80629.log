> Below is feedback from a form that other faculty members filled out, to inform a search for an Environmental Justice candidate for our department, the School of Marine Science and Policy. These are all for the same candidate:
> ===
> Please give a SHORT summary of your thoughts here:
> 13 responses
> Easy going and kind.
> I think that they would bring a new and challenging perspective and paradigm to the program in the best possible way
> Warm, welcoming, approachable, knowledgable.
> Nervous, would be good colleague, student friendly, seemed to organize presentation as she went (choosing from 100s of slides), did only so-so on question responses, seemed flexible on courses.
> I think Belinda is a good presenter and interesting person, but lacks the appropriate background in both research and teaching for this CT position.
> Excellent person and academic, not so great fit
> Great teacher and potential future colleague. No marine background. The fit is challenging.
> I thought Belinda had a strong grasp on EJ concepts and would be an excellent candidate. I think they would be able to really further EJ within SMSP and the university to an extent we may struggle to achieve otherwise.
> Positive interaction; background seems variable but very willing to fill the role we need
> Belinda has excellent pedagogical training, but is disciplinarily misaligned with SMSP's needs
> Seems capable but none of her work or expetise intersects with the ocean or coastal environments. Makes no sense for SMSP.
> Not competitive.
> Her EJ lecture lacked a coastal focus, and the teaching approach seemed traditional.
> Longer Candidate Feedback here:
> 12 responses
> I hope she can have more teaching plans for students. I find it might more feasible for her to teach undergraduate courses rather than graduate courses. While undergraduate course the Phd candidates also can contribute a lot. So I mean we need to find her vital advantages in teaching. And today it may not show sufficiently.
> Belinda brings a really important perspective both personally and professionally to the table. I feel like they were thoughtful and engaged across generations - I never got the sense that they were acting differently depending on who they were interacting with (e.g., grad student, undergrad, faculty, etc).
> They had a wonderful presence and were great at the student lunch. They seemed to really care about what we felt and desired as students. I liked their teaching philosophy and passion for the research and work they have done. The seminar was engaging. I had expected them to talk more about EJ issues specifically related to the coast and ocean, although I do understand there were time constraints so this was not necessarily negative, just a note.
> I had a very stimulating conversation with Belinda. Belinda is clearly passionate about EJ, but when I asked some more probing questions about her pedagogy, and research, I found here answers worrying. First, Belinda does not have a very strong publication record. There is one co-authored book chapter in 2015, but nothing since. I feel strongly that a candidate for a faculty position should have more publications than this, even if they are newly graduated. Perhaps Belinda needs a few more years to develop her publishing record, as many graduate students need. Second, when asked about how their work would relate to the marine environment, it was a long awkward silence, they said it was a question that was asked quite a few times. When pressed for any examples, none could be produced. It seems to me that a candidate, knowing they were interviewing at a School of Marine Science and Policy would be able to conjure a few examples, even with a cursory reading of the news, or even a brief review of faculty publications. I tried to prompt with sea-level rise, fisheries, off-shore wind development, coral reef loss. Belinda had heard of sea-level rise problems for small island nations, some whale entanglement issues, and some subsistence fishing in San Diego, but that is all the feedback I received. In short, Belinda did not seem prepared, or interested in marine issues.
> In the presentation, Belinda seemed to indicate that the broad solution to EJ issues was not technical, but social, with particular emphasis on moral realignments. I gave examples of historic technical and engineering solutions to particular climate/population/environmental issues like the development of nitrogen fertilizers, crop hybridization, genetic engineering, ozone hole issues, aqua-culture, water treatment plants and whether they thought that there could be technical solutions (like alternative energy) to our current climate and environmental problems. Belinda seemed more interested in the potential moral effects of these issues. I asked Belinda what kind of moral realignments needed to happen, and they expressed that they were committed (as an activist) to an anti-capitalist, Marxist, oppressor-oppressed frame for understanding justice, who believes that racism is a western value. When asked if activism in the classroom was amenable to good pedagogy for presenting multiple points of view and in the classroom, Belinda said it was compatible. I expressed concern that if a professor openly advocates for moral stances in the classroom, the power-dynamic between students and faculty member would likely result in students who do not share Belindaâ€™s values to be silent, and likely just report what Belinda wanted to hear. In short, I think it is perfectly fine for faculty members to have and advocate for belief systems outside of classroom spaces. But I worry about faculty who view the classroom as primarily and advocacy space, rather than learning space for students of multiple view-points.
> In summary, I think Belinda is an interesting candidate, and we had a lively, fun, and productive discussion. It is my judgement however, that Belinda is not yet ready on the research or pedagogy front for a faculty position in our unit.
> 
> I would love to have Belinda as a colleague. However, during her visit I kept thinking how she was a fit for GSS, not SMSP. BUT she seemed like an excellent teacher and would be a great colleague.
> Enjoyed them as a potential future colleague. I also thought they gave an interactive teaching seminar. I felt heard and seen which were some of principles of environmental justice that they were teaching. I could see them creating a class that could draw many undergraduates (100 ppl) and bring in revenue to SMSP. However, they do not have a background on marine issues and didn't attempt to do some research before their interview on our School. They said they feel they could confidently put together courses on marine topics at an introductory level and would work hard to do so. I also like the diversity they bring to the School.
> Belinda's background speaks for itself, I think. They are an incredibly strong candidate who I think would bring a perspective to SMSP and the university at large that is currently lacking. Belinda clearly has a strong grasp of EJ and is able to apply its principles to varied issues. Food systems are inherently tied to marine science and policy, which Belinda seems to understand. A further benefit here is that Belinda has both theoretical and practical experience and knowledge which I think would resonate with students as they work to understand how EJ might apply to their work and their understanding of the world at large.
> Strong and engaging candidate. I appreciated their background in the food industry, as this could connect well to fisheries and aquaculture work. Lack of coastal background is interesting but seems able to adapt. Teaching style (as discussed during lunch) seemed very positive
> I have no doubts this candidate would be an excellent educator, would engage with students, faculty, and CTAL around groundbreaking pedagogy, but their area of expertise has little to no overlap with the realm of marine environmental justice
> Belinda would be a fish out of water in our marine-focused department. The answer she gave in her seminar about what an environmental justice course would look like in Sussex County addressed only indigenous peoples and food procurement, not any specific coastal issues and certainly nothing marine. Could she pivot and learn the information needed to teach SMSP courses? Belinda did impress me more in person than during the seminar. I pointed out the volumes of the Challenger Expedition in my office as part of a discussion about teaching in-person vs. online and she knew what they were. She also seemed interested when I suggested there could be an intersection between her work and the oyster aquaculture being done in Lewes. But we would have to have our fingers crossed that Belinda would shift her interests to something more relevant to SMSP if she was hired and that's a big gamble. I think she is very dynamic and capable but not a great candidate for this department.
> Dr. Cherie Ramirez seemed very limited in the scope of issues they understood and engaged in. I am concerned that they would not be able to effectively teach in MAST492, which is a course listed in the job description. And any new course development would be more at home in GSS than in SMSP.
> I watched Belinda's seminar online and then met her in Lewes.
> 
> Her teaching seminar talked about EJ in general, but, to me, a huge component of the "coastal area" is missing. I feel that the course plan she developed missed an emphasis on coastal or marine environments. This teaching position may have a different emphasis from what I interpret, but this is concerning as we are in a marine-oriented program. Our focus on coastal study makes our perspective somehow differ from the EJ in general. I think an innovative combination of "coastal" and "EJ" was lacking from her lecture. Besides, the lecture was mostly descriptive and retrospective, lacking data-based quantitative evidence from recent studies.
> 
> Her teaching approach seemed traditional (e.g., instructing based on slides in combination with in-class discussion). I wish she could have integrated the outcome of the students' discussion into her lecture (as the discussion took away quite a bit of lecturing time). However, given the approach she applied, it was hard for the instructor to extract valuable information than reported by the lead student.
> 
> Our one-on-one meeting discussed the workload, student structure, and MAST492 capstone. Belinda has a pleasant personality but did not demonstrate (strong) interest in bringing EJ to coastal environmental research, though there were many places in our conversation for her to steer the topic. She seemed unprepared for meeting with me, and there was no follow-up after her visit.

> Please give a SHORT summary of your thoughts here:
> 15 responses
> I thought Scott was very personable and a well qualified candidate. His research is interesting, valuable, and aligns with others at UD. However I thought his seminar and lecture were dry and not very engaging.
> Clear, kindly, not analytical, organized
> Kind, approachable, knowledgeable, enthusiastic
> I thought Scott gave a great seminar (recording anyway).
> Personal interaction was fine, seemed to have missed opportunities during the seminar..
> He said a lot about nothing.
> Dedicated educator with thoughtful commitment to EJ
> Acceptable lecturer. Work on desalination, but not much else marine.
> Dr. Odell is clearly knowledgable in his field and well qualified. While I think his qualifications speak for themselves, I think there are better candidates for an EJ focused position at this time.
> Not an acceptable candidate.
> Not competitive.
> It seems that not enough is known about the subject of environmental justice
> Great lecture with well-designed student engagement and data-based contemporary topics for coastal and marine research.
> I think Dr. Odellâ€™s presentation was good, but I would have liked more marine examples. Dr. Odell has the strongest CV in both teaching and research, and seems to be the most qualified of the candidates. I think Dr. Odell could handle both graduate and undergraduate courses.
> Scott seems broadly experienced in active pedagogy and knows how to adapt courses to various disciplines/modalities/class sizes
> Longer Candidate Feedback here:
> 13 responses
> Not a command presence in the room. Mostly "listed" issues and discussed. Did not tie the issues to an EJ analysis of any sort. Student demos were to show he could do it, but then didn't really make use of the exercise in any way. I like him. Probably Scott > Belinda for me.
> Lunch with the candidate was great, he took interest in us as students and people alike. He was clearly knowledgeable and had done a lot of interesting work in EJ spaces. He did a good job explaining concepts during his seminar and he seemed to have a lot of teaching experience. In the seminar I would have liked to se some examples of the EJ issues he talked about, such as case studies showing how, say, plastic pollution was an EJ issue. Other than that he did a great job.
> I enjoyed the recording of Scott's presentation. Specifically, I appreciated how he connected the environment to environmental justice. Some of the applications he discussed in coastal habitats compared to the other prospective candidate seemed more fitting with our college.
> We had dinner together after his long day of interviews and seminar. He held a conversation well and was collegial. His seminar started strong but then lost steam towards the second half. He relied heavily on a review paper but when put to task did not have a lot of answers that were likely in the paper. I am not sure if missing the mark was a result of the topic but he would have been better off if he relied on this own research for a presentation like this. I did not get a chance to interact with the other candidates so cannot offer an opinion in that capacity.
> On the surface, Scott seems capable of instructing college courses. However, that was about it - every time I gave him the chance to go deeper into a topic, he avoided it. While mining was supposed to be his area of speciality, he seemed to not be informed on anything in the greater mining arena. I was rather underwhelmed with his interview.
> He's a very enthusiastic educator, with clear dedication to teaching so the teaching track position makes sense for him. He has good background in environmental justice both as theory and in the classroom, and I think he would have some really good insights in how to connect SMSP environmental justice courses with other initiatives on campus that could help drive enrollment. We mainly talked about climate scholars social justice movements on campus and EJ curriculum so I have less of an idea of his coastal and marine interests.
> He went over the EJ history and principles and can teach the topic. He was a bit quiet and hard to hear. He tried to integrate marine issues into his presentation, but did not have much of a background. He expressed interesting in co-teaching a marine policy class, but not solo teaching such a class. He does have interesting research on desalination and the energy transition.
> Dr. Odell was pleasant to interact with and had many interesting stories to share about EJ and his work. I found his presentation to be fairly standard, though interesting enough, in terms of how one might present their research related to EJ. I found myself hoping that he would delve into what EJ meant to him and how he felt his privilege might shape his research and his classroom environment more than he did. While he mentioned the importance of diversity and inclusion, he didn't make note of how he might achieve that, which I found a little disheartening given the EJ issues often disproportionately affect BIPOCs, women, and other disadvantaged groups. While I respect Dr. Odell's qualifications and enjoyed interacting and hearing from him, I did feel that he might be better suited to a more general faculty position rather than the EJ position specifically.
> I had initial hope from Scott's work in coastal communities and desalinization but the presentation of ways that humans intersect with the oceans shows that he really does not know enough background information about what he was trying to teach. I thought some of his presentation was misleading. Returning the brine to the ocean that you removed in a desalinization plant is not like adding equivalents of the Great Salt Lake, it's closer to natural evaporation. My interactions with him in person were also disappointing. I could not get him to substantively answer any question that wasn't about his area of expertise. He defaults to 'what do you think' or 'I would love to learn that from you'. There's no curiosity or willingness to engage in conversation. Please don't advance this candidate, I would hate to be on the undergraduate curriculum committee or really any committee with him.
> I appreciated that the teaching talk had a formal academic structure (rooted in theory), and used some interactive approaches. I was glad to see some marine examples, but they were superficial. I was underwhelmed in subsequent one-on-one meeting when we discussed ideas for 492, and perhaps a 300-level "marine policy" course. I was also struck when he wasn't aware of some recent news in deep-sea mining (covered in major national/international news outlets).
> I watched Scott's seminar online and met him in Lewes.
> 
> I was impressed with Scott's lecture, as it was marine-related, thought-provoking, and well-organized. He used the online platform for in-class surveys and discussions; though I am not a big fan of technology, I found the approach more effective in getting students engaged and monitoring students' discussions. I like that he synthesized several contemporary topics and related research in his teaching, making it more connected to real-world applications. 
> Interestingly, his teaching approach and the scope of his perspective align with our MAST492 Capstone course (please check with Dr. Kimberly Oremus whether she felt the same), which gave me high confidence that he can seamlessly transition his teaching experience to our SMSP program.
> 
> When meeting with him on the second day, we continued to discuss his teaching, including but not limited to the textbook he selected and the knowledge and skillsets he would like to instruct.  We also discussed many coastal EJ topics (e.g., ocean plastics and resources in the Arctic) that could incorporate the expertise of SMSP colleges. Scott must have researched the faculty background, as he could resonate with familiar research topics during our conversation and navigate into further teaching ideas. He also sent me a follow-up email about his enthusiasm for teaching in our program and a summary of our discussion during the one-on-one meeting.
> 
> Overall, Scott is a great instructor for the TT position, focusing on EJ in the coastal environment. He is also very open-minded and easy-going, making him a great colleague to work with.
> I had a very good conversation with Dr. Odell, and found him to be the most open minded of the candidates. This is probably because (as his CV indicates) he has the most experience in teaching and research in the EJ space. I particularly like that he has raised substantial funds in the EJ space, which is a testament to his dedication to the field, and his flexibility as a scholar. Even though this is a CT position, it demonstrates that our students will get an expert that also does research. Dr. Odell indicated that teaching is his passion, so I have no doubt that the CT position is right for him. To me, Dr. Odell seems to be the most financially useful to the department, since they can teach a large EJ course, as well as maintain funding.
> While teaching focused, Scott is still involved in research and brings that into the classroom. Scott clearly has familiarity with some of the advances in pedagogical literature in the last decades and takes an active approach to classroom time. It sounded like his students are able to develop transferrable skills in his courses beyond just mastering course concepts, which is certainly a plus. Topically, I'm not sure Scott's EJ expertise/focus is aligned with a marine EJ position.

> Please give a SHORT summary of your thoughts here:

> professional and ambitious, clear plan
> Dr. Hess's seminar was insightful, digestible, and well-organized.
> Sophie is knowledgeable, approachable, interested, and engaged. I liked hearing about her research background especially.
> Easy to talk to, knowledgeable, takes interest in students, nice integrated/interdisciplinary teaching approach
> Nice lecture on how early colonialism shaped water policies with indigenous communities today.
> Interesting candidate. Still unsure of fit, ability to teach to our curriculum

> While willing to learn, Sophie has minimal pedagogical training
> Not ready, not confident that she could teach anything other than the historical aspects of environmental problems
> Unacceptable or abstain. Lean unacceptable.
> Brings a novel perspective, but not enough depth.
> I thought Sophie would be a good classroom lecturer based on her seminar and she was easy to interact with over a meal.
> Longer Candidate Feedback here:
> 13 responses
> She has got the plan to teach and she knows about her advantages. She is ambitious in teaching even in academics develpoment. While she might not be good at teaching research methods course, I also think her might be more suitable than last week's two Doctors.
> Dr. Hess would be a valuable addition to UD because she addresses topics and theories which diversify the scholarship within the University. Methods of decolonial, queer, and inclusive thinking are fundamental to improving our understanding of histories.
> Sophie has a strong interdisciplinary background and has a firm understanding of theoretical and practical applications of environmental justice. I loved her explanation of how history is important to the present and think that her perspective is so needed in the SMSP school right now. In terms of teaching philosophy and pedagogy, I appreciated her project-based learning model as well. Strongest candidate so far!
> She was great at the student lunch, very kind and showed genuine interest in our research and what we would like to get out of a professor in this position. She was also very approachable and clearly knowledgeable about EJ topics. I really liked her approach to teaching by integrating historical methods with modern issues of policy and EJ. My only negative was that her reading from notes during the seminar was sometimes distracting, and for this reason it took me a little while to be fully engaged in the material she was presenting.
> Effective lecturer, especially given where Sophie is in her career (finishing her PhD). I want to note that it is common in the discipline of history to use fewer slides and read from paper notes. (History talks at conferences and seminars can have no slides and just paper notes). The lecture connected well to SMSP's and students' interests in the mid-Atlantic. I like how thoughtful Sophie's answers were to my questions around shaping various courses, including marine policy. Her discipline is the furthest from what most SMSP faculty are exposed to and perhaps students are accustomed to.
> Sophie has an interesting approach to understanding EJ topics through a historical lens. I liked her approach and her methodology of teaching. I am a little worried about her "youth" in academia, but I can see her approach being valuable and more widely applicable. I still maintain reservations about the fit of any of these candidates for SMSP.
> Dr. Hess's demeanor and teaching style were pleasant. She was easy to engage with and I appreciated her candor regarding EJ and her own positionality. She has clearly devoted a lot of time to identifying what EJ means to her and her work and seems deeply committed to meeting students where they are so they can meaningfully engage with the topic at hand. Dr. Hess seems like a strong candidate who I would be glad to learn from and who I think could bring EJ into the department with little issue, helping the department and university advance in EJ discussions at large.
> I had a very good conversation with Sophie, and I found her to be a very interesting young scholar. However, Sophie seemed to be to not be ready to take on the role of a CT position teacher in SMSP. Sophie is still a student, and has not yet developed a resume that I would consider qualifying for this position. Publications (even for a graduate student) are sparse, and there is little indication yet that Sophie plans to develop any sort of funded research program (even educational or humanities research). I realize this is a CT position, but our other CT faculty clearly have more experience in this. More worrying, it is not clear that Sophie has the appropriate background knowledge to teach many of our courses in SMSP. I think she could develop an EJ course, but it seems like this CT position should be able to do more than that. Sophieâ€™s teaching topics are just incongruent with the curriculum and mission of SMSP. I think Sophie has a lot of potential, but still needs to develop before she is considered for a position like this.
> In our conversations, it was clear Sophie plants to continue her scholarship with teaching as a supplement to that work. For a CT position, it's important to have teaching-focused faculty. She was also quite inexperienced in teaching and will need time to hone those skills. She did not engage in any real active learning activities in demo lecture. I'm also not sure a historian is the correct fit for a marine environmental justice teaching position.
> Sophie fits the job ad but she seems both not quite ready for a faculty position yet and also not very versatile in the topics she could teach. I think she would be great for the history department with a secondary appointment in SMSP. My conversation with her didn't give me confidence that she could engage with the quantitative aspects of science or economics, even in a shallow way. This makes me wonder if she could teach scientific writing in our undergraduate writing course, for example. I also got a lot of word salad responses when I asked about environmental justice away from land, e.g., in the context of competition for marine resources. Like Sophie, I think she is capable and nominally able to teach the courses listed in the job ad but I think she would also struggle to relate to the other faculty in SMSP and I am not confident that she could adapt to teach courses outside of her wheelhouse.
> I am not certain this candidate fits well with our department. I did not get a sense that she was well-acquainted with marine science or policy issues, generally speaking. The historical example used to present their lecture on Environmental Justice was interesting, but I get was hoping they would link this to contemporary issues.
> They are very personable and presented their work in a very professional manner. I think they would work well with students and am certain they could learn course materials sufficiently to teach them to students. I feel that they would be good colleagues. However, I have concerns about this candidate teaching some of the courses they would be expected to teach (e.g., the human coupling course, the "writing course") due to their lack of familiarity with marine science issues. I did get a sense that they could teach a course in Environmental Justice and perhaps a more history-based course. But I could not tell that they would contribute additively to the number of students taught by SMSP.
> After the first two candidates, I found Dr. Hess a welcome change. She gave an engaging presentation that left the classroom (on both campuses, as I understand it) with a feeling that her historical perspective was one that could work with our students. In one-on-one conversation, it was clear she would need considerable support to teach marine science topics (even from a social science perspective). While she might grow into the job, this is a CT position that requires someone to teach now, and help us grow the academic program. I am not convinced she could do it.
> I'm not sure how much background Sophie has in marine science (there was little in her talk and even less on her CV). She would be great fit for a history or anthropology department, or maybe even an environmental science department, but I'm not so sure about a marine science/policy program. I'm sure she could re-focus her research and expertise to marine issues, but that would take a while.

> Nathan is at the cutting edge of active pedagogy. He has extensive experience and training in teaching and learning and is clearly devoted to continuing engagement with pedagogical advances. His student-centered approach to teaching is refreshing and unique from the other candidates. In the seminar and in our one on one discussion it was clear that he sees his role as a cultivator of student learning and growth. He would be a huge benefit to our students and a valuable faculty member. His extensive knowledge of coastal environmental justice issues also aligns well with a position focused on marine EJ. In terms of preparedness for the on campus visit, he stood out in his inclusion of, and references to, Delaware-specific content. I would welcome the opportunity to co-teach with Nathan in future.
> At the lunch with students, Nathan was engaged in discussing various aspects of our research and his own research. He seemed to be interested in getting to know everyone and cared about our answers and what we wanted to get out of an environmental justice faculty member. He also had a lot of ideas about how the position could extend beyond the classroom to engage other faculty members, students, and departments across the university. He clearly showed his passion for teaching, mentoring, as well as his expertise in environmental justice and issues related to the coast.
> The seminar that Nathan gave was informative on the topic of environmental justice as well as his research and his approach to teaching and mentoring students at the university level. The seminar was well organized and delivered with confidence. It introduced very relevant and important issues related to environmental justice, while also providing an activity to apply concepts from the lecture. He also presented an excellent overview of potential courses that I think add a lot to the SMSP catalog and would be a benefit to both undergraduate and graduate students.
> I think that Nathan would be an excellent addition to the SMSP faculty. His research is interesting, relevant to current coastal issues, important to addressing environmental injustice within the US. I also think that his personality would fit in well with the other SMSP faculty and he would be an amazing resource to have for students and faculty members from throughout the university. Nathan has an interdisciplinary background that would provide a lot of insight and knowledge to the university and SMSP.
> I think you have 2 tiers. Nate & Sophie are top tier. Scott & Belinda are second tier. Nate and Sophie are better in terms of pure scholarship and fit smsp better. Both would be good colleagues. I think they are better teachers and in the interviews outshined the second tier -- maturity, engagement, curiosity, etc. They also did better answering Qs and had more of a marine slant. Between Nate and Sophie, I pick Nate. He is more policy oriented. He could absolutely teach the MP undergraduate course that is being discussed. (Sophie yes, but it does seem a natural to me.) And then maybe an EJ course. I loved his enthusiasm. I think students would latch on to him quickly. His response to questions tended to be longish, but they were substantive. Hire Nate with Sophie as a very solid backup. Good luck and thanks for you work on this.
> Overall, the candidate seemed to have the most interdisciplinary knowledge (environmental justice, marine policy, and a bit of natural science). The candidate also seemed very eager to improve experiential learning for students both inside and outside the classroom. I liked the idea of bringing students to different communities or bringing those communities into the classroom and hearing different perspectives. However, his lecture had a lot of content and felt at times a bit scattered. Some of the classroom exchanges felt more unidirectional than bidirectional. (I checked other in my interaction because I had watch the recording of the seminar instead of being physically present. I was physically present for all the other seminars, so this could impact my evaluation of this candidate. )
> Nathan was the only candidate who showed a working knowledge of science alongside policy. He's got great experience to bring to us and lots of ideas for integration. Also - I'd be excited to have a male CT faculty, as CT faculty at UD are something like 80% female. I think he has things to offer collaborators here as well as entities such as the Climate Hub. I can see him being very effective at undergrad teaching in our curriculum. I really like his teaching seminar, as he took a different perspective but still got many of the same ideas across as others did. (I also liked Sophie, but I just don't think she has enough science knowledge - Nathan edges her out)
> Lunch was fantastic, Nathan showed interest in us as students and was easy to talk to. I liked the structure of his lecture and his choice to use policy reflection as a way to get "students" participating in class.
> This is the only candidate that I would be excited about having join SMSP. He fits the job ad and he has shown over his career that can pivot and adapt. His career trajectory has taken him to interdisciplinary institutes that merge natural and social sciences. I specifically asked him about this and he described intentionally working with science co-instructors to develop and grade assignments that merged both fields. He also described doing the logistical work (booking rooms, arranging coffee/tea) to create events where undergraduate students and faculty from both natural and social sciences would interact in a structured way that facilitated interaction. He seems very comfortable interacting with science folks; that seems part of his daily life at his current institution. He also showed that he can teach policy in his talk and that's something we arguably don't do enough of in our classes. I see Nathan as the only candidate that could make SMSP better than it is.
> Nathan is sharp. He has experience merging the policy and science communities. His list of potential courses seems to match well with our student base. His mock lecture included a very nice local example of a policy for students to consider. I appreciated all of his responses to questions and feel he can handle the policy side of the Coupling class as well as the Environmental Justice course. I assume he will handle the policy courses well too. I understand this hire will handle the "writing course"; I have concerns about whether an anthropologist is the best person to teach our natural science students technical writing due to differences in how the disciplines write. For example, they generate fundamentally different kinds of datasets, likely have different formats and styles, and require different knowledge-bases.
> I felt all candidates were somewhat lacking, but Dr. Jessee seemed the best among them. I found his teaching demo to be the clearest -- it directly mentioned Delaware, which was a good start. In my one-on-one discussion with him, he came across as having a realistic sense of the position and what was expected of him. While he probably could teach in some of the courses we need filled, I am hesitant that heâ€™ll be able to develop courses in marine science that will differentiate themselves from other CEOE units.
> I think Dr. Jessee would be able to handle teaching an undergraduate course in our unit.
> 
> I had a very good conversation with Dr. Jessee, and found him to be the most open minded of the candidates. This is probably because he has the most experience in the field. I liked that he had actual field experience with a Native American Tribe in a coastal zone, which is something the other candidates lacked. Of the four candidates, Dr. Jessee had the most relevant teaching experience. I still contend that our other CT faculty have CVâ€™s that are far more impressive than these candidates.
> Overall, Iâ€™m confused by the candidate choices. When hearing of the position, I imagined someone working in EJ would be critically (and quantitatively) evaluating environmental policies and practices to determine how they were environmentally unjust, and bring evidence on how policies might be changed to achieve justice. Instead, what I observed was a lot of obscure jargon, untestable ideas, and no real analysis of any kind. I would have taken any attempt at quantification! Donâ€™t get me wrong, they all seemed like nice, interesting people, but I just donâ€™t see how they fit into SMSP.
> Of all the candidates, Nathan is the only one who appears to have a background in aquatic/marine justice issues, and some knowledge of the science associated with those issues. I appreciate that he tailored his talk to Delaware, and demonstrated knowledge of recent policy change in Delaware.
> I thought Nathan did a good job of engaging with us and I enjoyed his presentation. I think he would be a great addition to the program and the university at large and would really be able to engage with the student population at UD and help them learn about EJ.
