> Dear [Bank's Name],
> 
> I reach out to you on behalf of the Institute for Market Transformation ([IMT](https://www.imt.org/)), an organization responsible for driving demand towards energy-efficient buildings. We are poised to set up educational hubs across various cities to promote understanding of Building Performance Standards (BPS) and are looking for esteemed institutions like yours to partner us in this mission.
> 
> **Why Building Performance Standards?**
> 
> Building Performance Standards are crucial in the context of energy savings, cost reductions, and reducing environmental impact. They provide clear performance targets that help identify the most cost-effective energy improvements. This translates into a more sustainable world, substantial savings for building owners, and resilience against energy price volatility.
> 
> **About the Project**
> 
> Our project aims at establishing city-wise hubs that will serve as information and training centers about BPS. This approach will maximize the benefits to property owners, tenants, the community, and, significantly, the broader financial industry by mitigating risks associated with outdated and energy-inefficient properties.
> 
> **What will the hubs do?**
> 
> 1. Provide comprehensive educational resources and programming on BPS.
> 2. Offer training and technical support for implementation.
> 3. Conduct forums inviting and fostering dialogue among varied stakeholders: builders, regional authorities, policymakers, utilities, and the financial sector.
> 4. Develop case studies highlighting the economic and environmental benefits of BPS-compliant buildings.
> 
> **Why Partner with IMT?**
> 
> Our work at IMT has already contributed considerably towards energy efficiency strategies in the real estate sector. Partnerships with organizations like [Bank's Name] will accelerate these efforts, create attractive investment opportunities, and position [Bank's Name] at the forefront of sustainable lending practices. 
> 
> **Bank's Role**
> 
> As a funder and partner, your bank could provide:
> 
> 1. Financing Assistance: We are looking for direct funding to establish and maintain these hubs across various cities.
> 2. Educational Support: Your bank's expertise could contribute to the programming, particularly in offering financial guidance pertaining to BPS compliant buildings.
> 
> **Next Steps**
> 
> We'd love to schedule a meeting to discuss this potential partnership and how it aligns with [Bank's Name]â€™s corporate responsibility and sustainability goals. Please let us know a convenient time for you. 
> 
> Thank you for considering our proposal. We believe that a partnership with [Bank's Name] can significantly advance the adoption of BPS and make our cities more sustainable and energy-efficient.
