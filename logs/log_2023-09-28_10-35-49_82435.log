**user**:
> In the Solow growth model, does gross domestic product correspond to the total production or does it correspond to total consumption?
**assistant**:
> In the Solow growth model, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) corresponds to total production. In this model, GDP is determined by the production function F(K, AL), where K is the capital stock, A is the level of technology, and L is the labor force.
> 
> Total production in the economy, represented by the GDP, is divided into consumption and investment. Consumption (C) is what people use for their immediate needs and wants, while investment (I) is what's set aside to add to the capital stock and enable future production.
> 
> Therefore, GDP can be represented as: 
> 
>     GDP = C + I
> 
> This indicates that gross domestic product in the Solow model equals the sum of consumption and investment.
