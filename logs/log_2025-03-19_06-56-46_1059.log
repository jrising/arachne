> Development agencies still consider climate change benefits as "co-benefits" compared to core development benefits. Therefore, if the developmental or social and environmental benefits—dividends 2 and 3—more than justify a project, there is no reason to quantify the co-benefits. Using the co-benefits methodology, a Multilateral Development Bank can "take credit" for financing adaptation without having to actually value avoided losses.

> Figure 19: Share of total quantified dividends by sub-sector. This finding confirms that the risk reduction contributions of these projects are not well understood and will not be better understood without a more careful assessment of the full scope of the triple dividends. The challenge of finding suitable metrics for building climate resilience remains even after several years of effort. Improved assessments of avoided losses, also known as dividend 1, in the triple dividend approach, can become a useful data source for pricing both risk and risk reduction.

> Section 4.3: Scope for Private Investment in Adaptation. The maturity of a recipient country's development status and finance and its sovereign credit rating plays a role in determining the type of adaptation finance instrument extended to it by Multilateral Development Banks, as shown in Figure 20. The AdapTDR database reflects a diversity of financing modalities, including loans, credits, grants, preferred debts, short-term maturity loans, or a combination of two or more instruments. For instance, China is the highest-rated country in this study, with a Moody's rating of A1. Over 92 percent of China's projects were loans. Ethiopia, by contrast, has the lowest Moody's credit rating among countries included in this study and received only one loan among its thirty-one projects—a mere three percent.
