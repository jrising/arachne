**user**:
> When did houses in the US switch from using wood fire to central heating or water heaters?
**assistant**:
> The transition from wood fire to central heating or water heaters in houses in the United States occurred gradually over time. The specific timeline varied depending on factors such as regional availability of fuel sources, technological advancements, and individual preferences. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the transition.
> 
> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the use of wood-burning stoves for heating and cooking was common in many American households. These stoves were typically located in a central area of the home, such as the kitchen.
> 
> The shift towards central heating systems began in the late 19th century with the introduction of coal-fired furnaces. These furnaces used coal as a fuel source and distributed heat throughout the house via ducts or radiators. The widespread adoption of central heating systems took place throughout the early to mid-20th century.
> 
> During the mid-20th century, there was a gradual transition from coal to other energy sources, such as oil, natural gas, and electricity. Oil and gas furnaces became popular choices for central heating due to their convenience and efficiency. In more recent decades, electric heating systems, including electric furnaces and heat pumps, have gained popularity in many regions.
> 
> As for water heaters, the transition from wood-fired systems to modern water heaters occurred in a similar timeframe. The use of wood or coal-fired water heaters for bathing and household chores started to decrease as the availability and affordability of gas and electric water heaters increased. These gas and electric water heaters have become the predominant choices for residential hot water supply.
> 
> It's important to note that the transition from wood fire to central heating or water heaters was not uniform across the entire country, and rural areas may have continued to rely on wood-burning systems for a longer period due to availability or cost considerations. Additionally, there are still some households today that use wood stoves as a supplemental or primary heat source, though their numbers are smaller.
