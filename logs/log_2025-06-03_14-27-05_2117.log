**assistant**:
> The `ConnectionError: Connection is closed` message suggests that the connection to the browser was lost, likely because of how resources are managed in your loop. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:
> 
> 1. **Ensure Proper Resource Management**: Make sure each page you open is properly closed after use, and if possible, close the page at the end of each iteration. This will help manage memory and could prevent the connection from closing unexpectedly.
> 
>    ```python
>    page = await browser.newPage()
>    try:
>        # Your page interactions here
>    finally:
>        await page.close()  # Ensure you close the page after you're done
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**: Use try-except blocks around the part where the page is created and interacted with, so you can handle any exceptions and close the page appropriately.
> 
> 3. **Check Browser Version**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Chromium with Pyppeteer. Sometimes, mismatches can cause unexpected behavior.
> 
> 4. **Adjust Pyppeteer Launch Options**: Add a `--no-sandbox` flag if you haven't already, as it can sometimes prevent crashes when pages require additional privileges.
> 
>    ```python
>    browser = await pyppeteer.launch(headless=True, args=['--no-sandbox'])
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Consider Browser Timeout Settings**: Lengthen the timeout settings for each page to account for slower connections or resource-intensive operations.
> 
> 6. **Close the Browser If Needed**: If the above steps don't solve the issue, consider managing the lifecycle of your browser instance more tightly. For example, if the loop is running for a prolonged period, you might close the browser and reopen it every few iterations to refresh the connection.
> 
>    ```python
>    if iteration_count % 10 == 0:  # Refresh the browser every 10 iterations
>        await browser.close()
>        browser = await pyppeteer.launch(headless=True, args=['--no-sandbox'])
>    ```
> 
> 7. **Ensure Asynchronous Execution**: Make sure that the entire flow of your method is properly asynchronous, without blocking calls that might inadvertently close the connection.
> 
> Apply these suggestions to your code, and see if the connection stabilizes. Let me know if you need further assistance!
**user**:
> What do you mean by blocking calls that could close the connection? If I call `result = await myfunction(...)` and then within that function call some synchronous functions, is that a problem?
**assistant**:
> Yes, exactly! In an asynchronous context, if you call asynchronous functions using the `await` keyword, that's perfectly fine. However, if within those asynchronous functions you make blocking calls (like synchronous I/O operations, CPU-bound tasks, or long-running computations), it can cause issues.
> 
> ### Here’s Why Blocking Calls Are a Problem:
> 
> 1. **Event Loop Stalling**: In Python’s async framework (like `asyncio`), the event loop is what manages the execution of asynchronous tasks. If a blocking call is made, it prevents the event loop from running other tasks, including maintaining the connection to the browser.
> 
> 2. **Handling Timeouts**: If certain tasks take too long, it can lead to timeouts. For example, if you're waiting for a response from the browser and the event loop is stalled, the connection might be seen as closed.
> 
> ### Best Practices:
> 
> - **Avoid Blocking Calls**: Make sure that any heavy computations, I/O operations or long-running tasks run in a non-blocking way. You can use libraries like `threading` or `concurrent.futures` for CPU-bound tasks, or simply ensure that all I/O is done asynchronously.
> 
>   ```python
>   import asyncio
> 
>   async def my_async_function():
>       # Simulating an I/O operation
>       await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Non-blocking
> 
>       # If you must run a blocking function
>       result = await loop.run_in_executor(None, my_blocking_function)
>       return result
> 
>   def my_blocking_function():
>       # Some CPU-bound work or synchronous I/O
>       # Avoid calling this directly in an async context
>       return "Blocking result"
>   ```
> 
> - **Use `asyncio` Tools**: Take advantage of the `asyncio` library to handle tasks concurrently using `asyncio.gather` or `asyncio.create_task` for launching multiple asynchronous operations without blocking.
> 
> ### Final Recommendation:
> 
> When calling your asynchronous functions, ensure that any blocked code is managed properly. If you find parts of your code that are inherently synchronous and time-consuming, refactor them to run in a way that won't stall the event loop, ensuring the browser connection remains active.
> 
> If you provide specific examples of synchronous functions you’re using, I can help recommend specific solutions!
**user**:
> I do have a function that takes a while to run. Can I just declare it as async and be done?
**assistant**:
> Declaring a function as `async` won't automatically make it non-blocking. For a function that takes a while to run—especially if it's CPU-bound—merely marking it as `async` won't make it run concurrently with other tasks. It will still block the event loop, which can lead to issues like the connection being closed.
> 
> ### When to Declare a Function as `async`
> 
> - **I/O-Bound Operations**: If your function performs I/O operations (like reading files, making network requests, etc.), you want to use asynchronous libraries (e.g., `aiohttp` for HTTP requests) within an `async` function to avoid blocking.
>   
> - **CPU-Bound Operations**: If your function is CPU-intensive (calculations, data processing, etc.), you'll need to run it in a way that doesn't block the event loop.
> 
> ### Making a Long-Running Function Non-Blocking
> 
> If you're dealing with CPU-bound tasks, you can use `asyncio` with `run_in_executor`, which allows you to run blocking code in a separate thread or process. Here's how you can modify your function:
> 
> ```python
> import asyncio
> 
> # Your long-running synchronous function
> def long_running_function():
>     # Simulate a time-consuming task
>     import time
>     time.sleep(5)  # Replace this with actual work
>     return "Result from long-running task"
> 
> # Wrap it in an async function
> async def run_long_running_task():
>     loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
>     result = await loop.run_in_executor(None, long_running_function)
>     return result
> 
> async def main():
>     # Call your async function that runs the long-running task
>     result = await run_long_running_task()
>     print(result)
> 
> # Start the event loop
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     asyncio.run(main())
> ```
> 
> ### Key Points:
> 
> - **Use `run_in_executor`**: This method runs the blocking function in a separate thread (or process, depending on your configuration), allowing the event loop to continue executing other tasks.
> 
> - **Keep I/O Operations Asynchronous**: Always prefer using async libraries for I/O operations to prevent blocking the event loop.
> 
> - **Test Your Code**: Make sure to test the refactored function within your application to ensure that it works as expected without stalling the connection to the browser.
> 
> By managing how you handle long-running tasks, you can keep your applications responsive and prevent issues like the `ConnectionError` you're experiencing. If you have more specific details about the long-running function, I can provide tailored advice!
**user**:
> Actually, I realize that I have a bunch of different calls within my code, each of which can take a few seconds to complete. Can I wrap the whole logic in a big loop.run_in_executor, even though within that I have calls to the page object?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use `loop.run_in_executor` to wrap your whole logic in a separate thread to avoid blocking the event loop. However, there are some important considerations when you do this, especially since you're interacting with the Pyppeteer `page` object, which is designed to be used from the main async context.
> 
> ### Key Considerations:
> 
> 1. **Thread-Safety**: The Pyppeteer library and its objects are not thread-safe. This means that you cannot directly call methods on the `page` object from within the executor while it's running in a separate thread. You’ll need to keep all interactions with the `page` object in the async context.
> 
> 2. **Separation of Logic**: Instead of wrapping the entire logic that involves the `page` object in `run_in_executor`, consider isolating only the CPU-bound or long-running synchronous operations within it. This way, your interactions with the `page` remain within the async context, preventing any potential racing or blocking issues.
> 
> ### Recommended Approach:
> 
> ```python
> import asyncio
> from pyppeteer import launch
> 
> # Your long-running synchronous function
> def long_running_function(data):
>     # Simulate CPU-bound work
>     import time
>     time.sleep(5)  # Replace this with actual work
>     return f"Processed: {data}"
> 
> async def process_page(page, data):
>     # This is where you interact with the page object, which must remain async
>     await page.goto('https://example.com')
>     # Add your additional page interactions here
>     print(f"Interacting with page for: {data}")
> 
> async def run_task_with_page(browser, data):
>     page = await browser.newPage()
>     try:
>         # Process the page after your CPU-bound logic
>         result = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, long_running_function, data)
>         await process_page(page, result)
>     finally:
>         await page.close()  # Ensure you close the page after the task is done
> 
> async def main():
>     browser = await launch(headless=True)
>     
>     # Example data to process (could be a list of DOIs, etc.)
>     data_to_process = ['data1', 'data2', 'data3']
> 
>     # Launch tasks concurrently
>     tasks = [run_task_with_page(browser, data) for data in data_to_process]
>     await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
> 
>     await browser.close()
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     asyncio.run(main())
> ```
> 
> ### In This Approach:
> 
> - **Long-Running Logic Is Isolated**: The CPU-bound computation is performed in the executor, but interactions with the `page` object (like `page.goto`, etc.) are done within the async function `process_page`.
> 
> - **Control Flow**: The `main` function gathers tasks without blocking and allows each task to handle its page interaction while isolating the blocking parts.
> 
> - **Async/Await Pattern Maintained**: By keeping the interactions with the `page` object within the async context, you leverage the event loop effectively.
> 
> This structure will help prevent blocking issues and ensure that your page operations remain responsive while handling any long-running tasks appropriately. If you need further clarification or adjustments based on your specific case, feel free to ask!

> This happens when I'm trying to call `await browser.close()` after an error. How can I make sure that this error passes silently?
**assistant**:
> The error you're experiencing seems to occur because the event loop gets closed before the `browser.close()` coroutine gets a chance to run. This can happen when an exception occurs, leading to the abrupt termination of your main coroutine, which in turn closes the event loop.
> 
> To handle this situation gracefully and ensure that the browser closes properly even in the case of errors, you can use a try-except block or wrap your main logic in a method that safely handles exceptions. Here's how to do that:
> 
> ### Safe Handling of the Event Loop
> 
> 1. **Use try-except to Handle Errors**: Surround your main logic in a try-except block to catch any exceptions and ensure that `browser.close()` is called.
> 
> 2. **Use a finally Block**: This ensures that `browser.close()` is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.
> 
> ### Example Implementation
> 
> ```python

> 
> async def process_page(page, data):
>     await page.goto('https://example.com/')
>     # Add any additional page interactions here

> 
> async def run_task_with_page(browser, data):

>     try:
>         # Perform processing on the page
>         await process_page(page, data)
>     finally:
>         await page.close()  # Ensure the page is closed
> 
> async def main():
>     browser = await launch(headless=True)
>     data_to_process = ['data1', 'data2', 'data3']
> 
>     try:
>         # Launch tasks concurrently
>         tasks = [run_task_with_page(browser, data) for data in data_to_process]
>         await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
>     except Exception as e:
>         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
>     finally:
>         await browser.close()  # Ensure the browser closes
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     # Create the event loop and run the main function
>     try:
>         asyncio.run(main())
>     except RuntimeError as e:
>         print(f"Runtime error: {e}")
> 
> ```
> 
> ### Key Points:
> 
> - **Try-Except Around Main Logic**: This ensures that any exceptions raised during the task execution are caught, allowing you to handle them as you see fit.
> 
> - **Finally Block**: This guarantees that `browser.close()` gets called no matter what, preventing the `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` you saw before.
> 
> - **Execution**: If a `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to run the event loop (e.g., if it's already closed), it catches that as well.
> 
> This approach should help you manage errors more gracefully and prevent the unhandled exceptions from propagating when you try to close the browser. If you have further questions or issues, feel free to ask!
**user**:
> That's the way I have it set up. `await browser.close()` is always run, since it's in a finally. But that's exactly where the error is getting thrown-- from the finally, when it's trying to close the browser. I don't want my program to spit out exceptions at that point, because we're already done with the event loop then.
**assistant**:
> If `await browser.close()` in the `finally` block is causing the error `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` when you try to close the browser, it suggests that the event loop may already be closed by the time it reaches that point. To prevent this error from being raised, you can handle it explicitly in the `finally` block.
> 
> Here's how to modify your code to suppress the exception while ensuring that `await browser.close()` is safely executed:
> 
> ### Suppressing Errors During Browser Closure
> 
> 1. **Catch Exceptions in the Finally Block**: Wrap the `await browser.close()` call in a try-except block to catch any potential errors that arise from trying to close the browser while the event loop is closed.
> 
> Here's an updated code example:
> 
> ```python
> import asyncio
> from pyppeteer import launch
> 
> async def process_page(page, data):
>     await page.goto('https://example.com/')
>     print(f"Processed: {data}")
> 
> async def run_task_with_page(browser, data):
>     page = await browser.newPage()
>     try:
>         await process_page(page, data)
>     finally:
>         await page.close()
> 
> async def main():
>     browser = await launch(headless=True)
>     data_to_process = ['data1', 'data2', 'data3']
>     
>     try:

>         print(f"Runtime error on event loop execution: {e}")
> ```
> 
> ### Key Modifications:
> 
> - **Try-Except in Finally**: The `await browser.close()` in the `finally` block is now wrapped in a try-except statement. This catches any exceptions that occur during the closure and suppresses them, allowing your program to exit gracefully without printing the error.
> 
> - **Additional Logging (Optional)**: You can add logging or print statements in the catch block to debug if necessary, but you can choose to suppress this completely if you want a silent exit.
> 
> This pattern allows you to safely manage the closing of the browser and suppress any errors that may arise from the closure process, keeping your application's termination clean. Let me know if this resolves your issue or if you have any additional questions!
