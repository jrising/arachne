**user**:
> How can I find an political economy model of the relationship between resource extraction and development/poverty?
**assistant**:
> There are several ways to locate a political economy model of the relationship between resource extraction and development/poverty:
> 
> 1. **Academic Research**: A good start would be to search for academic literature. You can use databases such as JSTOR, Google Scholar, or your university's library portal to find research papers that model this relationship. Search for keywords like "political economy", "resource extraction", "development", and "poverty". Relevant papers usually include models used by the authors, or references to models used in previous research.
> 
> 2. **Working Papers and Reports**: Working papers and reports from international organizations like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United Nations Development Programme  (UNDP) often include models of political-economic relationships. They have a wealth of information accessible on their websites and digital libraries.
> 
> 3. **Economic Journals**: Look for economic theory and development journals which often publish models on resource extraction and development/poverty. Some relevant journals may include "World Development", "Journal of Development Economics", "Journal of Political Economy", and "Review of Economic Studies".
> 
> 4. **Books**: There are comprehensive books on political economy that may include models on resource extraction and its impact on development. Examples include "The Political Economy of Development and Underdevelopment" by Charles K. Wilber and Kenneth P. Jameson, and "The Resource Curse in a Post-Communist Regime: Russia in Comparative Perspective" by Douglas B. Shaw.
> 
> 5. **Open Access Data and Modelling Platforms**: Resources like the Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework (IAMF), Center for Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy (RDCEP), Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), and various other platforms offer data and modeling tools that can be used to study these relationships.
> 
> Remember to critically evaluate any model you find. Models are simplifications of complex realities and may not capture all dynamics or variables. You'll also want to evaluate their methodological rigor and relevance to the specific context you're studying.
