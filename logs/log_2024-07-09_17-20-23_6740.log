> voice. Please keep the following in mind in writing it:
> 
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> Conditional Features
> 
> Academic Papers: In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."
> 
> Personal Letters: Your personal letter shows a warmer and more emotional tone. You use rich, descriptive language and share personal anecdotes to create a sense of intimacy and connection. You also show a playful and creative side, like how you derived meanings and historical connections in your son's name. "You are named after the chemical symbol for gold, Au (â˜‰), the most versatile of the metals, in honor of your great-grandmother, Goldie Newman..."
> 
> Writing for the Public: In public-oriented writing, you adopt a more accessible, explanatory style. Your writing is more focused on communicating complex ideas in an easy-to-understand manner. You balance your expertise with clarity and relevance to ensure the material is accessible to a broad audience. "Agriculture is going to be one of the sectors most disrupted by climate change. Our ability to produce food relies on a stable climate. Crops and management practices are carefully catered to local climate conditions, including the timing and intensity of rainfall, the length of growing seasons, and the complex biology of soil."
> I use Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to evaluate the drivers of variation in the social cost of CO2 (SCC) and social cost of methane (SCCH4). I would like you to draft up an appendix section for the academic paper. The full appendix section would do the following:
> 1. Introduce GSA, with appropriate literature.
> 2. Explain the steps of the analysis:
>  - I use 1000 Monte Carlo draws with the same configuration as the main results of the paper.
>  - For each MC, I extract 17 parameters describing AIS, 2 for Amazon Dieback, 2 for AMOC, 20 for tipping point interactions, 2 for OMH (when used), 1 for ISM, 2 for SAF, and 2 representing climate sensitivity. There are also 2 for temperature damages, and 1 for SLR damages, but uncertainty on these is not included in the standard results.
>  - A couple of notes for some parameters that are not read directly from the model:
>     - Climate sensitivity is represented by the first and second difference of GMST in 2010 (prior to the endogenous effects of tipping points)-- so, T_2010 - T_2009 and (T_2010 - T_2009) - (T_2009 - T_2008).

> ### Appendix: Global Sensitivity Analysis
> 
> #### Introduction to Global Sensitivity Analysis
> 
> Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is a methodological approach used to understand the influence of input variables on the output of a model. By systematically varying inputs and observing the resulting changes in outputs, GSA allows researchers to identify which variables contribute most significantly to the uncertainty in model predictions. This technique is critical in assessing the robustness of complex models and has been widely adopted in environmental and climate economics (Saltelli et al., 2008; Pianosi et al., 2016).
> 
> In the context of climate change economics, GSA is particularly valuable for evaluating the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and the Social Cost of Methane (SCCH4). Several studies have employed GSA to investigate the drivers of variability in SCC estimates (e.g., Pizer et al., 2014; Diaz, 2014). Here, we extend this approach to include the interactions of various tipping points and their implications for SCC and SCCH4.
> 
> #### Methodology
> 
> To perform the GSA, I use 1000 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with the same configuration as the main results presented in this paper.
> 
> ##### Steps of the Analysis
> 
> 1. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**
>    - A total of 1000 MC draws are generated, maintaining consistency with the main analysis in terms of input configurations and parameter distributions.
> 
> 2. **Parameter Extraction:**
>    - For each MC simulation, parameters are extracted for various key components that influence the SCC and SCCH4. This includes:
>      - **Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS):** 17 parameters
>      - **Amazon Dieback:** 2 parameters
>      - **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC):** 2 parameters
>      - **Tipping Point Interactions:** 20 parameters
>      - **Ocean Methane Hydrate (OMH) (when used):** 2 parameters
>      - **Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM):** 1 parameter
>      - **Sea Ice-Albedo Feedback (SAF):** 2 parameters
>      - **Climate Sensitivity:** 2 parameters
>      - **Temperature Damages:** 2 parameters (note: uncertainty on these is not included in the standard results)
>      - **Sea Level Rise (SLR) Damages:** 1 parameter (note: uncertainty on these is also not included in the standard results)
> 
> 3. **Special Cases:**
>    - **Climate Sensitivity:** This is represented not by a single parameter but by analyzing the differences in Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST):
>      - **First Difference:** \( T_{2010} - T_{2009} \)
>      - **Second Difference:** \( (T_{2010} - T_{2009}) - (T_{2009} - T_{2008}) \)
> 
> #### Analysis and Results
> 
> The systematic extraction of these parameters allows for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis across a broad range of climatic and socio-economic factors. By iterative examination through MC simulations, the GSA identifies which parameters introduce the most variability into the SCC and SCCH4 estimates, providing insights into key areas where further research or policy focus is required.
