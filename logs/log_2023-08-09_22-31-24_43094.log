> Suppose we want to take climate deniers seriously in saying that their conclusions result from a set of fundamental (perhaps conspiratorial) assumptions; and to take them seriously we want to do robust policy decision making under the uncertainty about which set of assumptions (scientific or denier) are correct. What would that kind of uncertainty be called?
**assistant**:
> The kind of uncertainty you are referring to would be called "deep uncertainty". Deep uncertainty exists when the parties to a decision do not know, or cannot agree on, the system model that relates action to consequences, the probabilities of various inputs to these models, and/or the value of alternative outcomes. 
> 
> In your case, the deep uncertainty arises from a fundamental disagreement about the underlying assumptions regarding climate science--between those who accept the consensus among climate scientists and those who deny it. The idea of robust decision making under deep uncertainty is to identify policies that are robust, meaning that they work relatively well, compared to the alternatives, over a broad range of plausible futures.

> What is epistemological uncertainty? What would ontological uncertainty be?
**assistant**:
> Epistemological uncertainty refers to uncertainty related to knowledge and understanding. It arises when we are uncertain about the reliability, accuracy, or completeness of our knowledge, data, or models. Epistemological uncertainty highlights the limitations and gaps in our understanding of a particular subject, which can impact decision-making processes.
> 
> Ontological uncertainty, on the other hand, refers to uncertainty about the nature of reality itself. It suggests that we are uncertain about the fundamental components, structure, or dynamics of the world or system under consideration. Ontological uncertainty often arises when dealing with complex, dynamic systems where there may be multiple, conflicting ontological theories or perspectives.
> 
> In both cases, uncertainty stems from our lack of knowledge or understanding. Epistemological uncertainty is concerned with how we acquire and interpret knowledge, while ontological uncertainty is concerned with the nature of reality itself.
