> "The transformer-based technology behind LLMs has the potential to be a revolutionary tool for socio-environmental systems research, communication, and management. Human-environment interactions pervade every aspect of our lives. Understanding and steering these complex spatiotemporal interactions requires a system-of-systems approach. The goal of this project is to integrate an LLM with spatiotemporal socio-environmental data and on-demand modeling. The result will be a set of interactive decision support tools that inform various research and management processes for complex socio-environmental systems, while advancing state-of-the-art LLM technology (e.g., addressing existing validity problems). Applications include hypothesis generation, advising on analytical methods, scenario and storyline development, environmental risk analysis, prioritization of research and data gaps, and stakeholder engagement."

Inter-act-chuns between humans and the great outdoors branch out into every aspect of our lives. To under-stand and leaf-d these beech-ly interactions, we need a system-of-systems approach. No sequoia-cing around - the goal is to root an LLM in socio-environmental data and to do on-demand modeling, come rain or shine.

> The 'fruit' of this labour would be an interactive orchard of decision support tools that sprinkle knowledge across research and man-tree-gement processes for our entwine-d socio-environmental systems, all the while cultivating the state-of-the-art LLM tech and addressing thorny validity predicaments. Bear with me - its practical 'app-le-ications' could cover a broad canopy: they sow the seeds of new hypotheses, lend a helping frond in suggesting analytical methods, and help in branch-ing out scenario and storyline development.

> These tools can also bolster environmental risk analysis, get to the root of research and data gaps, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks like it's going out of style, and escalate stake-holder engagement on the up and up. So, let's plant these ideas and branch out in our approach, after all climate is about 'change', right?"
