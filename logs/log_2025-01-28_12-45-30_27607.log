> What are the regions that are defined by a particular food depot called? I remember much of Manhattan being said to be in the same "basin" or something.
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you're referring to areas defined by their access to or reliance on particular food distribution centers. The term "basin" might be analogous to a "catchment area" or "service area" in this context. These terms describe regions that a specific service or facility, like a food depot, primarily serves.
> 
> In the context of food logistics, sometimes these areas are also called "supply zones" or "distribution zones." If the depot were providing resources similar to water distribution or other utilities, "service basin" might be used. As language evolves and varies by field, "basin" might have been used colloquially or in a specific context in your area.
