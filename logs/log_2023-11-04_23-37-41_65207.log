**user**:
> If I call an async function in javascript, how can I then await for the response to the promise?
**assistant**:
> In JavaScript, you can use the `await` operator to wait for a Promise. You can use it only within an `async` function.
> 
> Here's an example of how to use it:
> 
> ```javascript
> async function myFunction() {
>   try {
>     let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
>     let data = await response.json();
>     return data;
>   } catch (error) {
>     console.error(error);
>   }
> }
> 
> myFunction()
>   .then(data => console.log(data))
>   .catch(error => console.error(error));
> ```
> 
> In this code, `await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')` pauses the code execution within the async function, waiting for the fetch call to resolve, after which it resumes the function execution and returns the resolved value. Similarly, the `await response.json()` call waits for the Promise returned by `.json()` to resolve and returns that value.
> 
> Note that if you want to use await in the top level of your code (outside any async functions), you can use an immediately invoked async function expression (IIFE). 
> 
> Like this:
> 
> ```javascript
> (async () => {
>   try {
>     let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
>     let data = await response.json();
>     console.log(data);
>   } catch (error) {
>     console.error(error);
>   }
> })();
> ```
> This way, you are able to use await at the top level of your code. This is especially common in script files and modules.
