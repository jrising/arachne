**user**:
> How do I write a list of dictionaries in yaml?
**assistant**:
> YAML (short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-friendly data serialization standard. A list of dictionaries in YAML can be written like this:
> 
> ```yaml
> - name: James
>   age: 42
>   children: 2
> - name: Susan
>   age: 39
>   children: 1
> - name: Mike
>   age: 22
>   children: 0
> ```
> 
> In this YAML snippet, we have a list of three dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a person and includes keys for `name`, `age`, and `children`. 
> 
> A list in YAML starts with a dash (`-`) along with a space. Every time you see a new `-`, it represents another element in the list. Each key-value pair within a dictionary is denoted by a colon (`:`), and the dictionary itself is established by indents. Make sure you are consistent with spaces vs. tabs, as YAML cares about this.
> 
> Remember, it's crucial to keep proper indentation and spacing between the dash, key and value in YAML for correct parsing.
