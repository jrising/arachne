> Today, many cities, counties and states have climate action goals that require reducing the energy in existing
> buildings. To meet these goals, more than 40 jurisdictions have publicly committed to passing a building
> performance standard (BPS) by 2024 through the National BPS Coalition, representing a major shift in building
> operations. Alongside this influx of policy development, building owners, energy providers, climate risk assessors,
> and lenders need to prepare for compliance in an effort to quantify and mitigate the substantial fees that these
> policies can carry. Many building owners aren’t aware of these policies, and may be at risk of noncompliance or of
> missing strategic opportunities.

> IMT wants you to remain competitive in your offerings as these policies are developed and adopted. Our

> GREEN LEASING 101
> Green Lease Leaders is a free, three year recognition program for landlords, tenants, and teams who integrate green
> leasing into their standard leasing practices. The program includes three levels of recognition: Silver, Gold, and Platinum.
> Since 2014, Green Lease Leaders impacted over 6.4 billion square feet domestically and internationally.
> Green lease language breaks down the split-incentive barrier and fairly aligns financial and environmental benefits of
> sustainability initiatives to landlords and tenants. A green lease allows the landlord and tenant to save money, prioritize the
> ESG initiatives most important to both parties, and ensure the efficient operation of buildings for the lifetime of the lease.
> Green leases have the potential to save up to 22% in utility costs.
> The next phase of green leasing is performance-based leasing, which incorporates building level utility consumption
> reduction targets into the lease language. Performance-based leases can be an effective tool to support compliance with
> emerging building performance standards.
