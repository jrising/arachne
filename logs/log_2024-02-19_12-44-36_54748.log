> I am writing a statement to apply to the "Energy and Climate-Tech Innovation Policy Boot Camp". Here is the description:
> ===
> George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government and the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability are pleased to invite applicants to participate in their 2024 energy and climate-tech innovation policy “boot camp” for early career researchers. The Mason-Maryland boot camp’s main purpose is to strengthen researchers’ understanding of how energy and climate-tech policy is made, so their research has greater impact on real-world clean energy and climate innovation outcomes. It is supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
> 
> A central feature of the boot camp will be face-to-face discussions with key players shaping the energy and climate-tech policy landscape in the United States. These discussions will span Congress, the executive branch, international organizations, NGOs, businesses, and other players. The 2024 event will build on the success of prior boot camps in 2019 and 2022. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Energy Program will partner with Mason and Maryland to assist in the creation of a high-quality program.
> 
> Professor David M. Hart of the Schar School is the boot camp’s director. Kathleen M. Kennedy of the Center for Global Sustainability, a 2022 boot camp participant, is the boot camp’s co-director. A distinguished panel of scholars serve as the boot camp’s advisory committee.
> 
> Researchers with a background in any discipline who meet these three qualifications are invited to apply:
> 
> Earned a Ph.D. in 2014 or later;
> Published research in the open literature on energy and climate innovation; and
> Actively pursuing a research program in an academic setting.
> Female, African-American, and Hispanic researchers are particularly encouraged to apply. Researchers from outside the United States are welcome to apply, but must describe a research program that includes U.S. energy and climate-tech policy issues.
> 
> The boot camp will be held in Washington, D.C., from June 2 to June 7, 2024. It will be an immersive experience. All participants must participate throughout the week. Applicants are asked not to apply unless they can make a full commitment to participate for the entire week.
> 
> Thanks to generous support from the Sloan Foundation, the Schar School will cover all expenses for the boot camp, including participants’ travel, food, lodging, and local transportation.
> 
> To apply, please send the following two items to climatec@gmu.edu:
> 
> A statement of 750-1,000 words that describes your interests and qualifications; and
> A curriculum vitae.
> In addition, each applicant must be recommended by a researcher who is familiar with the applicant’s work. The recommendation should briefly describe the applicant’s accomplishments and potential future contributions to the field of energy and climate innovation policy and assess how the applicant would benefit from the boot camp. The letter should be submitted directly by the recommender to climatec@gmu.edu, indicating the name of the applicant in the subject line.
> 
> Selection criteria will be:
> 
> Quality of research;
> Potential to gain from participation; and
> Diversity across disciplines, issues, methods, and demographic groups.

> 
> Dear Drs. Hart and Kennedy,
> 
> I am very excited to apply to the 2024 Energy and Climate-Tech Innovation Policy Boot Camp. I was encouraged to apply by a former participant, Eugenie Dugoua. I am an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational modeler, with my work to-date focusing on climate change impacts. At the same time, my work to bridge disciplinary gaps has helped me develop strong relationships with the mitigation research community. I am particularly interested in this Boot Camp as an opportunity to evolve my career and better engage around policy solutions to climate change.
> 
> My research is on the interactions between economic and environmental systems, aimed at identifying policy opportunities for their effective management. My core research to-date has focused on the economic analysis of the risks of climate change, including improving impact and risk estimates, developing integrated models of climate policy, and grappling with risks that are currently missing from policy discussions. I draw upon quantitative techniques from multiple fields to develop systems perspectives. I also firmly believe that integrating multiple disciplines is essential addressing global issues, and regularly collaborate with climate scientists, process-based
> modelers, data scientists, and macroeconomists.
> 
> I have written or contributed to 26 published articles, including papers in both top natural science journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) and top economics journals (QJE, JAERE). Additionally, I produced five public reports, four as lead author. Relevant to this Boot Camp, I have written reports on loss & damage, on comparing mitigation costs and benefits, and on just energy transitions.
> 
> Beyond my research, I have been an active member of the sustainable development community. I have been engaged in the work of closing gaps between academic work on climate risks and governance, by coordinating stakeholder and interdisciplinary researcher workshops and advising government and intergovernmental bodies such as the EPA, CEA, the UK’s CCC, and IPBES.
> 
> Moving forward, I hope to do research that is more relevant and timely for solving the challenges of climate change in the United States. Rapid decarbonization will require large-scale government and industry collaboration (e.g., around EV charging networks and carbon sequestration), well-designed transition policies (e.g., driving the replacement of fossil fuel plants), and a pipeline of startups to address an almost endless list of emerging economic and engineering issues. I believe that my background can support the development of the new energy ecosystem in several ways, as my research continues to evolve:
> -	My work in complex systems and spatiotemporal optimization provides an approach for bringing together energy system realities with real-world policy.
> -	Any transition needs to prove equitable and to plan for fossil-fuel-dependent workers and communities to garner the necessary support. My work on just transitions, including as a past leader of the Research Network on Energy Workforce Transitions, provides a basis for deeper addressing these issues.
> -	My pre-PhD background is in engineering and software development, connecting to the importance that climate-tech and innovation have in this boot camp.

**assistant**:
> Your current draft covers many of the required points and provides an effective portrait of your qualifications, interests, and achievements. However, to meet the word count and provide a more detailed application, here are a few suggestions for extension:
> 
> 1. Expansion on Specific Research Projects - You might want to provide further detail on one or two major research projects that you've led or been heavily involved in, particularly those that have a strong connection to energy and climate-tech policy.
> 
> 2. Elaboration on Specific Papers - Consider discussing the key findings and impacts of one or two of your most influential papers that are related to this field.
> 
> 3. Greater Emphasis on Policy Engagement - Elaborating on your engagement with policy can further solidify your strong candidacy for the program. Who have you collaborated with, and what were the results? Specific examples will help concrete your claims.
> 
> 4. Your Vision and Plan for Improvement - It's clear in your letter about your continued commitment to climate change and energy innovation research. Consider expanding on how the boot camp will enhance your ability to continue and expand your research. What's your vision for the next few years in terms of research focuses?
> 
> 5. Alignment with Boot Camp - To enhance your compelling nature of this application, it might help to draw more explicit connections with the boot camp's offerings and mission. How will specific aspects of the boot camp help you achieve your goals, both short-term and long-term?
