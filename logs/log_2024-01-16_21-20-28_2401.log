**user**:
> I would like to use jquery's Menu class to set up a kind of infinite menu on a site. The idea is that it would start with the first and second levels loaded (so that arrows would properly appear on the first level to items that have a second level), and then when the first level item is chosen, but before the second-level menu is opened up, an ajax query would collect the third level under each of the items on that second level, so that the second level would have the right arrows. And so on.

> My project uses flask, and let's assume that I have a function on the python side `get_submenus` which returns a list of tuples (ROOTID, LABEL). Can you give me the necessary html template, javascript, and other flask functions to set this up?
**assistant**:
> It's a great idea to use jQuery's Menu class to setup such a menu. The overall implementation of this concept involves Flask, jQuery, and AJAX. Here is a basic demonstration on how to set up this:
> 
> On the Python Flask side, you'd have an endpoint to return submenu items via AJAX. It could be designed like this:
> 
> ```python
> from flask import Flask, jsonify
> app = Flask(__name__)
> 
> @app.route('/get_submenus/<root_id>', methods=['GET'])
> def get_submenus(root_id):
>     # This function returns a list of tuples (ROOTID, LABEL)
>     submenus = [
>         # ... 
>     ]
>     return jsonify(submenus)
> ```
> 
> On the HTML side, you'd initially load your menu into a nested list, and jQuery turns this list into the menu. Here's a basic template for your needs:
> 
> ```html
> <div id="my-menu">
>     <ul>
>         <!-- Load first and second levels of the menu -->
>         <li>
>             <div>First level item</div>
>             <ul>
>                 <li class="second-level" data-root-id="second-level-root-id">
>                     <div>Second level item</div>
>                 </li>
>                 <!-- more second level items -->
>             </ul>
>         </li>
>         <!-- more first level items -->
>     </ul>
> </div>
> 
> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
> <script src="/static/my_menu.js"></script>
> ```
> 
> In JavaScript (`my_menu.js`), you would first initialize the menu, then bind your AJAX loading to the `menuselect` event triggered by jQuery UI. This will fetch the sub-menu data when a first or second level item is selected:
> 
> ```javascript
> $(function() {
>     var $menu = $("#my-menu");
> 
>     $menu.menu({
>         select: function(event, ui) {
>             var $selectedItem = $(ui.item),
>                 $nestedMenu = $selectedItem.find("ul");
> 
>             if ($nestedMenu.length) return; // skip if nested menu exists
>             
>             var rootId = $selectedItem.data("root-id");
> 
>             $.ajax({
>                 url: '/get_submenus/' + rootId,
>                 type: 'GET',
>                 dataType: 'json',
>                 success: function(data){
>                     // Create third level menu with data returned from AJAX
>                     var $thirdLevelMenu = $('<ul>');
>                     $.each(data, function(i, item) {
>                         $thirdLevelMenu.append('<li><div>' + item[1] + '</div></li>');
>                     });
> 
>                     // Append third level menu to second level item
>                     $selectedItem.append($thirdLevelMenu);
> 
>                     // Refresh menu to incorporate newly added items
>                     $menu.menu("refresh");
>                 }
>             });
>         }
>     });
> });
> ```
> Note that this is a basic demonstration of how it might be done, assuming simple menu requirements. Depending on the structure of your data and the complexity of your menu, you may add further customization and error handling.
