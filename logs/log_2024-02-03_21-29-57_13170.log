**user**:
> In javascript (jquery) how can I send off a whole bunch of ajax requests and then do something when they are all done. And is that ill-advised or fine procedure?
**assistant**:
> In JavaScript with jQuery, you can send multiple AJAX requests and handle them when they're all done using jQuery's `$.when()` method. The `$.when()` method provides a way to execute callback functions based on zero or more Deferred objects (usually Ajax requests).
> 
> Here is a simple example of how you might do this:
> 
> ```javascript
> $.when( 
>     $.get("/api/data1"), 
>     $.get("/api/data2"), 
>     $.get("/api/data3")
> ).done(function(result1, result2, result3) {
>     // This callback function will execute once all AJAX requests have completed
>     // `result1`, `result2`, and `result3` are arrays holding the results of each AJAX request
>     var data1 = result1[0]; 
>     var data2 = result2[0];
>     var data3 = result3[0];
> 
>     // Do something with the results
>     console.log(data1, data2, data3);
> }).fail(function(error) {
>     // This function will execute if any of the AJAX requests fail 
>     console.error("An error occurred: ", error);
> });
> ```
> 
> As each AJAX request completes, jQuery invokes the `.done()` callback with an array of arguments for each AJAX request, hence `result1[0]`, `result2[0]`, and `result3[0]`.
> 
> While this approach isn't inherently ill-advised, it does have implications worth considering:
> 
> - **Server load**: Making many AJAX requests simultaneously could lead to an excessive server load, especially if the server isn't configured to handle multiple simultaneous requests efficiently.
>   
> - **UX**: Users could experience a delay while all the AJAX requests are being processed, especially on slower networks. If this pattern is used extensively, it might be worth considering ways to show the progress of these requests or to lazy-load parts of the data.
> 
> - **Error handling**: If one of the AJAX requests fails, then the `fail` function will be called. You'll need to decide how to handle such scenarios.
> 
> - **Browser limitations**: Browsers also have limitations on the number of simultaneous connections they can have to a single server (six is the limit for modern browsers).
> 
> As with many things in software development, it's all about understanding the trade-offs and making decisions that are appropriate for your specific use case.
**user**:
> What if I don't know how many requests are going to be sent, so I don't know how many arguments to include in my done function?
**assistant**:
> If you don't know in advance how many requests you'll be sending and therefore don't know how many arguments to expect in the `done` function, you can use the `arguments` object within the `done` callback to access the results dynamically.
> 
> The `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function. In the context of the `done` callback in an AJAX request, it will contain the results of the completed requests.
> 
> Here's an example of how you can handle an unknown number of AJAX requests using `$.when()` and the `arguments` object:
> 
> ```javascript
> var requests = []; // Array to store the AJAX requests
> 
> // Push your AJAX requests into the `requests` array
> requests.push($.get("/api/data1"));
> requests.push($.get("/api/data2"));
> // ... Add more requests as needed
> 
> $.when.apply($, requests).done(function() {
>     // This callback function will be called once all AJAX requests have completed
> 
>     // Access the results dynamically using the `arguments` object
>     for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
>         var result = arguments[i][0];
>         // Process each result as needed
>         console.log(result);
>     }
> }).fail(function(error) {
>     // This function will execute if any of the AJAX requests fail
>     console.error("An error occurred: ", error);
> });
> ```
> 
> Explanation:
> - We create an array called `requests` to store all the AJAX requests.
> - We push each request into the `requests` array using `push()`.
> - We use `$.when.apply($, requests)` to apply the `$.when()` function to all the requests. The `apply()` method allows us to pass an array of arguments to a function.
> - Inside the `done` function, we loop through the `arguments` object to access each result dynamically. In this example, `arguments[i][0]` gives you the result of the i-th AJAX request.
> 
> By using the `arguments` object and dynamically iterating over it, you don't need to know the exact number of arguments in advance, allowing you to handle an unknown number of requests.
