> Hi James,
> 
> I just wanted to follow up and apologize for not properly taking accountability for the slow progress on the spreadsheet. I haven’t wanted to share for the fear of seemingly creating excuses, but I see it is now affecting my productivity and working relationships. There have been some personal developments in my household after Ben’s accident that triggered a difficult period for my mental health. I am happy to share details if you like, but I also don’t want to unprofessionally over share. There is a lot of change happening in my personal life that will unfortunately mean I am not capable of giving my 100% as much as I try - some days are easier than others.

> With that said, I know we haven’t worked together before so I do realise you don’t already have a baseline trust/perception of how I normally work. Once I commit to a deadline, I meet it, even if it’s not in the most linear of ways. While things may look concerning now, I have genuine faith that I will catch up in time to stay on track with our deadlines.
> 
> However, I completely understand if these ways of working are not comfortable for you and I would be open to speaking with Nick and the team about maybe stepping away a bit from the project if it’s helpful to bring someone else instead? I wanted to reach out to you before I formalise anything as my intention is to make things easier for the team, not harder, but I also need to accept that this summer might be a particularly challenging phase for my mental health.
> 
> Apologies for the long email and for my candidness. Let me know if you’d like to have a call to chat any of this over.

> While I fully understand the need to navigate personal difficulties, it's important that we maintain continuous progress on the project. This isn't solely about meeting deadlines; I need the information from the spreadsheet to develop the necessary tools that rely on this data.

> Currently, we have 18 papers in the spreadsheet. In order to stay on track, could we aim to add another 18 papers by the end of the month? This will help ensure that we remain aligned with our project goals and timelines.
