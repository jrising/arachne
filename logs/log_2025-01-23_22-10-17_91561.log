> I'm using cleveref in LaTeX to handle references to my appendix, but I want these to be labeled "SI" rather than "Appendix". How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by customizing the label name used by the `cleveref` package for references to the appendix. You will need to redefine the `\crefname` and `\Crefname` macros for the appendix environment. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```latex
> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage{cleveref}
> 
> % Redefine the cleveref names for the appendix
> \crefname{appendix}{SI}{SIs}
> \Crefname{appendix}{SI}{SIs}
> 
> \begin{document}
> 
> \appendix
> 
> \section{Sample Appendix Section}
> \label{sec:1}
> 
> Refer to \Cref{sec:1} for the sample appendix section.
> 
> \end{document}
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> 
> - `\crefname{appendix}{SI}{SIs}` redefines the lowercase reference for appendices.
> - `\Crefname{appendix}{SI}{SIs}` redefines the capitalized reference for appendices.
> 
> This customization changes how references to appendices are labeled throughout your document, so they will appear as "SI" instead of "Appendix".
