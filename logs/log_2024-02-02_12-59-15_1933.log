> 
> Data Policies and Principles
> Recognizing the crucial role of open and effective data and information exchange to the Belmont Challenge, the Belmont Forum adopted open Data Policy and Principles based on the recommendations from the Community Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP) at its 2015 annual meeting of Principals in Oslo, Norway. The policy signals a commitment by funders of global environmental change research to increase access to scientific data, a step widely recognized as essential to making informed decisions in the face of rapid changes affecting the Earth’s environment.
> 
> Belmont Forum Data Policy and Principles
> The Belmont Forum adopts this data policy and the following principles to widen access to data and promote its long-term preservation in global change research; help improve data management and exploitation; coordinate and integrate disparate organizational and technical elements; fill critical global e-infrastructure gaps; share best practices; and foster new data literacy.
> 
> The Belmont Forum recognizes that significant advances in open access to data have been achieved and implementation of this policy and these principles requires support by a highly skilled workforce. The Belmont Forum recommends a broad-based training and education curriculum as an integral part of research programs and encourages researchers to be aware of, and plan for, the costs of data intensive research. The Belmont Forum’s ambition is that this policy and these principles will take positive steps toward establishing a global, interoperable e-infrastructure based on cost-effective solutions that can help enable actionable and societally beneficial science.
> 
> Data should be:
> 
> Discoverable through catalogues and search engines
> Accessible as open data by default, and made available with minimum time delay
> Understandable in a way that allows researchers—including those outside the discipline of origin—to use them
> Manageable and protected from loss for future use in sustainable, trustworthy repositories
> The Belmont Forum and its members will support and promote this data policy and principles with the intent of making these data principles enforceable over time.
> 
> “This policy of openness paves the way for science and funding agencies collaborating internationally to reinforce the excellence and integrity of science,” said Kurt Vandenberghe, then co-chair of the Belmont Forum. “It will facilitate innovation through taking advantage of research data and results and, most of all, it will enhance global scientific collaboration and science diplomacy as essential conditions for developing more sustainable societies.”
> 
> Additional Detail
> The Policy and Principles closely follow the data principles promoted in the CSIP:
> 
> Research data must be:
> 
> Discoverable through catalogues and search engines, with data access and use conditions, including licenses, clearly indicated. Data should have appropriate persistent, unique and resolvable identifiers.
> Accessible by default, and made available with minimum time delay, except where international and national policies or legislation preclude the sharing of data as Open Data. Data sources should always be cited.
> Understandable and interoperable in a way that allows researchers, including those outside the discipline of origin, to use them. Preference should be given to non-proprietary international and community standards via data e-infrastructures that facilitate access, use and interpretation of data. Data must also be reusable and thus require proper contextual information and metadata, including provenance, quality and uncertainty indicators. Provision should be made for multiple languages.
> Manageable and protected from loss for future use in sustainable, trustworthy repositories with data management policies and plans for all data at the project and institutional levels. Metrics should be exploited to facilitate the ability to measure return on investment, and can be used to implement incentive schemes for researchers, as well as provide measures of data quality.
> Supported by a highly skilled workforce and a broad-based training and education curriculum as an integral part of research programs.
> ===
> The FAIR Data Principles
> 
> Preamble
> One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science is to facilitate knowledge discovery by assisting humans and machines in their discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and their associated algorithms and workflows. Here, we describe FAIR – a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  The term FAIR was launched at a Lorentz workshop in 2014, the resulting  FAIR principles were published in 2016.
> 
> To be Findable:
> F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
> F2. data are described with rich metadata.
> F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.
> F4. metadata specify the data identifier.
> 
> To be Accessible:
> A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.
> A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.
> A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.
> A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.
> 
> To be Interoperable:
> I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
> I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
> I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.
> 
> To be Re-usable:
> R1. (meta)data have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
> R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
> R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.
> R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.

> Link	Chapter XI.D.4. https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp	 	 
> Principles and Implementation Approach	Investigators are expected to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of work under NSF grants. Grantees are expected to encourage and facilitate such sharing.	 	 
> When Data are to be Publicly Shared	"within a reasonable amount of time"	 	 
> Data Management Planning	Proposals must include a document of no more than two pages uploaded under "Data Management Plan" in the supplementary documentation section of FastLane. This supplementary document should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results (see Chapter XI.D.4), and may include: the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project; the standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies); policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements; policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives; and plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them. Data management requirements and plans specific to the Directorate, Office, Division, Program, or other NSF unit, relevant to a proposal are available at: http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp. If guidance specific to the program is not available, then the requirements established in this section apply. Simultaneously submitted collaborative proposals and proposals that include subawards are a single unified project and should include only one supplemental combined Data Management Plan, regardless of the number of non-lead collaborative proposals or subawards included. A valid Data Management Plan may include only the statement that no detailed plan is needed, as long as the statement is accompanied by a clear justification. Proposers who feel that the plan cannot fit within the limit of two pages may use part of the 15-page Project Description for additional data management information. Proposers are advised that the Data Management Plan must not be used to circumvent the 15-page Project Description limitation. The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as an integral part of the proposal, considered under Intellectual Merit or Broader Impacts or both, as appropriate for the scientific community of relevance.

> Link	https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Open_access/1254008537671	 	 
> Principles and Implementation Approach	The Research Council’s Policy on Open Access to Research Data aims to ensure that such data are accessible to relevant users, on equal terms, and at the lowest possible cost. The guidelines in the policy apply to all data generated by projects funded by the Research Council – with a few exceptions. The policy is formulated as a set of recommendations – not requirements. The Research Council’s various funding instruments will be adapted to accommodate the principles in the policy. One possible measure is to introduce a requirement that research projects incorporate data management plans. The Research Council would use these plans as a basis for accepting data archiving costs as part of the operational expenses of funded projects. In addition, the Research Council will focus on encouraging the establishment of well-designed infrastructure for data storage and data management, in part through the National Financing Initiative for Research Infrastructure.	 	 
> Exclusions and Limitations in Policy Approach	Some data may not be made openly accessible as a matter of course. Data must not be made openly accessible if doing so could pose a threat to personal or national security or conflict with the applicable statutory framework regarding the protection of personal privacy or other legal provisions. Data that have commercial value and are generated in projects in which a company is the contractual partner with the Research Council may be exempted from the general principle of open access. In these cases, it is recommended that the data are made available after a certain period of time, for instance after three or five years. Data that are highly impractical or costly to make accessible may also be exempted from the general principle of open access. There are a variety of challenges associated with making some datasets openly accessible. The reasons for restricting access include: Security concerns When open access to the data may threaten personal or national security, the datasets must not be made openly accessible. Sensitive personal data When open access to the data conflicts with the applicable statutory framework regarding the protection of personal privacy, the datasets must not be made openly accessible. Other legal factors When open access to the data conflicts with other legal provisions, the datasets must not be made openly accessible. Commercial factors Data that have commercial value and are generated in projects in which a company is the contractual partner with the Research Council may be exempted from the general principle of open access. In these cases, it is recommended that the data are made available after a certain period of time, preferably after three or five years.	 	 
> When Data are to be Publicly Shared	3.0 Research data should be made accessible at an early stage. 3.1 The data used as the basis for scientific articles should be made accessible as soon as possible, and never later than at the time of publication. 3.2 Other data that may be of interest for other research should be made accessible within a reasonable amount of time, and never later than three years after the project has concluded.	 	 
> How Data are to be Publically Shared	The Research Council has drawn up a set of guidelines for the archiving, dissemination and sharing of research data. The guidelines will be followed up through the Research Council’s research funding instruments and through the National Financing Initiative for Research Infrastructure. 1.0 Research data should be stored/archived in a safe and secure manner. 1.1 The data should be stored in secure archives, either in a central repository at the relevant institution or in national archives. 2.0 Research data should be made accessible for reuse. 2.1 Research data should be made accessible to all relevant users, on equal terms, as long as there are no legal, ethical or security-related reasons to preclude this. 6.0 Research data should be made accessible at the lowest possible cost. 6.1 Metadata should be made accessible at no charge and be published in a way so that they may be harvested and used in research data searches. 6.2 Research data should preferably be made accessible at no charge. 6.3 The price of access to research data should never be higher than the actual costs of making them available.	 	 
> Metadata and/or Documentation to be Included with Data	4.0 Research data should be accompanied by standardised metadata. 4.1 The metadata should enable others to search for and use the data. 4.2 The metadata should follow international standards. 4.3 The metadata should describe the quality of the data. Metadata should be made accessible at no charge and be published in a way so that they may be harvested and used in research data searches.	 	 
> Terms of Data ‘Licensing” (e.g. Re-use/Re-distribution /Derivatives)	Research data should be provided with a license for access, reuse and redistribution. 5.1 The license should be internationally recognised. 5.2 The license should set as few restrictions as possible on the access, reuse and redistribution of the data.	 	 
> Data Management Planning	7.0 Research data should be provided with a long-term plan. 7.1 A plan should be prepared for the management of data that are considered to have longterm value. 7.2 The projects should specifically address how research data that are not considered to have long-term value should be managed, or if relevant destroyed, after a certain period of time.

> 
>  - Output Protection*:  	How do you intend to manage the data and digital outputs during the project to ensure their long-term value is protected?
> For example, where will the data be held during the project, who will have access, and will a specialised data manager be part of the project team?
> 
>  - Post-Project Data Management*:  	How and by whom will the data and other digital outputs be managed after the project ends to ensure their long-term accessibility?
> For example, will the outputs be published with a Persistent Unique and Resolvable Identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier [DOI], Accession Number, Handle, etc.), and be placed in a recognised, trustworthy long-term domain or other repository or data centre? When will this occur? (Further information about repositories include, but is not limited to, the re3data.org registry of research data repositories, CoreTrustSeal list of certified data repositories, etc.)
> 
>  - Restrictions*:  	What restrictions, if any, do you anticipate could be placed on how the data and digital outputs can be accessed, mined, or reused?
> Belmont Forum policy is that the data should be as open as possible to commercial and non-commercial users, though with managed access where appropriate and necessary, for example, if there are sensitive data involving human subjects.
> 
>  - Preservation of Restrictions*:  	How will you ensure that any data security, privacy, and intellectual property restrictions associated with datasets and digital outputs will be honored and preserved in derivative products?
> 
>  - Documentation and Metadata for Reuse*:  	What supporting documentation and other information (e.g., metadata) do you plan to make publicly accessible to support the longer-term reuse of the data and digital outputs?
> 
>  - Long-Term Support Costs*:  	How have you accounted for the costs required to manage the data and digital outputs to ensure long-term accessibility?
> 
> My next question is this: I am putting together a task list of what is required of each PI on the project (there are about 12 PIs). What do I need from each of them to fill out these sections in accordance with the policies? E.g., I think I need to know their total estimated output data size, so I know how much I need to budget for long-term support costs.
**assistant**:
> To fill out the sections in accordance with the policies and gather the necessary information from each PI, you can request the following from each of them:
> 
> 1. **Policy Conformance**: Request information on how they plan to ensure that their data and digital outputs conform to the Belmont Forum Open Data Policy and Principles, the NSF policy, and the RNC (Norway) policy, as well as the FAIR principles.
> 
> 2. **Plan Personnel**: Ask each PI to identify the team member(s) who will be responsible for developing, implementing, overseeing, and updating the Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan. Ensure that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.
> 
> 3. **Output Protection**: Inquire about the data management practices during the project. Learn where the data will be held, who will have access to it, and if there is a specialized data manager on the project team. Clarify how the data will be protected to ensure its long-term value.
> 
> 4. **Post-Project Data Management**: Obtain information on how each PI plans to manage the data and other digital outputs after the project ends to ensure their long-term accessibility. Ask if they will publish the outputs with persistent, unique, and resolvable identifiers and if they will deposit them in recognized, trustworthy repositories or data centers. Consider asking for a timeline for this process.
> 
> 5. **Restrictions**: Discuss with each PI if they anticipate any restrictions on how the data and digital outputs can be accessed, mined, or reused. Emphasize the goal of openness while taking into account potential sensitivity of human subjects' data.
> 
> 6. **Preservation of Restrictions**: Seek their plans for honoring and preserving any data security, privacy, and intellectual property restrictions associated with datasets and digital outputs in derivative products.
> 
> 7. **Documentation and Metadata for Reuse**: Inquire about the type of supporting documentation and metadata they intend to make publicly accessible to support the longer-term reuse of the data and digital outputs.
> 
> 8. **Long-Term Support Costs**: Request estimated output data sizes from each PI so that you can determine the potential costs required to manage the data and digital outputs for long-term accessibility. This information will help inform the budget for long-term support.
> 
> Ensure that you provide clear instructions to each PI, explaining the purpose and importance of the information you are collecting and providing any relevant guidance or templates that they can use to streamline the process. Encourage collaboration and coordination among the PIs to ensure consistency and coherence in the overall Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan.
**user**:
> Finally, can you draft answers to each of the headings in the data management plan, such that it's clear that we will be following all of the policies? If there are particular points where I need to add in details I get from the PIs, please mark those as well.
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are draft responses for each of the headings in the Data Management Plan, emphasizing compliance with the policies:
> 
> **Policy Conformance**:
> The data and digital outputs from our project will conform to the Belmont Forum Open Data Policy and Principles, the NSF policy, the RNC (Norway) policy, and the FAIR principles. We will ensure that the data is discoverable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, and managed according to the specified data principles and policies. Compliance with these policies is integral to our project design, and we will actively adhere to the recommended standards and guidelines.
> 
> **Plan Personnel**:
> Member(s) of our team responsible for developing, implementing, overseeing, and updating the Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan include [Provide names and roles of responsible team members]. These team members will work collaboratively to ensure that the plan is well-conceived, organized, and aligned with the relevant policies. Clear roles and responsibilities will be assigned, and regular communication and coordination will be established to facilitate effective implementation.
> 
> **Output Protection**:
> To ensure the long-term value and protection of the data and digital outputs during the project, we will employ robust data management practices. The data will be stored in secure repositories at [Specify repository/ies or institution]. Access to the data will be granted to authorized project team members, and appropriate data security measures will be implemented to safeguard confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property. A specialized data manager will be designated to oversee the management and security aspects of the data.
> 
> **Post-Project Data Management**:
> After the project concludes, we will ensure the long-term accessibility of the data and other digital outputs. The outputs will be published with persistent, unique, and resolvable identifiers, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), which will facilitate easy citation and retrieval. We will deposit the data and digital outputs in recognized, trustworthy repositories or data centers, following the standards and guidelines outlined by resources such as re3data.org registry and CoreTrustSeal certified data repositories. This deposition will occur no later than [Specify the timeline based on project objectives and funding agency requirements].
> 
> **Restrictions**:
> We anticipate minimal restrictions on how the data and digital outputs can be accessed, mined, or reused. Our commitment is to foster openness and accessibility to both commercial and non-commercial users, while ensuring compliance with legal, ethical, and privacy considerations. Any potential restrictions will be carefully evaluated and implemented only where necessary, such as for sensitive data involving human subjects. We will handle such restrictions in accordance with ethical protocols, data protection regulations, and relevant policies.
> 
> **Preservation of Restrictions**:
> We are dedicated to respecting and preserving any data security, privacy, and intellectual property restrictions associated with the datasets and digital outputs. These restrictions will be documented clearly, and measures will be taken to ensure that derivative products honor and retain the original restrictions. We will follow appropriate licensing and usage agreements to ensure that the restrictions are communicated effectively to users and downstream data consumers.
> 
> **Documentation and Metadata for Reuse**:
> To support the longer-term reuse of the data and digital outputs, we will provide comprehensive supporting documentation and metadata. This will include detailed descriptions of the methodologies, data collection protocols, calibration procedures, and any relevant contextual information necessary for understanding and effectively utilizing the data. The metadata will follow international standards and will be made publicly accessible at no cost, allowing for easy search, discoverability, and integration with other datasets.
> 
> **Long-Term Support Costs**:
> We have estimated the long-term support costs required to manage the data and digital outputs for ensured accessibility throughout their lifecycle. The estimated costs consider factors such as storage, preservation, metadata maintenance, and repository fees. The total estimated output data size, as provided by the PIs, is [Include estimated output data size]. These cost estimates have been incorporated into our budget to ensure the availability of resources necessary for long-term support.
> 
> Please note that specific details and additional information required from the PIs (such as names of responsible team members, repository specifications, and timeline for deposition) should be incorporated into the draft responses. Additionally, it is essential to review and revise the responses, ensuring they accurately reflect the project's actual implementation and alignment with the policies and principles.
