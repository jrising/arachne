**user**:
> What is a "purchase order number"? I'm asked to fill out a template invoice to get an honorarium, and this is a field.
**assistant**:
> A purchase order number (often abbreviated as "PO number") is a unique identifier that businesses use to track orders placed with vendors or suppliers. 
> 
> When a business wants to buy something from a vendor, it sends a document called a purchase order, which details what is being ordered, the quantity, the agreed price, and other relevant specifics. This document is given a unique purchase order number for tracking and reference. 
> 
> When you're filling out an invoice and are asked for the "purchase order number," it's usually because the client or company who is paying you wants to match your invoice to the corresponding purchase order they issued. 
> 
> If you haven't been given a purchase order number or aren't sure what it is, it's best to reach out to the person or department who asked you to fill out the invoice for clarification. It's possible that if you're receiving an honorarium, the process might be handled a bit differently than conventional purchase orders and invoices.
