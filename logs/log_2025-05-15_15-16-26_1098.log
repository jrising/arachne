> The page provides an overview of the CASCADES project, a European Union-funded initiative that ran from September 2019 to December 2023. Coordinated by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research, the project involved twelve European partners focused on climate change, policy, trade, and stakeholder engagement. CASCADES generated over fifty deliverables, including policy briefs, journal articles, and various communication products like videos and podcasts. The publication includes strategic recommendations for European resilience to cascading climate risks. There is also a notable cover image of the 2011 flooding in Thailand, which had significant implications for global supply chains. Additionally, the EU flag is noted, symbolizing European unity. The report emphasizes the importance of adaptive and resilient societies in the face of climate impacts.
