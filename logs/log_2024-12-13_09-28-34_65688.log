> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> My name is Hadia Khan and I am a senior undergraduate at Rutgers University, majoring in Environmental Science. I am pursuing graduate school in hopes of shifting toward economics with a focus on environmental and climate issues to better prepare myself to contribute to policy solutions. I have taken law and economics courses and have experience with environmental analysis through multiple software, as well as research using satellite data for climate analyses. 
> 
> I am applying to the University of Delaware's Environmental Economics MS program and was looking into your area of specialty. I was very intrigued by your papers on estimating economic damages from climate change (2017) and the social cost of carbon for global energy consumption (2021). These expand on questions critical to climate policy and action. I also noticed that Dr. Robert Kopp from Rutgers also participated in them! I was wondering if you have any research opportunities should I be accepted into this program. I would love to learn about climate modeling and econometrics. I've attached my resume if you would like to know more about my background and experience. Thank you for your time.
