**user**:
> I'm finishing a hand written addendum to my Christmas letter for someone who loves puzzles and puns, writing "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and ...", and I want to end with an anagram of a pun. Do you have suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can help with that. Anagrams and puns can make a perfect linguistic mishmash. Here's a lovely phrase which is a pun. "Never odd or even." The phrase itself is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), and its anagram yields "Overdone end rev," also maintaining a wordplay feel. 
> 
> So, you could finish your sentence like this:
> 
> "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns, and overdone end revs!"
> 
> The 'revs' can metaphorically suggest the exciting turns and invigorations of the new year. It's a light, puzzling term that puzzle lovers often enjoy!
