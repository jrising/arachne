> I am trying to upgrade my php version to 8.2 for wordpress, but now I get an error from `wp-includes/class-wp-widget-factory.php`:
> ```
> PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught ArgumentCountError: Too few arguments to function WP_Widget::__construct(), 0 passed in /home/jrising/existencia/pro/wp-includes/class-wp-widget-factory.php on line 62 and at least 2 expected in /home/jrising/existencia/pro/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php:163
> ```
> I tried to wrap this in a try catch, as follows:
> ```
>     public function register( $widget ) {
>         if ( $widget instanceof WP_Widget ) {
>             $this->widgets[ spl_object_hash( $widget ) ] = $widget;
>         } else {
>             try	{
>             $this->widgets[ $widget ] = new $widget();
>             } catch (Exception $e) {
>             }
>         }
>     }
> ```
> The error is on the `$this->widgets[ $widget ] = new $widget();` which is now wrapped in a try-catch but I still get that uncaught error. How can that be?
**assistant**:
> The issue here is that the error being produced isn't an instance of the `Exception` class, but rather of the `ArgumentCountError` class, which is a subclass of `Error`, not `Exception`. As a result, it's not being caught by your try-catch block because it's not the type of error you're looking for. 
> 
> Starting from PHP 7, errors have been reclassified into two main categories: `Exception` and `Error`. `Error` is designed to handle critical errors, such as type declaration errors or argument count errors. So when the `ArgumentCountError` is thrown, it's not caught with `Exception`, hence why you're getting an uncaught error message.
> 
> To resolve this, you could change your catch statement to catch `ArgumentCountError` like this:
> 
> ```php
> try {
>     $this->widgets[ $widget ] = new $widget();
> } catch (ArgumentCountError $e) {
>     // Handle the error here
> }
> ```
> Or you could catch both `Exception` and `Error` types:
> 
> ```php
> try {
>     $this->widgets[ $widget ] = new $widget();
> } catch (Exception | Error $e) {
>     // Handle the error here
> }
> ```
> This will catch any errors or exceptions that are thrown by the code within the try block. Make sure to handle the error in a way that won't break your application.
> 
> Just focus that your real issue seems to be that the WP_Widget::__construct() requires at least 2 arguments but none are being given. You might want to look into why this is happening, as just catching the error and ignoring it may result in other issues down the road.
