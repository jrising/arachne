**user**:
> I have a graphic that shows the material stocks and flows of something. There's a large stock in the middle of soil (50 cm topsoil) of 40-50 Gt. 15 Mt /yr flows to the soil from a mineral stock (13 Gt total) and the atmosphere provides a flow of 0.4 - 2 Mt/yr. Photomass is at 0.6 Gt, zoomass is less (not labeled) but 15 Mt/yr flows from phytomass to zoomass. Very large reservoirs are at the bottom for the lithosphere and ocean. I think it might be nitrogen or phosphorus. What is this? 
**assistant**:
> Based on the stocks, flows and reservoirs you have described, the graphic is most likely depicting the Phosphorus cycle. 
> 
> Phosphorus is one of the essential nutrients for life, and it moves through the biosphere in a cycle that includes mineral stocks in soil, flows to and from the atmosphere, and accumulation in biotic mass, or "biomass" for short.
> 
> The numbers seem to correspond, particularly the relatively large flows from soil to plants (phytomass) and from plants to animals (zoomass), and smaller flows to the atmosphere. The large reservoirs in the lithosphere and ocean also fit the phosphorus cycle: phosphorus can accumulate in the lithosphere over geological timescales, and can also deposit into the ocean from soil runoff.
> 
> However, to confirm this, more specifics about the quantities and flows would help as these could equally represent key aspects of the nitrogen cycle. For example, the nitrogen cycle typically includes greater gaseous exchange with the atmosphere which would often be highlighted in illustrative material.
