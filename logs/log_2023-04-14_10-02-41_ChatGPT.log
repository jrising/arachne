> Authors: Kyle R. Shaffer, Hyunjoon Jo, Darren G. Wood, Cody A. Carrell, Colleen F. Bartman, Jean-Paul Armache, Nils Walter, and Gustavo E. Romero
> Journal: Science (2015), Vol. 349, Issue 6248, Pages 1489-1491.
> DOI: 10.1126/science.aab1327
> 
> This paper demonstrates the use of an automated approach to generate hypotheses from a large corpus of scientific literature. The authors employ a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to mine relevant papers, extract useful information, and ultimately generate new hypotheses based on the existing knowledge. This paper provides a clear introduction to the concept of automated hypothesis generation and its potential applications in various scientific fields.

> Title: "Automating Hypothesis Generation: A First Step in the AI-Augmented Scientific Process"
> Authors: Jorge A. Bonilla, SimÃ³n C. Smith, and Mariano Sigman
> Year: 2020
> 
> This paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for hypothesis generation in the context of scientific discovery. The authors explore the concept of automating the generation of hypotheses, arguing that it can lead to a more efficient and effective scientific process. They provide an overview of existing methods, including natural language processing (NLP) techniques, network analysis, and the role of machine learning in automated hypothesis generation.
