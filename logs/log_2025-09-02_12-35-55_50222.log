> To perform linear interpolation from a set of points in Julia, you can use the `Interpolations.jl` package, which provides a simple and efficient way to interpolate data. Here’s a step-by-step guide to linearly interpolate between a set of `(year, delay)` points:
> 
> 1. **Install the `Interpolations.jl` Package**: If you haven't already installed the package, you'll need to do so. You can install it using Julia's package manager.
> 
>    ```julia
>    using Pkg
>    Pkg.add("Interpolations")
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Import the Package**: Once installed, you need to import it into your environment.
> 
>    ```julia
>    using Interpolations
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Define Your Data Points**: Collect your data points into two vectors, one for the years and one for the corresponding delays.
> 
>    ```julia
>    years = [2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020] # example years
>    delays = [5, 10, 7, 15, 20]          # corresponding delay values
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Create the Interpolation Function**: You can create a linear interpolation object. Since your data is one-dimensional, you can use the linear interpolation type `Gridded`:
> 
>    ```julia
>    linear_interpolation = LinearInterpolation(years, delays, extrapolation_bc=Flat())
>    ```
> 
>    Alternatively, if you want to handle extrapolation differently, you can specify how values outside the range should be treated (e.g., using `Flat()`, `Line()`, or specifying a number to use for extrapolation).
> 
> 5. **Use the Interpolation Function**: You can now use the interpolation function to find interpolated values at any year within (or even outside, depending on your extrapolation choice) the range of your data.
> 
>    ```julia
>    interpolated_value = linear_interpolation(2008)  # Example year
>    ```
> 
> 6. **Example Code**: Here’s a complete example putting it all together:
> 
>    ```julia
>    using Interpolations
> 
>    # Define data points
>    years = [2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020]
>    delays = [5, 10, 7, 15, 20]
> 
>    # Create the linear interpolation object
>    linear_interpolation = LinearInterpolation(years, delays, extrapolation_bc=Flat())
> 
>    # Get interpolated value at a specific year
>    interpolated_value = linear_interpolation(2008)
>    println("Interpolated delay for 2008: $interpolated_value")
>    ```

> This should give you an interpolated value for any year within your data set’s range, using a straightforward linear interpolation approach. If you have any additional requirements or edge cases you are concerned about, feel free to let me know!
