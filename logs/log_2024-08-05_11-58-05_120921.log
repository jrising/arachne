> van you write a LOI to Invest in our future "Invest in Our Future will help strengthen communities across the country, creating more places where people are able to secure high-quality, well-paying jobs; have access to clean energy to power their homes and businesses; and benefit from government investments that foster positive community transformations.
> 
> Invest in Our Future endeavors to coordinate across philanthropy partners to strengthen efforts to identify areas in need of funding; provide grants to organizations helping underserved communities that need support accessing federal funding for clean energy; and ensure federal investments for clean energy are available for the next ten years." to fund this program of IMT's called community Climate shift? "Unjust policy and business practices separate us by race and income into unequally resourced communities, creating a cycle where some benefit greatly and others, primarily BIPOC and low-income communities, are greatly harmed. Those bearing the brunt of these systems also bear the increasing burden of climate disasters. For example, Black people are 40% more likely to live in areas with deaths related to extreme weather temperatures, and BIPOC communities breathe in 37% more nitrogen dioxide pollutants than white people.
> However, governments are committing to ambitious climate goals and unprecedented federal funding is moving to support sustainable buildings that protect residents from environmental hazards. How can we ensure that new policy solutions accelerate environmental justice for BIPOC and low-income communities and create equitable climate action across the country?
> 
> The solution is Community Climate Shift (CCS): a groundbreaking coalition designed to transform how communities and governments work together to ensure that new building performance policies and programs contribute to a Just Transition and reflect community priorities. Our work advances environmental and racial justice by:
> Facilitating community-driven policy making to increase civic engagement
> Driving improvements in buildings, which results in healthier indoor environments
> Generating economic impact by reducing energy burden and improving the cost of living
> Increasing community access to federal funding
> Co-led by the People’s Climate Innovation Center (PCIC) and the Institute for Market Transformation, CCS is a national initiative guided by a Steering Committee comprised of environmental justice and CBO representatives including Verde, POWER Interfaith, and the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance. Only through the power of our strong partnerships are we able to achieve our goals.
> In the next three years, Community Climate Shift will:
> Create or strengthen collaboration infrastructure between community and government partnerships to create lasting impacts for future policy design. Midwest locations include Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; St. Louis, MO; and Kansas City, MO.
> Drive creation and implementation of innovative policy that will not only reduce energy and carbon in the built environment, but also address climate resilience, energy grid impacts, occupant health, and job creation
> Support governments and communities to unlock millions in federal and philanthropic funding to resource the goals above by providing technical assistance, funder connections, and grants
> By 2040, Community Climate Shift, and our collective efforts in this work, will:
> Create better buildings for more than 40 million people
> Cumulatively invest $111 billion in buildings
> Cumulatively eliminate 567 MMT of CO2e

> Dear [Recipient's Name],
> 
> I am reaching out on behalf of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) and the Community Climate Shift (CCS) initiative, a groundbreaking collaboration designed to promote equitable climate actions across the United States. 
> 
> We believe in the mission of "Invest in Our Future"—to foster sustainable communities through high-quality employment opportunities, clean energy access, and transformative investments. We greatly align with your objective to strengthen underserved communities by ensuring their access to federal funds for clean-energy efforts. It is my hope to explore potential partnership opportunities with your organization in furthering these shared goals. 
> 
> The CCS initiative aims to rectify the ongoing socio-economic disparities perpetuated through unjust policy and business practices that differentiate communities based on race and income. Especially today, these underserved communities face the brunt of climatic disasters while also disproportionately bearing the burdens of pollutant exposure. Our alliance with the People’s Climate Innovation Center offers a strong foundation for advocacy, guided by a steering committee made up of leading representatives and organizations from environmental justice initiatives and community benefit organizations.
> 
> In the next few years, the CCS sets out to:
>   
> - Foster and strengthen collaborative infrastructure between community and government partnerships, to impact future policymaking positively.
> - Drive creation and implementation of innovative policy targeting not just carbon and energy reduction in the built environment, but also climate resilience, energy grid impacts, occupant health, and job creation.
> - Facilitating access to federal and philanthropic funding for governments and communities, supplying technical assistance, funder connections, and grants vital to the realization of these expectations.
> 
> We intend to make significant strides towards achieving these ends by 2040 with anticipated results as follows:
> 
> - Improved buildings for more than 40 million people
> - An estimated investment output of $111 billion in building improvements
> - Eliminating 567 MMT of CO2e through collective efforts
>   
> Our work has already proven to make significant strides in promoting environmental and racial justice within communities by facilitating community-driven policy changes, driving indoor environment improvements, stimulating community economies, and increasing community access to federal funding.
> 
> We kindly request your consideration for a financial investment in CCS and our endeavors. This collaboration provides an excellent opportunity for your organization to further its mission of community transformation through your philanthropic efforts.
> 
> We would be delighted to further discuss this proposal and provide you with any additional information required to make an informed decision. 
> 
> On behalf of the whole team at IMT and CCS, we are looking forward to potentially working together to achieve the common goal that drives us all — creating a sustainable and equitable future.
