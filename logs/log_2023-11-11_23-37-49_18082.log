> Hello Austin, houses are made from bricks because bricks are strong and can last a very long time. They also help to keep the inside of the house warm in winter and cool in summer. Isn't that neat? Speaking of strong things, did you know that dragons in stories are often described as being as strong as mountains? If you could be a dragon, what would be your super-strong power?

> If I could be a dragon, my super-strong power would be the ability to create and control fire. I would use it to keep warm in cold places, cook my favorite food instantly, and maybe even light up dark places like a torch. Plus, it would be pretty cool to have a fiery breath! What about you, James? If you could be a dragon, what super-strong power would you choose?

> If I could be a dragon, my super-strong power would be the ability to fly. Imagine soaring through the sky, feeling the wind rush past you, and experiencing a sense of freedom and exhilaration. I would use my flying ability to explore new places, visit distant lands, and gain a unique perspective on the world. It would be an amazing way to travel and discover the beauty of our planet.
