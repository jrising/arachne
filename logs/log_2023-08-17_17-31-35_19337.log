> Here is a description of Wave Energy:
> ---
> Wave power is the capture of energy of wind waves to do useful work – for example, electricity generation, water desalination, or pumping water. A machine that exploits wave power is a wave energy converter (WEC).
> 
> Waves are generated by wind passing over the sea's surface. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above, energy is transferred from the wind to the waves. Air pressure differences between the windward and leeward sides of a wave crest and surface friction from the wind cause shear stress and wave growth.[1]
> 
> Wave power is distinct from tidal power, which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. Other forces can create currents, including breaking waves, wind, the Coriolis effect, cabbeling, and temperature and salinity differences.
> 
> As of 2022, wave power is not widely employed for commercial applications, after a long series of trial projects. Attempts to use this energy began in 1890 or earlier,[2] mainly due to its high power density. Just below the ocean's water surface the wave energy flow, in time-average, is typically five times denser than the wind energy flow 20 m above the sea surface, and 10 to 30 times denser than the solar energy flow.[3]

> In 2000 the world's first commercial wave power device, the Islay LIMPET was installed on the coast of Islay in Scotland and connected to the UK national grid.[4] In 2008, the first experimental multi-generator wave farm was opened in Portugal at the Aguçadoura wave park.[5] Both projects have since ended.

> overtopping devices (with low-head hydraulic turbine)

> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters. Please write a paragraph about wind energy that mentions the following:
>  - There is only one marine hydrokinetic leases and planning area in the US, the PacWave research lease in Oregon.
>  - The region does not provide very high levels of wave energy potential, but the potential levelized cost may be low enough for even low-potential areas to be used. For example, a UK-based company has developed a Waveline Magnet that can achieve a levelized cost of electricity of £0.01/kWh with minimal levels of maintenance.
>  - Wave energies reach above 7 kW/m

> Wave energy refers to the capture of energy from wind waves to perform useful work, including electricity generation, water desalination, or water pumping. The concept involves utilizing a significant yet underexploited source of renewable energy to achieve sustainability aims. In the US, the implementation of this concept in actuality is still sparse with just one marine hydrokinetic lease and planning area, headed by PacWave in Oregon. Delaware, on the other hand, is a region that does not provide high levels of wave energy potential, but its potential levelized cost might be low enough to outbalance this restriction. The Waveline Magnet, developed by a UK-based company, stands testament to this concept, boasting a levelized cost of electricity as low as £0.01/kWh while demanding minuscule levels of maintenance. Indeed, wave energy holds great potential, with some areas even recording wave energy levels surpassing 7 kW/m. As such, while Delaware may not have very high wave energy potential, the cost-effective and sustainable use of even low potentials could pave the way to a renewable future.
