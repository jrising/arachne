> Can you use this information to suggest some researchers who would be good reviewers?
**assistant**:
> For your proposal on food security and health in the United States, it's essential to find reviewers who have expertise in the intersection of agriculture, nutrition, food policy, and environment, ideally with a focus on the U.S. Despite the references primarily focusing on West Africa, the thematic overlap in food systems, sustainability, agriculture productivity amidst environmental challenges, nutrition, and policy can guide us toward relevant expertise. Here are some suggested researchers based on allied research fields, who could provide valuable feedback on your proposal:
> 
> 1. **Shankar, B.** - Given his expertise in global dietary quality, undernutrition, and non-communicable diseases with a strong modeling background, Dr. Shankar could offer insights into the nutritional and health aspects of food security.
> 
> 2. **Allison, Edward H.** - With a focus on the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and fisheries-dependent societies, Dr. Allison can contribute comprehensive reviews on the environmental and climate dimensions of food security, especially relevant to the fisheries component if applicable to your U.S. context.
> 
> 3. **Golden, Christopher D.** - Dr. Golden’s work on aquatic foods, nutrition, and the sustainability of food systems would be particularly relevant for reviewing sections of your proposal that tie food security to health outcomes and environmental sustainability.
> 
> 4. **Pinsky, Malin L.** - An expert on marine ecology and the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries, Dr. Pinsky's insights would be valuable if your proposal touches on climate change, fisheries, and aquatic food sources in the U.S.
> 
> 5. **Barrett, Christopher B.** - Focused on food policy, agricultural development, and food security, particularly in relation to economic analysis and policy implications, Dr. Barrett could provide a critical review of the policy and socio-economic dimensions of your proposal.
> 
> 6. **Shepon, Alon** - With a background in the environmental impact of food production, particularly on meat and aquatic foods, Dr. Shepon could offer insights into the environmental health aspects of food security and dietary choices in the U.S.
> 
> 7. **Webb, Patrick** - Specializing in global nutrition, food policy, and the socio-political aspects of food security, Dr. Webb could contribute a broad, global perspective with specific insights into health and nutritional outcomes of food security interventions.
> 
> 8. **Micheli, Fiorenza** - Dr. Micheli’s expertise in marine ecology, conservation, and resource management in the face of climate change could be particularly useful for understanding the ecological and environmental health aspects of your proposal.
> 
> When suggesting reviewers, consider their current research focus to ensure it aligns with your proposal's core themes, particularly how they may pertain to the U.S. context of food security and health. Additionally, reaching out to researchers from interdisciplinary backgrounds can enrich the review process, providing diverse perspectives on the complex issue of food security.
