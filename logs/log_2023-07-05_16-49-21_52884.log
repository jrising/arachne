> 1. Professional development
> My fascination with the marine environment started after a trip to the Shedd
> Aquarium in Chicago when I was a child. From that point on I attempted to expand my
> knowledge base as best possible. I received a Bachelor of Science in marine science and
> general biology with a concentration in environmental chemistry from the University of
> Tampa in 2005. I completed a Ph.D. in marine science from James Cook University in 2012
> under the supervision of Dr. Philip Munday, with co-advisement from Drs. Morgan
> Pratchett and Geoffrey Jones. At graduation I was awarded the President’s medal and my
> thesis was given a cum laude distinction, indicating it was in the top 1% of theses awarded
> by the university. Prior to graduation, I began a two-year postdoctoral appointment in the
> Hay lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I remained at Georgia Tech for two years as
> an Assistant Professor, before transitioning to the University of Delaware in 2015.
> In this statement, I will detail an introduction to the main focus of my research
> objectives (section 1.1), and my research achievements (section 1.2), current work and
> future directions (section 1.3), teaching (section 2), service (3) and conclude with a short
> closing statement (section 4).
> 1.1. Introduction
> Human impact on the environment has escalated to the point of creating a new era,
> the Anthropocene. All of earth’s ecosystems have been, and are affected by the changing
> conditions, with oceans being no exception. The overarching goal of my research program
> is to investigate the effect anthropogenic-induced change has on the behavior of marine
> organisms; in particular I seek to understand behavioral processes that are driven by the
> chemosensory system. I explore behavioral ecology in marine systems using a combination
> of chemistry, ecology, and marine conservation biology skills. My ultimate goal is a holistic
> understanding of the changes to a variety of behavioral processes such as larval
> development, marine connectivity, recruitment/settlement, habitat selection and predatorprey
> interactions. The majority of my research focuses on the tropical coral reefs of Fiji,
> Australia, Papua New Guinea, Belize and Florida, and I have begun to expand my interest to
> include the temperate system within the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. In the temperate
> system, I seek to apply the concepts learned in tropical ecosystems, focusing thus far on the
> role chemical cues play in habitat selection, and the development of early life history
> stages. I work in collaborative groups to facilitate access to remote locations and answer
> broad questions approached from different scientific angles. My work is published in high
> impact scientific journals, is funded through multiple agencies and has been cited over
> 3,700 times. My publications are numbered throughout the following sections based on my
> CV, with increasing numbers indicating earlier work.

> After three years as an assistant professor at the University of Delaware (UD), in September of 2016, I joined the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs (SMEA) at the University of Washington (UW). I bring expertise in economics to SMEA, which is an interdisciplinary unit with 11 core faculty representing a diversity of disciplinary fields relevant to marine and environmental policy, including political science, anthropology, ecology, economics, and law. The Master’s degree program offered by SMEA trains students to apply interdisciplinary thinking to environmental problems. The School values interdisciplinary and policy-relevant research that serves a broad community of resource users and managers.
> During my four years at the University of Washington I have published my research in a number of disciplinary and interdisciplinary academic journals, secured funding to advance my research, and presented my research findings at several national and international conferences. I have also trained students and engaged in service to SMEA, the University, the field of natural resource and environmental economics, and to resource managers.
> My research is broadly focused on the economics of natural resources and the environment. There are three interconnected themes to my research program: (1) investments in common pool resources; (2) seafood markets; and (3) renewable resource management. These themes are critical to understanding resource sustainability and the societal impacts of resource management and en- vironmental change. Included in this dossier is a research statement where I highlight my scholarly contributions and describe my future research trajectory. Also included are descriptions of my contributions in the areas of teaching and service.

> Since joining the University of Delaware (UD) in August of 2015, I have dedicated myself to becoming a productive researcher, an effective instructor and advisor, and an engaged member of my academic home at UD as well as the applied economics profession broadly.
> In the past five years, I have developed an active, externally funded research program. The core of my research program examines how productive agricultural landscapes can be sustainably managed to improve environmental outcomes, with a focus on improving water quality. Much of my work aims to inform the design of cost-effective agri-environmental policies and programs. I use a variety of research methods to analyze decision making in different policy settings, including economic experiments in the laboratory and the field, mixed- mode surveys, mathematical programming and simulations. I have published 13 papers in journals including the American Journal of Agricultural Economics (2), Environmental and Resource Economics (2), Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, Resource and Energy Economics, and Economic Inquiry. To conduct this research, I helped to raise over $2,250,000 in grant funding as a PI or Co-PI, and I am the Social Dimensions Co-Lead of a $23 million National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR award, of which $2.3 million is awarded to the Social Dimensions team. Moving forward,
> Educating and mentoring students is a rewarding part of my job. Since joining UD, I have taught three undergraduate courses, one graduate course, and one graduate independent study course. I’ve also enjoyed guest lecturing for courses outside of my department. My teaching philosophy is grounded in a belief that students are motivated by a professor’s passion for the subject she teaches, as well as her willingness to connect with students and learn from their perspectives and experiences. I use lectures coupled with interactive learning activities that encourage critical thinking, reflection, and questioning. I also frequently share stories and use current events to connect with students and bring economics to life.
> As the grateful recipient of tremendous professional mentorship, I am dedicated to mentoring the next generation of applied economists and giving back through professional service. I have served as the lead research advisor for eight M.S. students in Agricultural and Resource Economics and seven undergraduate students participating in research internships and/or completing undergraduate theses. I have also served as a thesis committee member for an additional ten M.S. and Ph.D. students in a variety of departments and one undergraduate student in Natural Resource Management.
> I am currently the Associate Director of UD’s Center for Experimental and Applied Economics (CEAE). Our center’s mission is to nurture a community engaged in evidence-based research and dissemination of results to inform policy and promote sustainability at the nexus of agriculture and the environment. In any given semester, there are about 30 faculty, postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate researchers across the university who are actively engaged with CEAE. In addition to creating an environment that facilitates high-quality research, I have led the establishment of a layered mentorship program for CEAE students and postdocs. Within the department, college, and university, I have served on numerous committees, including four years spent as the chair of our departmental seminar committee. Beyond my university home, I strive to serve the broader agricultural economics community. I currently serve as an associate editor for the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, a member of the editorial council for the Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Past-Chair of AAEA’s Land, Water, and Environmental Economics Section, and a member of NAREA’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee. I am also a proud former chair of AAEA’s Committee on Women in Agricultural Economics.
> In this document, I will outline my accomplishments in the areas of scholarship, teaching, advising, leadership, and service. Additional evidential materials for each of these areas are provided in section III of my promotion and tenure dossier.

> This statement describes my research, teaching, and service activities since finishing my PhD in 2015. In this time I was a post-doctoral fellow at University of California Berkeley for 9 months from 2015-2016 and since then have been an Assistant Professor at the University of California Davis. 
> Since finishing my PhD in September 2015 I have developed a research program that bridges climate science and environmental economics in order to better characterize and quantify the costs of climate change. I have published 18 peer reviewed journal articles since my PhD, including ones that have appeared in high-impact science journals (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Climate Change, Environmental Research Letters) and top agricultural and environmental economics journals (American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy) and successfully obtained grant funding from the National Science Foundation (one award of $750,000 as lead-PI, one of $2.8 million as co-PI). Recognition of my research accomplishments includes 28 invited talks at conferences or departmental seminars. My undergraduate and graduate teaching, across 5 different classes, focuses on building general skills in quantitative analysis and accessible, applied instruction in environmental policy analysis. I mentor graduate students in multiple graduate groups and have contributed to the establishment of a new graduate program in Environmental Policy and Management. I work to communicate my work on climate change costs to the public and policy makers through public speaking events, op-ed and policy brief writing, and consultation with federal agencies.
