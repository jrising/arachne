> Sure, I can propose a mapping based on the provided lists. Considering the disciplinary variations, there are some which align more directly than others.

> The purpose of this mapping is to align the disciplines stated in the CVs to the closest disciplinary categories listed in the survey of earned doctorates. Since some of the disciplines in CV are rather unique or interdisciplinary, I have tried to map them to the closest related disciplines within the set structure provided by the survey data. It should be noted, however, that user discretion and expert judgment could modify these mappings. For any division within the CV disciplines that does not have an obvious direct counterpart in the doctorate survey disciplines, multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary sciences could be considered the default go-to.
