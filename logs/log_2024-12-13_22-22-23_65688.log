**assistant**:
> To extract a multiline block of text that is enclosed between triple backticks (` ``` `) in a Python string, you can use regular expressions. The `re` module in Python is designed for such tasks. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:
> 
> ```python
> import re
> 
> def extract_code_block(text):
>     # This regular expression looks for text between two sets of ``` markers
>     pattern = r'```(.*?)```'
>     # re.DOTALL allows '.' to match newline characters, enabling multiline extraction
>     matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
>     return matches
> 
> # Example usage
> text = """
> Here is some text.
> 
> ```
> This is a block of code
> that spans multiple lines.
> ```
> 
> And here is some more text.
> 
> ```
> Another block of code.
> ```
> """
> 
> code_blocks = extract_code_block(text)
> for i, block in enumerate(code_blocks, start=1):
>     print(f"Code block {i}:\n{block}\n")
> ```
> 
> In this code, `re.findall()` returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, giving you a list of code blocks. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the `.` character to match newlines, so the regex can capture the entire multiline block of text. Each matched block of text will be an element in the `matches` list.
