**user**:
> That makes sense if the object is a type itself. But what if the object is an instance of a type?
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the confusion. To check if an object is an instance of a given type in Julia, you can use the `isa()` function.

> The `isa()` function takes two arguments: an object and a type. It returns `true` if the object is an instance of the type, and `false` otherwise.
