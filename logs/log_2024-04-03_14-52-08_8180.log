> 	In many cases, qualitative assessments are associated with quantified biophysical risks across future periods and scenarios. This information is important for understanding the qualitative emergence of risks. While the qualitative entries in the chapter summary tables ignore the scenario and period column headers (e.g., Table 5-1), in many cases quantitative biophysical information is available to distinguish between these.
> Ch. 5, lines 125 - 129	Adaptation information is generally missing from the qualitative sections. However, the absence of quantified economic values typically does not mean that there is a lack of knowledge on adaptation options. The erosion qualitative section is one of the few that has adaptation information (4 lines), but it suggests that practices to reduce erosion are infeasible and (with its conflated discussion of agricultural runoff) practices to reduce runoff are experimental. This is very odd: cover crops and no-till agriculture are in wide use to reduce erosion; and wetland buffers are very effective to reduce input contimination.
> Ch. 3, lines 356 – 365	It is not clarified that Ashenfelter and Storchmann (2016) apparently do not discuss New York or the region.
> Ch. 3, lines 389 - 400	While the total effect on wine production for New York is not clear, this section provides an assessment which seems qualitatively at odds with the evidence. New York is at the upper edge of wine suitability in the US, and climate change is expected to increase its suitability (e.g., White et al. 2006 shows it as one of the few remaining suitable regions, under a high-emissions A2 scenario at end of century). Given the provided evidence, wine production in New York is likely a growth opportunity.
> Ch. 3, Table 3-11	Extreme storms would similarly affect wine, other crops, and livestock, but are not mentioned qualitatively except for apples.
> Ch. 3, lines 548, 556	When older studies use older emissions scenarios, which are also simulated using older GCMs, the results need to be translated or explained in terms of the warming levels found by those models under those scenarios. This should also be done for all scenarios and models outside of the core set used in the report.
> Ch. 3, lines 586 - 589	Given that important pressures are excluded, why is the estimated $3.6m loss offered as an upper limit?
> Ch. 5, lines 87 - 88	While the authors correctly cite a statement made by Segura et al. here, I believe it is incorrect. Non-point pollution from agricultural runoff is the leading source of water quality problems, but that is not necessarily connected with any erosion. The discussion here also conflates the health effects associated with other agriculture-related pollutants with the water effects associated with soil erosion (largely turbidity). 
> Ch. 8, lines 631 - 639	It is not clear what component of the costs discussed by Hanson & Nicholls are climate-driven. Further demand for ports and port area could be driven entirely by increases in trade.
> Ch. 8, Table 8-15	It should be clarified whether the modeling assumptions used in Strzepek et al. match the modeling assumptions used in this assessment. The use of the same table structure suggests that they do. If so, these should just be treated as quantified results.

**assistant**:
> Given the structure and content of the economic assessment, and reflecting on your previous comments, my suggestions revolve around analyzing the adequacy and depth of the assessment, particularly in terms of quantification of impacts, integration of adaptive strategies, and the precision of modeling assumptions. Here are some comments that could align with your approach:
> 
> ### 1. Cognition and Learning Impacts (Qualitative Damages)
> 
> "In the qualitative assessment of cognition and learning impacts, the report relies heavily on existing studies to predict the adverse effects of high ambient temperatures on learning and cognitive functions. While it provides a comprehensive overview of the literature, there is a notable absence of localized data or studies directly correlating such impacts within New York State. Additionally, while the report mentions adaptation measures like air conditioning to mitigate heat impacts, it falls short of discussing the economic feasibility or the potential for statewide implementation plans to address these impacts. A more critical analysis of adaptation costs and strategies, similar to the approach taken in analyzing erosion control measures, would enhance the comprehensiveness of this section."
> 
> ### 2. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)
> 
> "The discussion on HABs focuses predominantly on the biophysical and health impacts, with less emphasis on the economic implications of these events across the state. Given the significant recreational and water use interests in New York, an economic quantification of lost recreational revenues, water treatment costs, and potential impacts on property values in affected areas would provide a more complete picture. Moreover, the section could benefit from integrating successful case studies or adaptation strategies employed in other states or regions to manage HAB risks, thus moving beyond a mere qualitative review."
> 
> ### 3. Food Safety
> 
> "Although the report does a commendable job in drawing connections between climate change and food safety risks, the economic assessment could be expanded to cover the broader economic implications for the state's food industry, including agriculture, retail, and hospitality sectors. The discussion on power outages and food safety provides an avenue to explore the economic benefits of investing in resilient energy infrastructure or alternative cooling technologies to safeguard food safety in the event of power failures. This ties back to the need for a more nuanced discussion of adaptation options and their costs, which seems to be a recurring theme across different sections."
> 
> ### 4. Health Effects of Power Outages and Extreme Events
> 
> "While the report effectively outlines the health and safety risks associated with power outages and extreme weather events, it could further quantify the economic impacts of these disruptions on healthcare delivery, emergency services, and overall productivity losses. Additionally, exploring the cost-effectiveness of various adaptation and resilience-building measures, such as enhancing grid infrastructure or implementing advanced weather prediction technologies, would provide valuable insights into the trade-offs and benefits of different adaptation strategies."
> 
> ### 5. Wildfires
> 
> "The assessment of wildfire impacts primarily focuses on health and ecological damages, with less emphasis on the economic dimensions of increased wildfire activity in the state. An in-depth analysis of the potential costs associated with forest management practices, firefighting efforts, property losses, and the impact on tourism and outdoor recreation industries would offer a more holistic view of the economic implications of wildfires. Furthermore, the discussion could benefit from an examination of innovative fire management and risk reduction practices being implemented in other regions with similar climate change-induced fire risks."
> 
> Overall, these comments suggest that while the report provides a solid foundation, there is room for deeper analysis in quantifying economic impacts and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of adaptation measures. Incorporating these elements would align with your comprehensive and critical approach to assessing the economic impacts of climate change in New York State.
