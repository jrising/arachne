> Failing to account for these confounding factors misrepresents the
> impacts of extreme temperatures and the potential for future adaptation. Poor weather can both reduce yields and kill plants. For both annuals and perennials, farmers can respond to these environmental shocks with both short-term, intensive, and long-term, extensive management decisions. The effects of actions taken after observing a shock but before production outcomes are generally hidden to {\it ex post} statistical methods.
> 
> This paper focuses on two hidden management decisions: selective harvesting and responses to die-off. Farmers can selectively harvest their most productive fields, reducing harvested area relative to planted area and boosting apparent yields. For example, fields that experienced die-off will not be harvested. Selective harvesting applies to both annual and perennial crops. However, die-off for perennials has multi-year consequences and demands new investment. Farmer decisions around new planting, removal of older, less-productive trees, and abandonment are hidden but affect the biophysical yield of an area.
> 
> Underlying this investigation is a pervasive data problem in national agricultural statistics. An accurate accounting of crop yields requires data on area planted, since harvested area hides the effects of selective harvest and die-off. However, a review of all crops reported by the US and Brazilian statistical agencies shows that planted area for perennial crops is universally unavailable in annual surveys (although it is reported in the US Census of Agriculture). While area of mature perennials is reported for many crops, there is strong evidence that it is unreliable in both countries (see appendix \ref{sec:othercrops}). For annual crops, planted area is unavailable in many countries and there is evidence that reported planted area in Brazil is actually harvested area for many crops and observations. The consequences of calculating yields using this information are elaborated in section \ref{sec:yieldcalcs}.
> 
> Coffee production in Hawaii provides a useful case study of showing both the challenges with perennial crop data and evidence of selective harvesting, for a comparatively well-reported region (see appendix \ref{sec:hawaii}). Combining data from the USDA's annual survey and the Census of Agriculture, between 1997 and 2022, harvested, planted, and bearing (mature tree) areas are only all available in four years. Bearing area is reported as equal to harvested area in years when the annual survey reports both (2013 - 2016) but an average of 9.4\% higher than harvested area across the available Census years (2002, 2007, and 2012). The portion of planted or bearing area that is harvested declines with high temperatures. That is, even for the US, perennial crop data is sparse and misreported, but shows evidence that damaging temperatures cause selective harvesting.

> There is overwhelming evidence that the risks and impacts from rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are very significant, will impact nearly every aspect of human life and the environment, and could ultimately prove to be devastating. An apparent incongruity exists between the pervasiveness of anticipated physical changes and the relatively modest total losses often estimated in economic evaluations \cite{stern2013structure, dellink2019sectoral}. Part of the explanation for this mismatch comes from  ``missing risks'': the risks associated with physical and social processes and interactions that are not currently included in economic evaluations, either because of their uncertainty, our limited understanding of them, or because existing economic models do not capture them in sufficient detail.
> 
> The interplay within and between different physical and social systems plays a crucial role in defining when and where impacts will manifest themselves and these interactions are often only poorly understood. The uncertainties multiply as critical thresholds are exceeded resulting in a variety of tipping points, regional temperatures changes, sea level rise, or the degradation of particular ecosystems, and a cascade of risks. The nonlinear interactions within the combined physical/social system under climate change thus leads to a wide range of incompletely understood and underestimated risks \cite{simpson2021framework}. For example, the potential for climate change impacts to drive social discontent, dislocation and relocation, and instability and conflict, are all deeply uncertain, but potentially crippling. 
> 
> Excluding these risks from economic assessments is equivalent to placing a probability of zero upon their occurrence. This, clearly, is not the case. Similarly, the common practice of engaging only with the expected levels of impacts and reporting central confidence bounds can undermine the ability of decision-makers to engage with the actual distribution of risk. The overall consequence is an underestimation of the total risks of climate change. This paper aims to identify, classify, and suggest ways to engage with some of the most significant risks that are not currently captured by socioeconomic evaluations of climate change, from both a natural and social perspective. As an example of how this can be achieved we present a demonstration of how diverse impact estimates or assumptions can be coherently combined.
> 
> \section{Background} % 1250 -> 750 % DAVID
> 
> Economic evaluations of the risks of climate change are a crucial input into policy-making and long-term planning processes for businesses and communities. Projects like the American Climate Prospectus \cite{houser2015economic} and European PESETA projects \cite{ciscar2018climate} have produced high-resolution projections of the costs of climate impacts (damages) across many sectors, while Benefit-Cost Integrated Assessment Models (BC-IAMs) produce global estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) \cite{weyant2020some}. When comparing the costs of mitigation to climate damages, it is crucial to account for all substantive risks to human society and aspects of the natural world that we value.
> Economic evaluation is intended to do this, by studying changes to comprehensive measures of welfare. In particular, a full economic evaluation goes far beyond financial risks. It includes not only losses to aggregated GDP but also the effect for individual groups and consequences for inequality. It also includes ``non-market'' losses, such as losses to ecosystems and broader human well-being.
> 
> However, many existing evaluations and the models that support them fall short of this ideal. Economists often contribute to the confusion between economic and financial losses by reporting both market and non-market losses in terms of money or as a percent of GDP. This translation from physical losses to money-equivalent welfare (``valuation'') requires a number of assumptions, which can be opaque. For example, the financial loss resulting from increased death rates from business-as-usual climate change in the US is less than 1\% of GDP by 2050, but a median estimated welfare loss is 5\% \cite{houser2015economic}.
> 
> In the context of climate change, ``risks'' are uncertain but potentially damaging changes which are attributable to the consequences of increased radiative forcing driven by the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The aim in quantifying a climate risk is usually to produce a probability distribution of possible impacts in quantities such as meters of sea-level rise, decreased biodiversity index, people affected by a type of event, or percent losses to GDP. Anthropogenic climate change, however, takes the climate/social system into a regime never before experienced, so demonstrably robust, reliable probabilities are rarely a possibility \cite{stainforth2007confidence, frigg2015assessment, smith2002might}. Nevertheless such distributions, or even just scientifically founded rough estimates of such distributions, are valuable for illuminating the characteristics of the integrated complexities of the economic impacts of climate change. Even where no credible quantifications exist for a particular risk, we might still be able to define a sensible approach to such an assessment and set limits on credible estimates. For example, one can ask how many additional people live in extreme poverty today due to existing climate change (a quantification of poverty risk), but robust estimates are still lacking. The detailed quantification process itself is not necessary in many cases for policy-makers to engage with risks.
> 
> Throughout this paper, we frame the term ``engaging with risks'' to encompass the various steps necessary to incorporate currently missing risks into policy-making. With respect to economic models, engagement is facilitated by improving the representation of phenomena within them and capturing the interactions and feedbacks with other systems. The distributions of impacts produced by such models are often taken as probability distributions, but in the context of multi-decadal climate change they suffer from deep uncertainties \cite{stainforth2007confidence, stainforth2007issues}. Therefore, for both modelled and non-modelled risks, alternatives to modeling approaches must also be considered. While models can support policy engagement, models outputs are insufficient to provide all necessary information to facilitate engagement with many risks. In addition, it is essential to transparently highlight missing risks in economic evaluations and provide narrative descriptions of the consequences of the omission. It is important to be aware of the diverse range of risks associated with climate change even when no quantifications exist or they 
> suffer from deep uncertainties.
> 
> The full range of risks from climate change is currently missing from economic evaluations and there are two broad reasons for these omissions. First, a considerable time delay exists between natural system understanding of physical risks, economic understanding of the implications of these risks and their nonlinear social feedbacks, and incorporation of this understanding into economic models and comprehensive analyses. Second, high levels of uncertainty and incomplete understanding of physical processes drive scientists to be conservative in reporting them, or drive them to focus on central estimates.
> 
> To unpack this second reason, it is helpful to distinguish five kinds of uncertainty which factor into economic impact uncertainty (see table \ref{tbl:uncertainty} for a summary).

> Austin is long for Au and short for Augustine, which comes from Augustus. Austin is most associated with the capital of Texas, "the Athens of the South", and while we do not feel any strong connection with the city, it is notable as a center of cultural fusion: a blue city in a red state, and a mixing ground for Mexican and American culture. Perhaps we liked the name so much because you were born after three years of living in London, feeling a bit like a cultural dissonance ourselves and missing home. I also like that your name comes from a saint who is best known for his sins.
> 
> You are named after the chemical symbol for gold, Au (☉), the most versatile of the metals, in honor of your great-grandmother, Goldie Newman. Goldie was a center and matriarch of the Newman family, and we would come to her house for Passover and Thanksgiving every year, no matter where we lived. She was a lover of learning and books, and all the family's children. Goldie died on May 17, 2020, aged 96, just a month before you were born.
> 
> Augustus was an honorific given to the Roman emperors, a sign of respect and a recognition of greatness along with their violet cloak. Like those emperors, we recognize the greatness in you, no matter what you choose to do with it. It is our small act of abolition against the couriers of Kafka.
> 
> Paz (פָּז) is your Hebrew name, and it also means golden. As a Jew, you receive a second name directly from the Torah as it was written over 2500 years ago, and "all of Zion's fountains are in you" (Psalm 87 (פז)). The word is used in Proverb 8, where the fruits of wisdom are said to be finer than gold. My own search for wisdom has meant so much to me that I hope you will agree. Another meaning of פָּז is "puzzles", which we will let you puzzle out for yourself.
> 
> We also like Paz because it means "peace" in Spanish. In the Lutheran church, the church of your father's family, our greeting is to say, "Peace be with you." Long before your mother and I met, I felt an affinity for this name through the character of Professor Bernardo de la Paz, a revolutionary who lived on the moon.
> 
> Reed was your biological grandfather's middle name, and his maternal grandfather’s before him. Your biological grandfather was a man who loved nature and loved Science Fiction. I think he would have appreciated passing on a bit of the natural world in his name, for a plant that lives in the swamps but reaches for the stars.
> 
> Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635. His name was James, like mine. The name "Rising" probably comes from the land around Castle Rising in Norfolk, England, which we took you to while you were in the womb, and that name goes back to the Domesday Book. Its most famous inhabitant, Queen Isabella, was a great leader who brought peace to England and Scotland, though it took a revolution to do it. While Isabella loved her crown of gold, we hope you love your name after the City of the Violet Crown.

> Agriculture is going to be one of the sectors most disrupted by climate change. Our ability to produce food relies on a stable climate. Crops and management practices are carefully catered to local climate conditions, including the timing and intensity of rainfall, the length of growing seasons, and the complex biology of soil. Climate change is going to disrupt all of this, demanding new practices, new varietals, and for many regions, new sources of water or arable land.
> 
> Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers.
> 
> One piece of evidence comes from following the harmful effect of high temperatures on crops in the United States. Temperatures over 29 °C damage corn (maize), but this effect can be attenuated by irrigation. As a result, the damaging effect of high temperatures is observed to be much less in the extensively-irrigated US West than in the East. It has also been observed that the impact of high temperatures has slowly declined over the course of the historical yield record, from 1950 onward (Burke & Emerick, 2013). This is climate adaptation occurring as we watch!
> 
> So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years. We modeled this effect across the next century, and whereas climate change would reduce yields by almost 60% by the end of the century (under business-as-usual), adaptation results in yields only being reduced by about 50%.
> 
> 
> The loss in yields from climate change, with adaptation (solid) or without (dashed).
> Clearly adaptation in the past cannot be a blueprint for adaptation in the future.
> 
> One of the most common stories about agriculture in the US is that it will just move north. If it’s too hot here, it will be just right in Canada. That will be bad for US farmers, but certainly not an existential threat to our ability to feed people in the future. But can agriculture find as fertile grounds north?
> 
> To answer this, I collaborated with Naresh Devineni, a hydrologist and Bayesian modeler. We developed a new model of the sensitivity of crops in the US to climate change, and a way to project crop switching into the future. The paper was recently published in Nature Communications.
> 
> The results suggest caution. Can crop-switching reduce the impacts of climate change? Yes, but 50% of the losses from climate change cannot be adapted away. Will many farmers have to change what they grow? A ton: To get the benefits we describe, over 50% of farmers will have to change what they grow.
> 
> Why can’t crop-switching remove all of the impacts of climate change? Almost everywhere, the value of the land for planting any of the crops we model will fall. In fact, in our model about 5% of current agricultural land will be left fallow by 2070, because any crop will cost more than it would generate in profit.

> **General Features of Your Voice**
> 
> 1. **Structured and Organized**: Your organization is apparent in this section from your blog entry, where you carefully lay out your question, your method, and your results: *"Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."*

> 
> 2. **Personal Letters**: Your use of rich, descriptive language and personal storytelling comes to life in this segment of your personal letter: *"You are named after the chemical symbol for gold, Au (☉), the most versatile of the metals, in honor of your great-grandmother, Goldie Newman..."*
> 
> 3. **Blogs for the Public**: Your explanatory style for a public audience is apparent in this section of your blog post: *"Agriculture is going to be one of the sectors most disrupted by climate change.
