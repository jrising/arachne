**user**:
> In excel, I have a column that contains multiple lines. I would like to turn this into several columns, one for each line. How can I do this with formulas?
**assistant**:
> You can use Excel functions for this task. `CHAR(10)` represents the line break in a cell. Here's a way to extract lines from a cell in Excel:
> 
> 1. If your Excel version is 2013 or later, you can use `FILTERXML()`.
> 
> Assume the multilined content is in A2.
> The formula for the first line would be:  
> 
>     `=FILTERXML("<t><s>" & SUBSTITUTE(A2,CHAR(10),"</s><s>") & "</s></t>","//s[1]")`
> 
> For the second line, change the [1] to [2]:
> 
>     `=FILTERXML("<t><s>" & SUBSTITUTE(A2,CHAR(10),"</s><s>") & "</s></t>","//s[2]")`
> 
> And so forth for additional lines.
> 
> 2. Alternatively, if you don't have `FILTERXML()`, you can use a combination of `SUBSTITUTE()`, `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, and `LEN()`.
>     
> For the first line:
> 
>     `=LEFT(A2,(FIND(CHAR(10),A2,1)-1))`
> 
> For the second line:
> 
>     `=MID(A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,1)+1,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,1)+1)-FIND(CHAR(10),A2,1)-1)`
> 
> For the third line and so forth, it may become quite complex. Please consider using a scripting language like VBA for better performance.
> 
> Note: These formulas assume that every line breaks with the `CHAR(10)`. If you have inconsistent line breaks, you'll need to clean those up first.
> 
> Remember to adjust the cell references to match your data.
**user**:
> At most, I have 4 lines. Can you provide the code for lines 3 and 4?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's how you can extract the third and fourth lines from a cell in Excel:
> 
> For the third line:
> 
> ```
> =MID(A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)+1)+1, FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)+1)+1)-FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)-1)
> ```
> 
> For the fourth line:
> 
> ```
> =MID(A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1, LEN(A2))
> ```
> 
> These formulas find the positions of the third and fourth line breaks (CHAR(10)) and extract the text between them using the `MID()` function. Adjust the cell reference (A2) as needed for your data.
> 
> Remember, if you have inconsistent line breaks or need to handle a larger number of lines, using a scripting language like VBA would provide more flexibility and efficiency.
**user**:
> I think your line 3 is actually line 4. Can you try again for line 3?
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the confusion. Let's correct that. Here's the formula to extract the third line from a cell:
> 
> For the third line:
> 
> ```
> =MID(A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)+1)+1, FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)+1)+1)-FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)+1)-1)
> ```
> 
> And here's the formula to extract the fourth line:
> 
> For the fourth line:
> 
> ```
> =RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2,FIND(CHAR(10),A2)+1)+1)+1))
> ```
> 
> These formulas will correctly extract the text between the line breaks (CHAR(10)) to obtain the respective lines. Just adjust the cell reference (A2) as required for your data.
**user**:
> Nope, I'm still missing a line. Can you give me each line, 1 - 4?
**assistant**:
