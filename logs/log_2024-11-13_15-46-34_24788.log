>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)

>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> Dear Professor Rising, 
> I hope you are well. My name is Miriam Crispe and I am a Senior at Eckerd College in St Petersburg, Florida. I am majoring in Marine Science with a minor in Political Science. 
> 
> I am very interested in pursuing a Master's in Marine Policy at the University of New Haven specifically in looking at fisheries management. I would like to apply during this application cycle and I would love to discuss this possibility further if you have the available time and space. 
> 
> My spring semester I am conducting an independent study researching how fisheries management policies have evolved throughout history and looking at how they have changed across different presidential administrations and would love to hear about your experience with this given your work with fisheries management and more specifically with fisheries economics. I am interested in seeing if different administration's response to climate change affects management practices and how this study can be applied when preparing for future administrations.  
> 
> I would love the opportunity to discuss this with you further. I look forward to hearing from you. 
> 
> Thank you for your time and consideration.

> Based on Miriam Crispe's email, she is interested in pursuing a Master's in Marine Policy, specifically focusing on fisheries management, and would like to discuss this further with you. She is currently engaged in independent research on the evolution of fisheries management policies across different U.S. presidential administrations, with an interest in how climate change responses influence these policies. This aligns well with your work in fisheries economics.

> Dear Miriam,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in the Master's programs at the University of Delaware. It's great to hear about your background in Marine Science and Political Science, and your research on fisheries management policies sounds fascinating and aligns well with some of my interests.
> 
> Regarding your interest in a Master's in Marine Policy, I want to inform you that this program has transitioned into our new Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program, which includes a Marine track you might find exciting. If you're also considering researching interdisciplinary aspects, we have various other programs that might be of interest to you.
> 
> To better assist prospective students and match them with potential advisors, we have a new system in place. I encourage you to fill out this form:

> 
> This will help us understand your interests better and guide you towards the most suitable program. 
> 
> If you are interested in a Ph.D. program and believe your research aligns with our quantitative modeling work on fisheries and climate change, I would suggest you mention me in your statement of purpose. Please note that funding for Ph.D. programs is limited, and you should apply by December 1 for full consideration.
> 
> Thank you again for considering our programs, and I hope the form provides you with more clarity about your next steps.
