> I am writing a grant proposal titled NOWASTING (Nutrition Outcomes for
> West African Small-holders, Tracking Impacts on the Ground).  Here is
> the executive summary:
> ===
> NOWASTING will develop new ways to understand the impacts of climate change on food production in the agricultural and fishing sectors, and their consequences for health in vulnerable populations.
> 
> Background: Climate and meteorological conditions can affect the productivity of sectors such as agriculture and fisheries through both direct impacts on the biophysical production process and indirect effects on the environment. Existing research projects climate-driven losses to crucial agricultural production for staple crops across the developing world. While this is partially offset by increased CO2, crop nutrient contents are expected to diminish. Climate change is also expected to undermine marine ecosystems by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean such as temperatures, pH, oxygen content and salinity. These attributes can contribute to undesirable impacts on fish productivity and mortality, as well as population shifts.
> 
> While existing research connects agricultural and fisheries productivity to climatic features (e.g., growing degree-days and sea surface temperatures), the role of ecosystem services is understudied. We seek to fill this gap by analyzing how the impacts of climate change could depend upon the gradual evolution of ecosystem health.
> 
> Despite international commitments to end hunger under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, food insecurity has risen in the last decade across much of the low and lower-middle income world. Food insecurity can lead to malnutrition, as well as stunting, wasting, and a host of other diseases.
> 
> Changes to agriculture and fishery production can play an important role in driving or mitigating these health impacts, especially in smallholder farming and small-scale fishing communities. Crop failures and weakened fisheries can result in both undernutrition and the consumption of foods deficient in essential nutrients like protein, zinc, and iron. On the other hand, sustainable management farming and fishing practices can mitigate many climate impacts, resulting in better health, higher incomes, and more opportunities.
> 
> Objective: Smallholder farmers in Nigeria and artisanal fisheries in Senegal represent the core stakeholder groups in the project. These groups are on the front-lines of climate impacts, as well as stewards of the ecosystem services their communities rely upon. They are both a vulnerable group and a bellwether for vulnerability throughout West Africa.
> 
> NOWASTING will identify health risks in Senegal and Nigeria, investigate climate change effects on agriculture and fishery, and explore adaptation strategies. In particular, we will study climate impacts and associated health risks under multiple management scenarios through 2050. By engaging with stakeholders throughout the project, NOWASTING aims to improve both environmental and human health by providing specific and salient projections that answer stakeholder questions. Our climate and adaptation scenarios, our approach to agriculture and fisheries impacts and smallholder decision-making, and the careful connection we make to health will further be applicable across West Africa and beyond.
> 
> Project Structure: NOWASTING integrates stakeholder engagement (WP1), climate impacts on crop and fisheries (WP2-3), economic decision-making (WP4), and nutrition and health (WP5). Stakeholders, including farmers and fishers, government officials, and NGO representatives, will be engaged throughout the process, but in particular in co-designing work under WP1 and WP5, and informing output metrics from WP2 - 5.
> 
> WP1 (Stakeholder Engagement) will organize workshops to develop environment and adaptation storylines. These will be used throughout the project, and transformed into concrete climate and socioeconomic scenarios for projections under WP2 - 3.
> 
> WP2 (Agriculture) and WP3 (Fisheries) will quantify changes in the productive capacity of staple crops and key fishery species. WP1 and WP2 - 3 will collaboratively derive metrics for both supporting (from WP1) and provision (from WP2 - 3) ecosystem services.
> 
> WP4 (Smallholder Decision-making) will incorporate measures of productivity or yield from WP2 - 3 into economic models that account for individual decision-making and collective policy. WP4 will use these models to produce potential supply and demand for different food products, in coordination with WP5.
> 
> WP5 (Health) will translate food consumption from WP4 into nutritional deficiencies and health outcomes. In addition to specific recommendations to address health risks, WP5 will use food access to better identify groups vulnerable to climate risks, through engaging with stakeholders around climate and health results in concert with WP1.
> 
> Rationale: The project structure bridges key gaps in our understanding of food insecurity, while providing consistent and extensive data to inform stakeholders and policy. This circular structure ensures clear flows of information between adjacent WPs. It is also based on iterative and reciprocal interaction between “adjacent” WPs, rather than a unidirectional flow from WP1 through to WP5.
> 
> By integrating food production and health into one project, we open new opportunities to simultaneously advance scientific understanding and address stakeholder concerns. Our project-wide stakeholder-designed climate and management scenarios allows us to explore connections between climate, food, and health. This development of biophysical productivity also allows us to distinguish the roles of food supply and food access in driving food insecurity.
> 
> This project aligns with the three call themes: Decision-science through stakeholder engagement and policy-directedness; Food security; and Climate Risks to Ecosystems & Populations.
> 
> Outcomes: Our project will produce new results on the productivity of staple crops and key fishery species under climate change, accounting for ecosystem damages and the potential for different improvements in agricultural and fisheries management. Our health measures will include calorie supply, dietary diversity, undernutrition, stunding, wasting, and increased risk of childhood mortality.
> 
> These results will be integrated into a new online tool, the Food Security Futures Explorer. The Explorer will allow users to explore food and health outcomes in high-resolution across future time periods, demographic groups, and climate and management scenarios. The Explorer will feature synthesized metrics on food insecurity, nutritional availability, and health outcomes, co-developed with stakeholders.

As part of thisprogram we have sampled and analysed a range of fi sh species from Senegal for nutrients and foodsafety parameters. The work is performed in collaboration with local scientist withing the fi eld ofnutrition. I have also lead other projects sampling and analysing fi sh from fi sh markets in e.g. Ghana.This knowledge and experience will be of value for this project.

> My main area of expertise is food security and nutrition with focus on micronutrients in aquatic foods. Ihave extensive experience in dietary studies with seafood with special focus on the fi rst thousand days(pregnancy and infants), and development and validation of food frequency questionnaires withbiological marker. Uncertainties in food composition data is a challenge in nutrition monitoring, whichmay lead to incorrect results. I have therefore the last years focused on generating relevant, reliable andup-to-date nutrient composition data on small fi sh. Today, aquatic food makes up a small part of theworld?s food supply and is not well integrated in solving the goals to achieve ?zero hunger? (UN SDG2) and ?good health and well-being? (SDG3). Thus, my research focus on how SDG14 (Life belowwater) can contribute to better nutrition security in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia.
