> The stylized picture of concentric commercial, industrial, and residential regions referred to in theoretical studies of urban geography is known as the "Concentric Zone Model," sometimes also called the "Burgess Model." Designed by sociologist Ernest Burgess in the 1920s, this model imagines a city as a series of concentric rings, each representing a different type or function of the city as follows:
> 
> 1. **Central Business District (CBD):** This is the commercial and business center, usually located at the core of the city.
> 2. **Zone of Transition:** This includes factories, abandoned buildings, and poorer quality homes. As cities grow, this area often undergoes a process of change.
> 3. **Zone of Independent Worker's Homes:** This is the residential area inhabited by the working-class. The homes are of good quality and better than those in the Zone of Transition.
> 4. **Zone of Better Residences:** This area has newer and more spacious houses, often inhabited by the more affluent members of society.
> 5. **Commuter's Zone:** This is the suburban area, which is inhabited by people who work in the CBD but prefer to live in quieter, less densely populated areas.
> 
> It's important to note that while the Concentric Zone Model outlines a basic structure for urban development, it oversimplifies the complexity and diversity of actual cities.
