**assistant**:
> A longitudinal study is a research design that involves repeated observations of the same variables over a long period of time. It can span from several years to even decades.

> The goal of a longitudinal study is to determine the existence of cause and effect relationships among the variables being studied. For instance, it can be used to study the impact of a certain diet over a long time on a person's health, or how educational achievements are influenced by social background and individual characteristics over time.

> In contrast to cross-sectional studies (which measure at a single point in time), longitudinal studies can track change and development, investigate sequences of events, and estimate the time duration to the onset of diseases. However, they may also face challenges such as participant dropout and the cost of follow-ups over extended periods.
