> Hello Austin!
> 
> Yogurt is made by adding special good germs, called bacteria, to milk. These bacteria eat up some of the sugar in the milk and produce an acid. This acid makes the milk thick and gives it the sour taste, making it become yogurt. This might sound like a magic trick, but itâ€™s actually a fun kind of science.

> Ah, no worries! Making yogurt can be a fun and educational activity to try at home if you're interested. If you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!
