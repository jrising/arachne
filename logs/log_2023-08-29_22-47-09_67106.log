> Emergency services in Delaware's marine waters encompass an array of search and rescue operations and law enforcement actions catered towards preserving life, enforcing maritime laws, and providing safety to all maritime stakeholders. Search and rescue missions are often spurred by distress incidents and may involve operations like locating and assisting boats, recovering individuals from the water, or coordinating rescue efforts during severe weather events. Throughout the year, an estimated 200 boats are dedicated to these noble endeavors, with their efforts dominantly stationed in the upper Bay. Law enforcement actions, on the other hand, revolve around ensuring adherence to maritime rules and regulations, monitoring fishing activities, combating illegal activities such as smuggling or illicit fishing, and maintaining general order in the waters. From routine patrols to complex nautical investigations, these activities have proven instrumental in promoting a controlled and safe environment within Delaware's marine domain.
