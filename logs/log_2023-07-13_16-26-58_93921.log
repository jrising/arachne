> I would like a recipe for enchiladas. I have tortillas (flour) and enchilada sauce (mild). Some of the things I would like to include in them are:
>  -  black beans and/or refried beans
>  - cauliflower (I was thinking of cast-ironing it in slices somehow)
>  - cheddar cheese
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James. Here's a twist on classic enchiladas that should be a hit at your dinner table.
> 
> # Cast-iron Cauliflower and Bean Enchiladas
> 
> **Ingredients**
> 
> * 8 flour tortillas
> * 2 cups of mild enchilada sauce
> * 1 can of black beans or refried beans (or use half of each for a unique texture)
> * 1 head of cauliflower, sliced into steaks about 1/2 inch thick
> * Olive oil
> * Salt and pepper to taste
> * 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese
> 
> **Instructions**
> 
> 1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
> 
> 2. Heat your cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Brush both sides of cauliflower steaks with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, then pan-sear them until they're golden brown on each side. This should take about 5-7 minutes per side. Once done, set them aside to cool, then chop into small pieces.
> 
> 3. If you are using canned black beans, drain and rinse these, then combine them with the cauliflower pieces. If using refried beans, they can be spread directly onto the tortillas later.
> 
> 4. Lay out a tortilla, spread a heaping spoonful of refried beans (if using) down the middle, then top with the cauliflower and bean mixture. Sprinkle on a generous amount of cheese.
> 
> 5. Roll the tortilla tightly, then place it in your baking dish, seam side down. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.
> 
> 6. Pour the enchilada sauce evenly over the rolled tortillas, making sure to coat each one fully. Sprinkle additional cheddar cheese on the top.
> 
> 7. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and slightly browning on top.
> 
> 8. Rest for a few minutes before serving. These will be hot!
> 
> **Serving Suggestion**
> 
> Garnish the enchiladas with fresh cilantro, avocado slices, or a dollop of sour cream. Serve with a side salad or lime-infused rice for a complete meal.
> 
> Enjoy your homemade enchiladas, James! Even more so knowing that you've made a nutritious, vegetarian alternative. Let me know if you need any other recipe ideas or help with anything else!
**user**:
> What size of baking dish for the 8 enchiladas?
**assistant**:
> For 8 enchiladas, a standard 9x13-inch baking dish should work well. If you don't have one of that size, you can also use a slightly larger or smaller dish depending on what you have available, as long as it can comfortably fit all the enchiladas in a single layer.
> 
> Just make sure the tortillas fit snugly in the dish without too much extra space around them to prevent them from unrolling during baking.
**user**:
> Should I put down aluminum foil or grease it?
**assistant**:
> It's not necessary to line the baking dish with aluminum foil or grease it for this recipe. However, if you prefer easier cleanup or want to prevent any sticking, you can lightly grease the baking dish with cooking spray or a small amount of oil before arranging the enchiladas. This can help ensure that the tortillas don't stick to the dish.
