> I am using a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy to identify resources and activities that should be taken into account for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. Here is a section of that report:
> ---
> Human Use
> Areas of precaution for wind turbine development carry spatial use conflicts where development may be preferable, although developers and resource managers will have significant considerations and prioritizing in the areas represented. A variety of human uses exist in the study area, from ongoing activity to submerged obstructions.
> 
> Commercial Fishing
> Commercial fishing in the mid-Atlantic has a long history, actively managed by both the Mid- Atlantic Fisheries Management Council (MAFMC) and coordination of selected stocks with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Species managed include Atlantic mackeral, long- finned squid, short-finned squid, butterfish, bluefish, spiny dogfish, surfclam, ocean quahog, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, tilefish, and monkfish (MAFMC, 2011). With planning authority delegated by the MSFCMA, the MAFMC prepares fishery management plans to be implemented by the Secretary of Commerce (MAFMC, 2011). Accordingly, the MAFMC receives input from state representatives, federal representatives, and the general public. The MAFMC also serves as an important venue for stakeholder engagement (MAFMC, 2008). Meetings are open to the public, allowing for comment (written and spoken) regarding fisheries policy.

> Commercial fishermen have traditionally had unrestricted access to ocean waters, although the fisheries management regime has been changing since the 1950s due to recognition of economic theory and conservation principles (Scott, 2008). The process of MSP has given rise to apprehension over space use conflicts among fishing groups, with fishing communities voicing concern regarding access to areas either currently or traditionally fished. Furthermore, offshore wind has come under scrutiny from fishing groups in Nantucket Sound, with expressed concern over the right to fish in areas leased for renewable energy development (Watson & Courtney, 2004). With historic use of the ocean, fishing groups may be expected to have space use conflicts with offshore wind development, and thus their usage of the ocean is important to consider in the mapping process. The Rhode Island Ocean SAMP engaged the commercial and recreational fishing communities extensively during the planning process to ensure important fishing areas were well represented (RI CMRC, 2010).
> To identify areas of commercial (and recreational) fishing, several methods were implemented to measure catch and fishing activity. AIS and vessel monitoring systems (VMS) transmit the locations of vessels, and vessel trip reports (VTR) capture both catch and location. VTR data has been used as a proxy for important fishing locations, but is limited in utility due to confidentiality agreements that require some data to be omitted from the mapping process. Furthermore, VTR provides only one location for catch, although catch may have occurred over a larger area. Initiatives such as the Rhode Island Ocean SAMP and the California MarineMap (http://marinemap.org) have engaged both the commercial and recreational fishing community to identify important fishing areas. This method can access information not available by VTR, but was beyond the scope of this project.
> To illustrate the location of fishing boats, commercial fishing data were obtained through vessel trip reports from NOAA-NMFS, subject to a confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality agreement dictates the display of catch in landings (in pounds) be depicted in 10-minute squares with a minimum of three unique vessels per square to protect proprietary data of the fishing community. This data compiles all self-reported landings throughout these years. Commercial fisheries in the states of New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland use a variety of gear types, both bottom-contacting and pelagic gear. These gear types include: trawl (benthic and pelagic), gillnet, trap, pot, seine, long line, hand line, rake, and dredge. Catch by gear type was summed over the years 2006-2010 to display the total number of trips to an area that resulted in landings, separated by benthic and pelagic gear types. Data were summarized in this manner to indicate the level of use in a given area rather than the quantity of the catch. The number of vessel trips reporting catch in specific areas offers an indication of intensity of use and where space use conflict may occur. Trips reported without longitude/latitude coordinates were removed from the dataset prior to mapping, comprising a total of 3% of the dataset. The dataset was also modified to display only records of three or more unique vessel identification numbers per 10-minute grid, resulting in 1% removal. One caveat with this data is that it does not factor in fish caught in Delaware, Maryland or New Jersey waters which came to port in another state. Point data were converted to raster in 10-minute grid cells, displayed as a sum of trips to a particular grid cell to portray relative intensity of fishing vessels in a given area.
> 
> Pelagic Gear
> Pelagic fishing in 10-minute squares is demonstrated as the aggregate number of trips in which landings occurred using pelagic gear. These are displayed in 10-minute squares as a data restriction required by NFMS. Pelagic gear includes longlines (pelagic only), gillnets (drift, run-around), seines (danish, purse), and handlines. This display was chosen in order to display the frequency of fishing vessels in a given area, to determine the spatial conflicts between fishing vessels and wind turbine development. As evident, pelagic commercial fishing occurs most frequently near the coast, generally diminishing with depth. If pelagic fishermen are permitted to enter the wind project area, conflict may occur with towed gear that will be confined to the space between wind turbine foundations. If pelagic fishing is excluded from wind project areas, conflicts may arise if turbines are installed in the commonly fished areas. The reader is reminded that commercial pelagic fishing occurs elsewhere, however, it is not represented due to confidentiality restrictions. Therefore, any area harvested, but not represented spatially, is fished by less than three vessels. Areas displayed in blue should be given careful consideration in spatial planning due to the propensity of fishing vessels in such areas. However, as with recreational fishing and pelagic gear commercial fishing, consultation with fishing communities is recommended prior to selecting areas for siting offshore wind projects. Please refer to Map 40.
> Benthic Gear
> Benthic Gear fishing includes all gear making contact with the seafloor. The vast majority - 94% - of landings in Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey use gear that is bottom contacting. This includes dredges, sink gillnets, bottom longlines, pots, traps, rakes, and otter trawl. The distinction is made between pelagic and benthic gear due to the potential interference between bottom contacting gear and submerged cables connecting the individual turbines and those running to shore, as well as the relative landings between the two. If those individuals fishing with bottom-contacting gear are permitted to enter wind project areas, conflicts may occur if gear has the potential to damage submerged electric cables. As evident in the Map 41, significant fishing takes place throughout the study area, although it diminishes beyond the 60-meter contour, which is also associated with some fishing restrictions for EFH. If benthic fishing is excluded from wind project areas, conflict may arise if turbines are installed in areas commonly fished. The reader is reminded that benthic commercial fishing occurs elsewhere, however, it is not represented due to confidentiality restrictions. Therefore, any area harvested, but not represented spatially, is fished by less than three vessels. Burial of cables at certain depths and continued vigilance by wind project developers during operation may help to mitigate these impacts and reduce conflicts, although consultation with the fishing community is recommended to minimize conflict. As in previous maps, fishing activity is displayed in 10-minute squares because of data restrictions required by the NMFS.
