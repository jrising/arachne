> Here are some examples of natural-human coupled systems in which humans actively try to manage the natural system:
> 
> 1. **Agricultural Systems**: Agriculture is a form of land-use that manages the natural system to produce crops for food, fiber and other products. This includes traditional farming practices, commercial agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, and more. Humans influence the soil, water, and biodiversity directly through cultivation practices and indirectly through land conversion and market forces.
> 
> 2. **Forestry**: Humans manage forests for timber, carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, recreation, and other ecosystem services. This can include practices like controlled burns, selective logging, and reforestation efforts.
> 
> 3. **Water Resource Systems**: Many human societies actively manage rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater for drinking water, irrigation, hydropower, flood control, waste removal, and ecosystem health.
> 
> 4. **Fishery Systems**: Fisheries are a clear example of a coupled human-natural system, with humans impacting fish populations through fishing practices and sea habitat management, and the health of the fishery system influencing human economies and cultures.
> 
> 5. **Urban Ecosystems**: Cities illustrate intense coupling between socio-economic and ecological processes, with urban planning and architecture shaping the natural environment, and the natural environment offering essential services like cooling, water purification, and aesthetic value.
> 
> 6. **Wildlife Management**: This can include efforts like population control, habitat restoration, the establishment of protected areas, and efforts to reintroduce or conserve endangered species.
> 
> 7. **Climate Engineering/Geoengineering**: Proposals to intervene in the climate system to counteract anthropogenic climate change, such as carbon capture and storage technologies, ocean fertilization, or solar radiation management, are examples of potential future coupled natural-human systems.
> 
> Each of these examples represents a complex interaction of human behaviors and decisions, natural processes, and often unintended consequences. Understanding these coupled systems is a major challenge of environmental sustainability.
