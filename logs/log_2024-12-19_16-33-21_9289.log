> Estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC)â€”the cost of one additional ton of CO2 emittedâ€”is crucial for the analysis of climate change policies. Despite numerous recent studies investigating how fundamental aspects of model structure affect SCC evaluation, findings are scattered, making the relative importance of different modeling elements hard to establish. This paper synthesizes results from the published literature over the last 20 y, revealing a wide range of SCC estimates. However, survey evidence reveals experts believe estimates in the literature are too low due to a range of limitations in published values. Reweighting the literature to partly address these omissions more than doubles the SCC to $283.

> Abstract
> 
> Estimating the cost to society from a ton of CO2â€”termed the social cost of carbon (SCC)â€”requires connecting a model of the climate system with a representation of the economic and social effects of changes in climate, and the aggregation of diverse, uncertain impacts across both time and space. A growing literature has examined the effect of fundamental structural elements of the models supporting SCC calculations. This work has accumulated in a piecemeal fashion, leaving their relative importance unclear. Here, we perform a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the SCC, combining 1,823 estimates of the SCC from 147 studies with a survey of authors of these studies. The distribution of published 2020 SCC values is wide and substantially right-skewed, showing evidence of a heavy right tail (truncated mean of $132). ANOVA reveals important roles for the inclusion of persistent damages, the representation of the Earth system, and distributional weighting. However, our survey reveals that experts believe the literature underestimates the SCC due to an undersampling of model structures, incomplete characterization of damages, and high discount rates. To address this imbalance, we train a random forest model on variation in the literature and use it to generate a synthetic SCC distribution that more closely matches expert assessments of appropriate model structure and discounting. This synthetic distribution has a mean of $283 per ton CO2 for a 2020 pulse year (5% to 95% range: $32 to $874), higher than most official government estimates, including a 2023 update from the U.S. EPA.

> Main points I want to highlight:
>  - Emerged from a workshop in the UK on charting a future for improving economic risk estimates.
>  - It's not just damage functions and discount rates that matter. Structural decisions, like persistence, matter a lot.
>  - Huge effort to review literature and catalog structural decisions made for each SCC estimate.
>  - No existing estimates of the SCC have the range of economic features that experts think are important.
>  - We develop a new "best-estimate", based on the modeling features to reflect expert's opinion.
>  - Methodological contributions: A meta-analysis that accounts for model features using a random forest model is already innovative, and to that drive that with estimates from an expert elicitation is huge. In addition, I developed a cool way to translate Likert scale values into a quantitative meta-analyses; a new random forest algorithm where the leaves are whole distributions; inferred damage functions that account for structural decisions.

>    Estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC) is critical for effective climate change policy-making. However, existing estimates often overlook key structural features, leading to undervaluation. Our latest research, stemming from a collaborative workshop in the UK, set out to refine these estimates through an in-depth review of the literature and strategic model enhancements.
> 
>    We meticulously analyzed 1,823 SCC estimates from various studies, highlighting the importance of structural decisions like damage persistence and the representation of Earth's systems alongside the traditionally emphasized damage functions and discount rates. Through a novel methodology combining meta-analysis with expert elicitation, we recalibrated the SCC to a more realistic $283 per ton, significantly higher than previous figures.
> 
>    This groundbreaking work not only challenges traditional approaches but also introduces innovative methods such as a pioneering random forest model to consider structural elements comprehensively. We believe our findings offer a better-informed foundation for policy development.

> ## Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)
> 
> The social cost of carbon (SCC) represents the economic cost incurred by society for each additional ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere. This metric is essential for shaping effective climate change policies. The higher the SCC, the more justification there is for actions aimed at reducing emissions, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources and implementing stricter regulations.
> 
> However, estimating the SCC is not straightforward. It requires a complex integration of climate models and economic impact assessments, compounded by uncertainties that span across time and geography. Many studies have attempted to measure the SCC, but the results have been varied and sometimes contradictory. 
> 
> ## Breaking New Ground: Our Research
> 
> In our recent paper, "**Synthesis of Evidence Yields High Social Cost of Carbon Due to Structural Model Variation and Uncertainties**," we embarked on a comprehensive review of literature over the past two decades to shed light on these variations. This effort emerged from discussions at a UK workshop focused on improving economic risk estimates related to climate change.
> 
> ### Key Findings
> 
> 1. **Wide Variability in Estimates**: 
>    We synthesized **1,823 SCC estimates** from **147 different studies** and found a wide range of values. The estimated costs were significantly right-skewed, indicating that while some studies report lower figures, there are others with much higher estimates that warrant attention.
> 
> 2. **Beyond Damage Functions and Discount Rates**: 
>    Traditional assessments of SCC often focus on specific aspects like damage functions (how much economic damage results from levels of warming) and discount rates (the value placed on future costs and benefits). Our research emphasizes that structural decisions within modelsâ€”such as how persistent damages are handled and how the Earthâ€™s systems are representedâ€”are equally important in determining the SCC.
> 
> 3. **Expert Insights Reveal Undervaluation**: 
>    We conducted a survey of authors from the studies we reviewed to gather expert opinions. The consensus was striking: experts believe that existing SCC estimates are too low. They pointed to several factors, including the **undersampling of model structures**, **incomplete characterization of damages**, and **high discount rates** as contributors to this undervaluation.
> 
> 4. **The New "Best-Estimate" SCC**: 
>    To address these gaps in the literature, we employed a **random forest model** to refine our understanding of the SCC. This innovative approach allowed us to deduce a new synthetic distribution of SCC estimates that is more in line with expert evaluations. Our analysis yielded a mean SCC of **$283 per ton of CO2** for the year 2020, with a range between **$32 and $874**. This is notably higher than official estimatesâ€”such as those from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released in 2023.
> 
> ### Methodological Innovations
> 
> Our paper also introduces several methodological advancements in the field of climate econometrics:
> 
> - We performed a **meta-analysis** that accounts for different model features, leading to more reliable estimates of the SCC.
> - By translating expert opinions from **Likert scale surveys** into quantitative metrics, we created a more nuanced understanding of how various factors influence the SCC.
> - Our random forest algorithm, where the leaves represent whole distributions rather than specific points, offers a robust way to incorporate uncertainty into our estimates.
> 
> ## Implications for Policy
> 
> The implications of our findings are profound. With an elevated SCC estimate, policymakers may find renewed justification for aggressive climate action. It emphasizes the need for investment in renewable technologies, carbon pricing mechanisms, and robust international climate agreements. 
> 
> ### Moving Forward
> 
> As we seek to navigate the challenges posed by climate change, having accurate and comprehensive estimates of the SCC will be pivotal. Our research illuminates the importance of considering a diverse range of structural elements in modeling. Only by doing so can we create more effective strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change and safeguarding our planet for future generations.
