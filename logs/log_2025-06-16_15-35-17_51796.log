> I have code that renders html with <ins>...</ins> and <del>...</del>, but I want to change the formatting, so the <del> text is just blank and the <ins> text is in bold green. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by using CSS to override the default styling of the `<ins>` and `<del>` tags. Here's how you can style them:
> 
> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html lang="en">
> <head>
>     <meta charset="UTF-8">
>     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>     <title>Styled Insertions and Deletions</title>
>     <style>
>         del {
>             display: none;
>         }
>         ins {
>             font-weight: bold;
>             color: green;
>             text-decoration: none;
>         }
>     </style>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <p>This is some text that was <del>deleted</del> and this is some <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> 
> Here's what this does:
> - The `del` selector hides any text within `<del>...</del>` by setting `display: none;`, making it disappear from the rendered page.
> - The `ins` selector makes any text within `<ins>...</ins>` bold by setting `font-weight: bold;`, and changes its color to green via `color: green;`. The `text-decoration: none;` removes the default underline from the `<ins>` tag.
> 
> You can incorporate this styling directly into your HTML document or add it to a separate CSS file if you prefer to keep your styles organized that way.
**user**:
> Thanks. Now, I also want to grab the final text from this in javascript/jquery. So, that would be the text, with the <del>s deleted. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by using jQuery to manipulate the DOM. Specifically, you can remove the text within `<del>` tags and then retrieve the remaining text, which includes the `<ins>` text styled in green. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:
> 
> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html lang="en">
> <head>
>     <meta charset="UTF-8">
>     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>     <title>Extract Final Text</title>
>     <style>
>         del {
>             display: none;
>         }
>         ins {
>             font-weight: bold;
>             color: green;
>             text-decoration: none;
>         }
>     </style>
>     <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <p id="content">
>         This is some text that was <del>deleted</del> and this is some <ins>inserted</ins> text.
>     </p>
>     <button id="getText">Get Final Text</button>
> 
>     <script>
>         $(document).ready(function() {
>             $('#getText').click(function() {
>                 // Remove the <del> tags and get the text
>                 const finalText = $('#content').text().replace(/ +/g, ' ').trim();
>                 console.log(finalText);
>                 alert(finalText); // Or handle the final text as needed
>             });
>         });
>     </script>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation:
> - **jQuery Library**: We include the jQuery library from a CDN.
> - **Button**: A button with the ID `getText` is included to trigger the text retrieval.
> - **Script Section**: On document ready, we set a click event on the button:
>   - We use `$('#content').text()` to get the text content of the paragraph, which automatically excludes the `<del>` text since it's set to be hidden.
>   - The `replace(/ +/g, ' ')` method is used to ensure that multiple spaces are condensed into a single space, and `trim()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
>   
> When you click the button, the console will log the final text, and an alert will display it. You can modify that part of the function to handle the final text as you need.
**user**:
> I tried it, and .text() does not appear to drop whatever is between <del>...</del>.
**assistant**:
> You're correct! The `.text()` method retrieves the text content, including the text from `<del>`. If you want to exclude the text within `<del>` tags specifically, we can use a different approach to achieve that.
> 
> You can traverse the child nodes of the paragraph and gather text while skipping the `<del>` elements. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html lang="en">
> <head>
>     <meta charset="UTF-8">
>     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

>         del {
>             display: none;

>         ins {
>             font-weight: bold;
>             color: green;
>             text-decoration: none;
>         }

>     </p>
>     <button id="getText">Get Final Text</button>
> 
>     <script>
>         $(document).ready(function() {
>             $('#getText').click(function() {
>                 let finalText = '';
>                 $('#content').contents().each(function() {
>                     // Check if the node is a text node or an <ins> element
>                     if (this.nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE) {
>                         finalText += this.textContent;
>                     } else if (this.nodeName === 'INS') {
>                         finalText += this.textContent;
>                     }
>                 });
>                 
>                 finalText = finalText.replace(/ +/g, ' ').trim(); // Clean up spaces
>                 console.log(finalText);
>                 alert(finalText); // Or handle the final text as needed
>             });
>         });
>     </script>
> </body>
> </html>

> 
> ### Explanation:
> - **`$('#content').contents().each(function() {...})`**: This retrieves all child nodes (including text nodes and elements) of the `#content` paragraph.
> - **Node Types**: We check if the node is a text node using `Node.TEXT_NODE`. If it is, we append its text content to `finalText`. If the node is an `<ins>` element, we append its text content as well.
> - **Clean Up**: Finally, we use the same space cleanup as before to ensure the text is formatted correctly.
> 
> This way, the resulting text will exclude any text from `<del>` tags, giving you exactly what you want!
