> Introduction and Motivation from Bootcamp
> To achieve its ambitious net-zero goals in the coming decades, the United States is pouring significant investments into clean energy technologies and revamping policies to overcome deployment barriers1. Researchers across many disciplines are engaged in answering relevant questions: which technologies will support these goals? who will benefit or be affected by different approaches? and what will be the environmental impacts of our decisions? However, a significant hurdle for integrating this research into policy-making is the communication gap between academics and policymakers. To bridge this gap and ensure an equitable transition that is grounded in the best available science and technologies, it is vital to develop effective strategies for translating research findings into actionable policy recommendations. 
> 
> As part of a week-long bootcamp aimed at exposing early career energy and climate academics to federal policy making in Washington D.C., we engaged in discussions with bipartisan policy-makers and aides across multiple ranks, departments, and roles within the policy system. A common thread that emerged from these conversations was the role of academic research in informing evidence-based policy-making. Several of these actors highlighted the importance of effective storytelling as a way to close the academic-policy gap, focusing on materials closely targeted to each department's priorities, the constituents they serve, or technologies being considered in ongoing legislative processes. By doing so, academics can better connect their research to policy-making and increase its impact.

> Actionable research is salient, credible, and legitimate2; producing reliable results (credible), relevant information (salience), and including the views of various actors (legitimate). However, evidence can be contested within the policy process, where scientific evidence is often used to justify pre-existing beliefs and decisions 3.  Researchers in technical and quantitative spaces and in traditional academic settings are often incentivized to largely focus on the credibility of their research; while policymakers highly value saliency and legitimacy. As early-career scientists and engineers in the climate and energy space, we recognize the importance of informing policymakers with our research findings. However, the existing system often fails to provide adequate incentives or opportunities for us to do so. 
> Misalignment of incentives
> To address critical energy and climate issues, policymakers need to make informed decisions. Scientific evidence and guidance are essential ingredients for making effective and reliable policies 4. Uncertainty over energy and climate policies can severely hinder the transition to clean energy. This is particularly relevant to the United States, where climate policy uncertainty has been triggered by the initial withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and subsequent re-commitment 5. In view of that, significant efforts have been made to translate scientific work on energy and climate into policy action over the last three decades 6. Recent examples include work by nine independent research teams modeling the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on U.S. carbon emissions 7. However, evidence is often not uncontested in policymaking, and competing interpretations among actors can lead to it being only partially reflected in policy actions.
> Academics in the climate and energy space often have the goal of benefitting society. This is a shared purpose with policymakers. However, the way it is approached is different– academics are focused on providing innovative research in their relevant field, while policymakers are focused on prioritizing the outcomes of their constituents. This means that cutting-edge research in the energy and climate space can be overlooked, lost in translation, or go against political will. For example, carbon taxation was heavily favored by academics, but not by politicians 8. Nevertheless, academia can provide value by informing policymakers about recent academic scientific research and social perceptions of a given topic. This view marries the systematic rigor of academia with societal impacts and provides policymakers with a complete view including potential public opinion, to make more informed decisions. 
> A key question that emerges is how can academic evidence i) become more relevant to policy-makers, and; ii) be better communicated to policymakers? Tangney 6 suggests combining elements from two models of expertise: the “linear model”, which assumes that impartial academic expertise directly drives rational policy-making, and the “co-production model”, where academic experts and policy-makers collaborate as equal partners. For either model to work, modern energy and climate research should engage with pressing problems. Future research directions could include integrating behavioral change with technological innovation, exploring the socio-technical aspects of the energy transition, examining the role of digital technology, understanding the politics of design and resilience, and addressing equity and justice issues 9,10. These directions highlight the need for interdisciplinary teams to produce policy-relevant work. 
> 
> Policy-makers’ needs often differ from what academics deliver 11. Policymakers require good (not perfect) answers and clear predictions quickly. They need specific, timely, and actionable recommendations, not generalizations, and their expertise is not on the scientific methods and uncertainties often reported. While in DC, we found that storytelling is the currency of the capital, which means that academics must be better equipped to translate their novel research findings into the language of stories that policymakers use. To both learn how to better tell stories and have capacity to invest time in proper communication, the incentives that academics operate under must be realigned to encourage relevant policy work.
> Call to Action
> A re-alignment of incentives is needed. This requires systemic change 12, and here we focus on potential changes in the academic and political system that could improve the impacts of research on policy. Here we propose three key areas for action: 1) evaluation and promotion structures and incentives, 2) communication from policymakers to academics, and 3) communication from academics to policymakers.
> Evaluation and Promotion Structures and Incentives [330 words]
> While many federal/state agencies, including NSF, have incorporated "broader impacts" criteria 13, the importance of these contributions is not explicitly captured by many promotion and tenure guidelines. We call on universities to credit academics’ interactions with policy as part of their promotion and tenure process. This will be a major departure from the status quo, where the success of academics is often measured independently of their engagement with policy-makers 14. While many academics aspire to benefit society with their work, they also spend significant amounts of time and effort to achieve professional success and recognition. We propose aligning these goals to incentivize academics to actively set the foundations for societal benefit to be realized.
> Commonly, tenure and promotion in academic institutions are awarded to individuals who demonstrate excellence in three areas: research, teaching, and service. We provide three tangible suggestions for interaction with policy-makers to positively count towards success in these areas:
> Research: Publishing policy briefs or white papers, being cited in policy documents, or submitting to government requests for information (RFIs) could carry a certain weight alongside publishing articles in scientific journals. While briefs and white papers are often not peer-reviewed and thus cannot carry the same weight as scientific publications, making them part of the promotion process is a strong incentive for i) academics to become better communicators of their work to policy audiences, and ii) institutions to provide academics with the necessary training.
> Teaching: Lessons learned from interactions with policy-makers, and up-to-date policy briefs can be integrated into teaching materials and provide valuable insights to students. Acknowledging such efforts in tenure and promotion evaluation processes can further encourage academics to seek direct interactions with policy-makers. To that end, continuing and supporting communication initiatives such as our Bootcamp in DC will be valuable.
> Service: While strong public engagement and outreach programs exist in academic institutions across the country, the scope of service required for tenure and promotion is usually internal, and prioritizes the department, college, and university levels. We suggest that successful engagement with local, state, and federal level policy-makers should formally count as service.
> While these metrics form an important core of faculty incentive structures, a transformation should consider the broader ecosystem of faculty recruitment, retention, and professional development 15. Such a transformation would also include Ph.D. and postdoctoral preparation, since early-career faculty are underprepared for engaging in public service and outreach16. 
> Communication from policymakers to academics [330 words]
> Many academics would like to address questions that are seen as useful by policymakers, but do not know exactly what is needed. 
> 
> In a meta-analysis of several studies, Oliver et al. 17 found that the most frequently reported barriers to evidence-based policymaking were the lack of collaboration between researchers and policy makers, and the importance of relationships. Hanna et al.12 suggest that policy-focused workshops would help scholars to directly interact with government officials to sharpen research questions and seek collaboration opportunities. Without such a mechanism, it is challenging for an academic to establish relationships with policymakers. Efforts such as this Bootcamp can aid in building these connections. Another potential avenue would be to make requests for information more responsive. Currently, when academics submit to these calls they get no response or see the outcomes of their efforts. Instead, these could be used to initiate two-way conversations between academics and policymakers.
> Academics can target scientific research that provides tangible benefits to the public. Policies influence modeling in terms of data, assumptions, and study scope18. Funding opportunities impact what questions academia is able to pursue  (e.g. the National Science Foundation's Accelerating Research Translation program19). 
> Communication from academics to policymakers [330 words]
> We need more accessible science– this can be achieved through open science, targeted research, and translating research into usable content for policymakers such as policy briefs.
> Open-access data, tools, and publications play a pivotal role in enhancing transparency and collaboration in climate and energy research, which is essential for crafting adaptable and inclusive energy policies20 (examples include PUDL21, OpenMod22, NIH’s public access policy, EnROADS23, and the FAIR scientific practices24). Open science promotes cost savings and innovation while fostering more accessible decision-making processes that support evidence-based policies.
> Additionally, policy briefs, written by many groups and universities, have also proven to be an effective knowledge transfer tool that offers easy-to-understand and credible insights 25. Similarly effective venues for translating research for policymakers include press releases, perspective pieces, news articles, and policy forums such as the Conversation. Policy briefs are a low barrier to research translation and allow for more efficient communication between researchers, journalists, and policymakers. Policy briefs are not meant as an opportunity to provide prescriptions or lanes for advocacy, but rather a way to distill scientific work to language and scenarios that are tangible for policymakers. Targeted policy brief dissemination may allow interaction between policymakers and scientists, encouraging policymakers to attentively consider the policy brief and provide feedback to academics.
> 
> We are developing a crowd-sourced web platform that hosts climate-energy research briefs for policymakers hosted by the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability. The purpose of the platform is to connect the output of researchers to policymakers through 2-page briefs written in plain language, with navigation oriented towards policymakers. Scientists may reframe their motivation and findings in the language of policymakers –including storytelling and anecdotes– based on timely events and current contexts. The web platform will include training tools for academics to communicate with policy audiences. The format of the website, the content of research briefs, and the training tools available for researchers will improve communication with policymakers. 
> Conclusion
> Several barriers currently undermine the role of science in policy-making. A major challenge is the misalignment of incentives between academics and policy-makers. Academic researchers are not recognized for their contributions to policy, effectively discouraging them from investing time and resources to understand the political economy behind policy change. Meanwhile, policy-makers have to prioritize their constituents. This disconnect can lead to a lack of investment and engagement in policy-making processes, undermining science's potential to support positive changes.
> 
> However, most scientific work in energy and climate has direct benefits for interested parties, and scientists are often motivated to go beyond their academic demands to improve outcomes in the real world. The pathway for scientific results to improve policy-making can be significantly improved by addressing the potential for communication between academics and policymakers (in both directions), and improving academic promotion structures. We call for changes to academic systems and interactions with policymakers to allow academics to improve their storytelling and better support evidence-based policy-making.
