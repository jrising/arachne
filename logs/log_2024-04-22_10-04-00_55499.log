> How can I find and extract a four-digit year in a string in R?
**assistant**:
> Here's a simple approach using regular expressions and the `str_extract()` function from the `stringr` package in R to find and extract a four-digit year:
> 
> ```r
> # Example: suppose we have the following vector of strings
> strVec <- c("This happened in 1999", "The year was 2010", "Event occurred in 2023")
> 
> # Use the str_extract function in the stringr package
> library(stringr)
> 
> # Pattern to match any four digits
> pattern <- "\\b\\d{4}\\b"
> 
> # Extract year
> years <- str_extract(strVec, pattern)
> 
> print(years)
> ```
> 
> This will output:
> 
> ```r
> [1] "1999" "2010" "2023"
> ```
> In the regular expression above, `\\b` represent word boundaries (zero-width positions between a word character and a non-word character or between a word character and the start/end of the string). `\\d` matches any digit, and `{4}` specifies that we want exactly four of the preceding element.
> 
> Make sure your string does not have other four-digit numbers that are not years, or this method might extract the wrong number.
**user**:
> How do I check if one string contains another in R?
**assistant**:
> You can use the `grepl()` function in R to check if one string contains another. Here's an example using `grepl()`:
> 
> ```r
> # Example strings
> string1 <- "Hello, how are you?"
> string2 <- "how are"
> 
> # Check if string2 is contained within string1
> if (grepl(string2, string1)) {
>   print("string2 is contained in string1")
> } else {
>   print("string2 is not contained in string1")
> }
> ```
> 
> In this example, the `grepl()` function returns `TRUE` if `string2` is found within `string1`, and `FALSE` otherwise. 
> 
> You can also use this function with regular expressions to perform more complex string matching tasks.
**user**:
> How do I strip whitespace around a string in R?
**assistant**:
> To strip whitespace around a string in R, you can use the `trimws()` function. Here's an example:
> 
> ```r
> # Example string with leading and trailing whitespace
> string_with_spaces <- "   This is a string with spaces around it   "
> 
> # Trim whitespace around the string
> trimmed_string <- trimws(string_with_spaces)
> 
> # Print the original and trimmed strings
> print(paste("Original string:", string_with_spaces))
> print(paste("Trimmed string:", trimmed_string))
> ```
> 
> When you run this code, you will see the original string with leading and trailing spaces, and the trimmed string with those spaces removed.
> 
> The `trimws()` function can also be used to trim whitespace at the beginning (`side = "left"`) or end (`side = "right"`) of a string specifically, if needed.
