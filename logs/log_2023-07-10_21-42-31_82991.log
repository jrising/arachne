> I am working on a project described as follows:
> The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is developing plans for the range of possible future activities in the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean. In support of this work, this research project is identifying available datasets and important information that is not currently available (“data gaps”). As part of this work, we will be interviewing a range of stakeholders, including government officials, business-owners, and citizen groups to understand how they use Delaware’s waters and what information they rely on.
> 
> In the IRB protocol form, I am asked to "Describe all procedures involving human subjects for this protocol.  Include copies of all surveys and research measures." Can you outline the information that needs to go into this section?
**assistant**:
> Sure, when a project involves human subjects, there are certain procedural and ethical guidelines that need to be adhered to, as outlined by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). For your project involving surveys and interviews with stakeholders, your description of procedures involving human subjects may include:
>   
> 1. **Recruitment**: Explain how you will identify and attract potential participants. This could include publicly posted invitations, direct contact via email, etc.
> 
> 2. **Informed Consent Process**: Describe how you will inform participants about the study, its purpose, the procedures they will undergo, potential risks and benefits, and their rights (cf. confidentiality, voluntary participation). An informed consent form needs to be attached if used.
> 
> 3. **Methodology**: Discuss the specific methods you will use to collect data. For this project, you will likely need to include a copy of the interview script or survey instrument, and specify which types of stakeholders these tools will be used on. 
> 
> 4. **Data Handling**: You should lay out how you plan to protect the anonymity and confidentiality of your participants. Explain how you'll collect the data (anonymously or by using pseudonyms), how you'll store it (encrypted digital file), and who will have access to it.
> 
> 5. **Risk/Benefit Analysis**: Detail any potential risks to participants - emotional distress, time investment, etc. Also, if there are no immediate benefits for participants, it may be worth acknowledging this.
> 
> 6. **Procedure Timing**: Estimate the total time commitment for participants.
> 
> 7. **Debriefing (if applicable)**: If you will provide feedback to participants after the study's conclusion, describe the process and timing of this feedback.
> 
> 8. **Surveys and Research Measures**: If the study involves surveys, questionnaires, or any other research measures, each should be included in an appendix to the protocol for review.
> 
> Remember, the goal of the IRB review isn't to be a hurdle, but to ensure the ethical treatment of human subjects. You're demonstrating that people's rights and safety will be respected throughout this project.
