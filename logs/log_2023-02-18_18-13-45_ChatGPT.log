> Do you need to use your blinkers in a turn-only lane in the US?
**assistant**:
> In the US, the use of blinkers is typically required when changing lanes, merging, and turning. This includes when using a turn-only lane. Even if the lane is designated for turning, using your blinker lets other drivers know your intentions and helps promote safe driving practices.

> Additionally, in some states, failure to use your turn signals properly could result in a traffic violation and a fine. It is always a good practice to use your blinkers when turning, changing lanes, or merging, even if it is not required by law in your particular state.
