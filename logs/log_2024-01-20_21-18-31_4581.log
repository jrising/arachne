**assistant**:
> Based on the information you provided, I have a few points to consider:
> 
> 1. The packages listed are not part of the standalone FFmpeg software, but they are related as they are libraries used by FFmpeg and probably also by other installed software packages on your machine. They provide functionalities for various audio/video processing tasks.
> 
> 2. Uninstalling these packages right away might not be the best course of action, as they might be dependencies for other software on your Linux machine.
> 
> 3. The ‘esm2’ in the package name seems to refer to Extended Security Maintenance, which is a special update channel maintained by Ubuntu for longer support periods. These are usually a bit behind the regular releases but they have a longer support period.
> 
> I propose the following steps to proceed:
> 
> 1. Identify which programs in your machine use these libraries. You can use the command `apt rdepends <package-name>` for that. If those programs are not critical, consider uninstalling or updating them.
> 
> 2. If the programs using these libraries are critical, consider subscribing to Ubuntu Pro's free tier for personal use. As your contact mentioned, it's free for up to 5 personal devices and would ensure you receive the security updates for these packages.
> 
> 3. If neither of the above options is feasible, it's advisable to wait for your support team to readdress the vulnerabilities once they sync with the new service.
> 
> Remember that running a Linux system invariably involves some risk due to potential vulnerabilities, but with regular updates and prudent management of your installed software, you can keep this risk quite low.
**user**:
> Does rdepends only list packages that are installed and depend on the identified package? It seems to list a lot of stuff that I don't have.
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the confusion. You are correct that the `rdepends` command in `apt` displays both installed packages that depend on the identified package as well as packages available in the repositories that have dependencies on the identified package. This can sometimes result in a longer list of packages than what is actually installed on your system.
> 
> To narrow down the output and focus only on the packages installed on your machine that depend on the identified package, you can use the `--installed` flag with the `rdepends` command. This will restrict the output to only the installed packages that have a dependency on the identified package.
> 
> Here's an example command:
> 
> ```
> apt rdepends --installed <package-name>
> ```
> 
> Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to investigate. Running this command will provide a more targeted list of installed packages that rely on the identified package. Review this list to determine if there are any critical packages that would be affected by uninstalling or updating the identified package.
**user**:
> How do I uninstall these packages, once I've identified that I don't need them?
**assistant**:
> To uninstall packages on Ubuntu (or any Debian-based distribution), you will use the `apt-get` or `apt` command followed by `remove`. However, keep in mind that removing a package might remove other packages that depend on it.
> 
> Here's the general command structure for removing packages:
> 
> ```sh
> sudo apt-get remove --purge package-name
> ```
> 
> Or 
> 
> ```sh
> sudo apt remove --purge package-name
> ```
> 
> The `--purge` option tells `apt` to remove both the package and its configuration files. If you prefer to keep the configuration files (which can be useful if you plan to reinstall the package later), you can omit the `--purge` option.
> 
> If you have identified and verified that the packages you intend to uninstall are not needed, you can proceed. For each of the identified packages, run:
> 
> ```sh
> sudo apt-get remove --purge libavcodec58
> sudo apt-get remove --purge libavfilter7
> sudo apt-get remove --purge libavformat58
> sudo apt-get remove --purge libavutil56
> sudo apt-get remove --purge libpostproc55
> sudo apt-get remove --purge libswresample3
> sudo apt-get remove --purge libswscale5
> ```
> 
> As you remove packages, pay attention to the list of additionally removed packages that `apt` will provide. This list will include any packages that depend on the packages you're removing. If you see something critical in that list, you might decide to abort the removal by saying 'n' when prompted.
> 
> **Pro tip:** Before making such changes, it's always a good idea to have a current backup or snapshot of your system, in case something goes wrong or some critical dependency gets removed by accident.
> 
> Lastly, after removal, you might want to run:
> 
> ```sh
> sudo apt-get autoremove
> ```
> 
> This command removes any packages and dependencies that were installed with the removed packages and are no longer needed.
