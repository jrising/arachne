> What is the best app or website for finding restaurants when traveling in Portugal? I know Google maps is not used everywhere, and I don't know if Yelp is still in as active use as it was some years ago.

> As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, the following apps and websites were commonly used for finding restaurants in various locations including Portugal:
> 
> 1. TripAdvisor: This is one of the most globally recognized travel platforms. Users can check out user ratings and reviews of various restaurants in Portugal. 
> 
> 2. Zomato: Zomato offers listings for restaurants and cafes in many cities worldwide, including some in Portugal. They provide customer reviews, menu images, and price ranges.
> 
> 3. TheFork (known as "LaFourchette" in French): This is an online restaurant reservation platform that operates in several countries, including Portugal. They offer special discounts and have user reviews of restaurants.
> 
> 4. Google Maps: Even though it's not used everywhere, it is widely used in many parts of the world including Portugal. It's a good tool for finding restaurants, reading reviews, and getting directions.
> 
> As of 2023, I would recommend checking the current availability and popularity of these platforms in Portugal, as well as any new apps or websites that might have become popular since my training data.
> 
> For the most localized recommendations, you might also consider asking locals when you arrive. They often have the best insights into where to find good food.
