> Greetings Professor!
> 
> I hope you are doing well. My name is Arqam Tariq and I am currently a PhD in Public Policy & Administration Student at the Biden School. I have been thinking of switching to PhD Environmental Economics for quite some time. Accordingly, I reached out to Professor Carlos Moffat and he advised me to reach out to potential advisors first to identify a potential project.
> 
> Therefore, I am writing to you. Before joining the PhD program at UDel, I was working with the government in Pakistan as a civil servant in the Finance Department. Besides multiple policy areas, I was also looking after Environmental fiscal policy, budget allocation, and expenditure. I also co-authored a paper on "Addressing Fisheries Policies in Pakistan Using Deep Learning," which I have attached here. Academically, I completed my MPA in International Economic Policy from Columbia University in the City of New York in 2021.
> 
> As far as the proposed project is concerned, broadly, I am interested in working on how policies at the sub-national level can help in mitigating environmental impacts both financially and environmentally, and how sub-national policies can help facilitate a shift to renewable energy resources, use of EVs especially in developing countries. However, I am open to further discussion and adjusting my research focus accordingly.

> Dear Arqam Tariq,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in pursuing a PhD in Environmental Economics. I appreciate the background information you’ve shared about your experience in government and your academic credentials.
> 
> Your proposed research on sub-national policies for mitigating environmental impacts and facilitating a shift to renewable energy is intriguing, especially from the perspective of developing countries. While, unfortunately, there is currently no available funding for new PhD students under my supervision, I am open to discussing your research interests further.
