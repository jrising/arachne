**user**:
> I want to retrieve a URL in python. If I get back HTML, I want to process it one way in memory. If I get back a PDF, I'll process it another, saving it to a file and then checking it. And if it's neither, I want to drop it. Also, if the download is too big or takes too long, I want to drop it. How can I do this?

> Certainly! This is a common task that can be handled efficiently with the `requests` library in Python, along with some additional packages like `beautifulsoup4` for HTML and `PyPDF2` for PDF processing. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive example of how you might structure your code to achieve these requirements:
> 
> ```python
> import requests
> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  # For HTML processing
> from PyPDF2 import PdfReader   # For PDF processing
> import os
> 
> def process_html(content):
>     """Process HTML content."""
>     soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')
>     # Example processing: extracting all text
>     text = soup.get_text()
>     print("HTML Content Processed:", text[:200])  # Print first 200 characters for brevity
> 
> def process_pdf(file_path):
>     """Process PDF file."""
>     with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
>         reader = PdfReader(file)
>         text = ""
>         # Example processing: extracting text from each page
>         for page in reader.pages:
>             text += page.extract_text()
>     print("PDF Content Extracted:", text[:200])  # Print first 200 characters for brevity
> 
> def download_and_process(url):
>     try:
>         # Set a timeout and limit for streaming to control download size
>         response = requests.get(url, timeout=10, stream=True)
>         
>         # Check for response size limit (e.g., 10 MB)
>         max_size_mb = 10
>         total_size = 0
>         chunk_size = 1024
> 
>         complete_content = bytes()
>         for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=chunk_size):
>             total_size += len(chunk)
>             if total_size > max_size_mb * 1024 * 1024:
>                 print("Downloaded content exceeds size limit and will be dropped.")
>                 return
>             complete_content += chunk
> 
>         content_type = response.headers.get('Content-Type', '')
>         
>         # Determine content type and process accordingly
>         if 'text/html' in content_type:
>             process_html(complete_content.decode('utf-8'))
>         elif 'application/pdf' in content_type:
>             pdf_file_path = "downloaded.pdf"
>             # Save PDF to file
>             with open(pdf_file_path, 'wb') as f:
>                 f.write(complete_content)
>             process_pdf(pdf_file_path)
>             os.remove(pdf_file_path)  # Clean up the PDF file after processing
>         else:
>             print("Content type is not supported and will be dropped.")
>             
>     except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
>         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
> 
> # Usage
> url = "http://example.com/somefile"  # Replace with your URL
> download_and_process(url)
> ```
> 
> ### Key Points:
> 1. **Timeout and Streaming**: Set a `timeout` for the request to ensure it doesn't hang, and use `stream=True` to download the content in chunks, enabling control over large files.
>    
> 2. **Content-Type Checking**: The `Content-Type` header is used to determine if the content is HTML, PDF, or unsupported.
> 
> 3. **Size Limiting**: This script checks the downloaded size to ensure it doesn't exceed a specified limit, dropping it if it does.
> 
> 4. **Library Usage**: Utilize `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML and `PyPDF2` for reading PDFs.
> 
> 5. **Error Handling**: Wrap the request with a try-except block to handle network issues gracefully.
> 
> Make sure to install the necessary libraries, if not already available, using:
> ```bash
> pip install requests beautifulsoup4 PyPDF2
> ```
