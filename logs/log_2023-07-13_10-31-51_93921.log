**assistant**:
> Yes, in Julia, the equivalent function to R's `colSums()` is the `sum()` function, combined with the dimension argument.

> This will calculate the sum across columns. The `dims=1` argument indicates that the operation should be performed column-wise. On the other hand, if you want row-wise sums, use `dims=2`.
