> In Question 1.1, Current Exposures:
> 
> Which direct and indirect dependencies does the economy and the financial sector, including through insured and financed activities, have on ecosystem services? Which direct and indirect negative impacts does the economy and the financial sector have on nature? Which of those dependencies and negative impacts could be material sources of physical and transition risk from a microprudential, macroprudential, and macroeconomic risk perspective?
> 
> Now onto Question 1.2, Priorities:
> 
> What are the key sectors with the highest impacts and dependencies, both direct and indirect, on nature? What are the critical global, regional, or local ecosystems these key sectors, or the economy and financial sector as a whole, interact with, and where are they located? What is the current or estimated state of these critical ecosystems?

> 
> Are there any future developments that should be considered when assessing sources of physical and transition risks, such as emerging policy frameworks or the sudden collapse of one or more ecosystem services? Over what time horizon are these forward-looking developments expected to materialize?
> 
> Continuing to Question 1.4, Climate-Nature Nexus:
> 
> How does the consideration of climate change, and related mitigation and adaptation strategies, affect the identification of potential nature-related financial risk? Could sectors with large dependencies or impacts on nature be contributing to climate change, or be affected by it? Which strategies for climate change mitigation have the potential to cause inadvertent negative effects on ecosystems, thereby amplifying nature-related financial risks?

> Phase 2: Assess economic risks.
> 
> This includes the following areas:
> 
> Value Chains: Where are the direct economic effects located, domestically or abroad? Can direct effects transfer across borders and amplify, including domestically, through value chains, resulting in indirect economic effects?
> 
> Micro-Macro Interaction: To what extent do economic effects on households and businesses, as a result of nature-related financial risks, lead to macroeconomic deterioration, including lower productivity or inflationary pressures?
> 
> Vulnerability, Adaptation, and Substitution: How vulnerable are economic actors given their ability to adapt, such as via substitution? For the identified economic transmission channels, what technological or geographical substitution possibilities are available that could mitigate shocks and hazards?
> 
> Phase 3: Assess risk to, from, and within the financial system.
> 
> This includes the following areas:
> 
> Transmission: How can economic risks transmit to traditional financial risk categories? Can risks cascade to different value chains?
> 
> Systemic Dimension: How can nature-related financial risks amplify via feedback loops within the financial sector, or between the financial sector and the real economy?
> 
> Endogenous Risk: Is the financial sector materially contributing to the physical risks it is exposed to?
