**user**:
> What are the units used to measure fertilizer application and what are typical values?
**assistant**:
> Fertilizer application is typically measured in mass units, such as kilograms (kg) or pounds (lb), or in volume units, such as liters (L) or gallons (gal). The choice of units depends on the specific fertilizer and regional conventions.
> 
> For solid fertilizers, the application rates are usually expressed in mass units per unit area (e.g., kg/ha or lb/acre). Typical values can vary depending on the crop, soil conditions, and specific nutrient requirements. As a general guideline, common application rates for solid fertilizers range from around 50 to 200 kg/ha (or roughly 45 to 180 lb/acre).
> 
> For liquid fertilizers, the application rates are often expressed in volume units per unit area (e.g., L/ha or gal/acre). Typical values for liquid fertilizers can also vary depending on the crop and desired nutrient concentration. As an example, liquid nitrogen fertilizers may be applied at rates of 20 to 80 L/ha (or approximately 2 to 8 gal/acre).
> 
> It's important to note that these are just rough ranges, and actual application rates will depend on various factors, including local agricultural practices, soil testing, and nutrient management recommendations. It's always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension services or professionals for specific fertilizer recommendations tailored to your region and crop needs.
