> I am writing a report on the case for investment into adaptation. For this report, we synthesize available evidence on (1) macroeconomic (GDP effects, productivity loss, interest, inflation, etc.) or fiscal (budget balance, borrowing costs, public expenditure or revenue, etc.) impacts of climate change, and (2) adaptation costs and benefit (or related measures like ROI, NPV) of national scale adaptation. We want to ensure that this report provides information in a form that is relevant and accessible to finance ministries and other economic decision-makers. In support of that, I will be doing a series of interviews of representatives of ministries of finance, bringing to them some of our results and getting reactions.

> I'm sending these people a letter of introduction, and I was wondering if I need an "Interview Preparation" sheet to go with it. For other topical interviews, we've basically sent them some of the questions beforehand. Should I share something like that for this?
**assistant**:
> For interviews with finance ministry representatives regarding your report on climate change adaptation investment, it's advisable to provide an "Interview Preparation" sheet alongside your letter of introduction. This sheet can serve as a guide to stimulate productive discussions and ensure that your interviewees are well-prepared to engage with the topics at hand.
> 
> Here's a suggested approach for the "Interview Preparation" sheet:
> 
> 1. **Purpose and Context**: Start with a brief overview of the report's goals and the importance of their input in shaping its findings. Highlight the critical nature of understanding economic impacts and adaptation investments.
> 
> 2. **Key Topics**: Outline the primary subjects you'll be discussing, such as macroeconomic impacts of climate change, fiscal implications, and the ROI or cost-benefit analysis of adaptation strategies. This helps interviewees focus on areas where their insights will be most valuable.
> 
> 3. **Sample Questions**: Instead of sharing all questions, provide a few sample questions to give an idea of the type of discussion expected. This might include questions about their views on climate risks, experience with adaptation policies, and considerations for economic planning.
> 
> 4. **Background Materials**: Offer a concise summary or a few bullet points of relevant findings from your research in advance. This can prime their thinking and lead to more informed responses.
> 
> 5. **Logistics**: Include details about the interview format, duration, and any technical requirements (e.g., platform for virtual meetings).
> 
> By providing this preparation sheet, you not only respect their time but also encourage a more in-depth dialogue. This approach could yield richer insights while ensuring alignment between your research objectives and their expertise.
