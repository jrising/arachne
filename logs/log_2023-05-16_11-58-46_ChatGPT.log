> Climate change poses significant risks to agricultural production, particularly perennial crops crucial in many developing countries. Misreported yields and unseen management decisions can obscure understanding of these risks. This study, focusing on Brazilian coffee production, shows that extreme temperatures decrease yields and reported harvest area through plant death and selective harvesting. Damages from extreme temperatures on production are double their effect on reported yields, as these are calculated using harvested rather than bearing area. By merging perennial supply and yield statistics within a structural econometric framework, the effects of management decisions become distinguishable. The research uncovers a greater direct impact of extreme temperatures on biophysical yields and a multi-year plant death effect, enhancing understanding of price, weather, and adaptation interplay across perennial crops.
