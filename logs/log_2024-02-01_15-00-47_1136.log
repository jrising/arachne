> Current Activities
> Transportation
> The U.S. Coast Guard collects Vessel Traffic Data, also known as Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which provides a dynamic picture of marine activity in the planning area. AIS devices transmit and continuously monitor vessel locations and characteristics in both U.S. and international waters. To facilitate this effort, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center have collaborated. They have repurposed and made accessible vital information sourced from the U.S. Coast Guard's extensive network of AIS receivers. These data include details like vessel location, time, vessel type, speed, dimensions (length, beam), and draft. The map below shows general ship activity, and several of the sections below show the activity of specific ship types.
> Figure 3. Ship and boat activity across the planning area in 2022, along with major administrative features related to ship movements: the marine highways, navigation channels, and the regulated navigation area (covering the entire Bay).
> 
> 
> Shipping
> Delaware marine waters support a range of shipping activities, among which are coastal freight transport, deep sea freight transport, and tanker operations. Coastal freight transport often revolves around the carriage of domestic goods such as food items, construction materials, and machinery. The scope of deep-sea freight transport, on the other hand, encompasses transoceanic operations, often ferrying heavyweight, bulky items, and containers globally. Coastal freight enterprises employ about 35 people annually, while deep-sea enterprises employ about 100 (See Appendix Table S1). Despite this small group, almost 1600 cargo ships entered Delaware waters in 2022.

> Figure 5. Timing of cargo ship activity during 2022. Counts refer to the number of ships observed each day.
> 
> 
> 
> Tanker ships operations largely focus on the movement of liquid bulk materials, typically comprising chemicals, crude oil, or liquefied natural gas. While a smaller number of these vessels were observed in comparison to cargo ships—approximately 588 in 2022 (see Appendix Table S2)—they remain integral in facilitation of international trade. It bears noting that hazardous contents are occasionally transported in both cargo and tanker vessels, underscoring the importance of diligent oversight and proper safety measures. While 40% of cargo ships and 25% of tanker ships simply pass through Delaware waters, the majority still enter the Delaware Bay, demonstrating the undeniable stature of Delaware as a principal maritime hub.

> Passenger Transportation
> Delaware’s passenger transportation is significantly shaped by the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, facilitating the transport of over a quarter of a million cars and three-quarters of a million people annually (Chmael, Shuman, and Webster 2020). This vital transportation link promotes tourism, trade, and economic development. An economic impact study reveals that every dollar spent on the Ferry System generates twenty dollars of economic activity, highlighting its substantial contribution to the local economy. Monthly passenger surveys conducted since 2015 demonstrate the financial impact of ferry passengers, with an estimated minimum annual spending of $125 million at Delaware Beaches and $144 million at South Jersey Shore towns. The surveys also indicate that almost all passengers make stops in the area, emphasizing the Ferry System’s role in stimulating local businesses and driving economic growth. Beyond the Ferry, there are also passenger ships that transit through Delaware’s waters (about 42% of observed ships, see Appendix Table S2). However, there are only two enterprises dedicated to deep sea passenger transportation in Delaware.

> Navigation Services
> “Navigation Services” within Delaware marine waters embrace a suite of activities, ensuring fluidity and safety within the maritime ecosystem. Shipping Navigational Services employed an average of 90 individuals in Delaware across 10 establishments annually between 2011 and 2019. Their pivotal role is supplemented by the use of approximately 6,300 tow boats and 400 other navigation boats each year. These vessels facilitate the movement of ships, ensuring their safe navigation through Delaware’s waterways. Maritime Pilots play a critical role in guiding vessels in and out of port areas, leveraging their local knowledge, while port maintenance teams diligently work to maintain and improve the maritime infrastructure. Towing and Tugboats further contribute to the smooth operation of the port, assisting in docking, undocking, and rescuing disabled ships.

> Marine Highways
> Delaware’s marine highways play a crucial role in fostering sustainable and efficient transportation systems, reducing the environmental impact of freight logistics, and addressing congestion challenges in various regions.There are several marine highways in the project area; Delaware Bay, Atlantic Deep Water Acces, and Atlantic Deep Water Spine. One of the main goal of these designated highways is that, to reduce congestion and ensure efficient marine transportation. 
> Regulated Navigation Area
> The Delaware Port Authority has declared the region encompassing the Wilmington Port, including its entrance, as a Regulated Navigation Area (RNA). This designated RNA encompasses the Delaware Bay and River, Salem River, Christiana River, and Schuylkill River. Within this area, there is a specific restriction: vessels with a draft of 55 feet or more are prohibited from entering.
> Operations
> Emergency Services
> Emergency services in Delaware’s marine waters encompass an array of search and rescue operations and law enforcement actions catered towards preserving life, enforcing maritime laws, and providing safety to all maritime stakeholders. Search and rescue missions are often spurred by distress incidents and may involve operations like locating and assisting boats, recovering individuals from the water, or coordinating rescue efforts during severe weather events. During 2022, 6 boats were observed dedicated to these activities, with their efforts dominantly stationed in the upper Bay. Law enforcement actions revolve around ensuring adherence to maritime rules and regulations, monitoring fishing activities, combating illegal activities such as smuggling or illicit fishing, and maintaining general order in the waters.

> 
> Dredging and Underwater Operations
> Dredging operations in Delaware’s marine waters, concentrated largely in the upper Bay, form a crucial part of the state’s maritime industry. In 2022, 6 ships were observed to be involved in these operations, with activity throughout the year but concentrated in the summer months. These operations primarily serve two essential purposes: the maintenance of navigation channels and beach nourishment. The process of dredging involves the removal of sediment from the sea floor. This serves several beneficial uses, not only maintaining navigation channels for maritime traffic, but also providing a cost-effective resource for another critical coastal issue: beach erosion. Sediments harvested from dredging operations can be strategically redistributed onto eroding beaches, turning what would be waste materials into a valuable resource for supporting tourism and natural habitats.

> Military Operations
> Military operations occur within the planning area within the VACAPES OPAREA, close to the shoreline, and the Atlantic City OPAREA, situated further out to sea. These Operating Areas (OPAREAs) are official zones in which national defense exercises and system qualification tests are conducted routinely, with boundaries sanctioned both nationally and internationally. These areas provide a secure environment for the coordination of defense activities involving federal, state, and local agencies while also ensuring the general public’s welfare through mechanisms such as the Local Notice to Mariners. South of the planning area, there is an area devoted to ship shock trials. Interestingly, this area was recently shifted further out to sea to ensure a 5 NM buffer from the Mid-Atlantic Planning Awareness Area (PAA) as part of a commitment to minimize potential impacts on marine wildlife following a consultation period governed by the National Marine Fisheries Service under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

> Fishing
> Commercial Fishing
> Between 2011 and 2020, the average commercial fisheries landing was about 4.9 million lbs., with a minimum of 3.5 million lbs., and a maximum of 6 million lbs. This resulted in an average total revenue of $9.1 million annually, fluctuating between $6.8 and $11.8 million. Finfish accounted for an average of 398,000 lbs. ($676,000 of revenue), while shellfish and other categories accounted for a much larger average of 4.5 million lbs. ($8.4 million of revenue). Key species included in this activity are the blue crab, with an average landing of 3.5 million lbs. ($6.5 million in revenue), and the eastern oyster, black sea bass, and knobbed whelk amongst others. Commercial fishing activity in Delaware marine waters relies on technology such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS), Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and Vessel Trip Reports (VTR) to measure catch and fishing activity. About 2000 fishing boats are observed in the planning region each year.

> Benthic Gear Commercial Fishing
> Benthic Gear practice of fishing, which involves employing seafloor-contacting gear, is a widespread and vital aspect of commercial fishing. Within this context, an array of valuable species is targeted, encompassing the likes of Striped Bass, Quahog Clams, Blue Crabs, American Eels, Eastern Oysters, Sea Scallops, Black Sea Bass, Spot, Weakfish, and Whelks.

> Pelagic Gear Commercial Fishing
> In the waters of Delaware, pelagic gear commercial fishing plays a significant role in the maritime industry. This method involves the use of specialized equipment designed for open-water fishing, primarily targeting pelagic species that inhabit the vast expanses of the sea rather than the seafloor. Commonly pursued species in this context include Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic menhaden, and various species of tuna such as bluefin and yellowfin.
> Recreational Fishing
> Recreational Fishing in Delaware refers to the practice of catching a variety of different fish species in Delaware’s waters for non-commercial purposes, or essentially, for fun, sport, or self-sustenance. Commonly caught species include, but are not limited to, bluefish, Atlantic croaker, summer flounder, black sea bass, tautog, catfish, drums, and tunas.
> 
> From 2011 to 2020, Delaware’s marine recreational fishing involved an average of 216,000 anglers annually, with a majority (125,000) coming from out-of-state. As detailed in Table 2, the popularity of these events fluctuated over the years with both in-state and out-of-state participation reaching a minimum of 64,000 and 69,000 and maximums of 129,000 and 190,000, respectively. Shore fishing was the most popular, accounting for around 1.48 million trips, followed by private boating with approximately 788,000 trips. Atlantic croaker was the most commonly harvested species (average of 230 thousand fish), while summer flounder and bluefish were also popular targets (see Table 3). Tautog and black sea bass were notable for both their harvest and release numbers.

> Fish hatcheries
> Fish hatcheries in Delaware play a vital role in the preservation and promotion of fish species for both conservation and recreational purposes. These facilities are crucial for maintaining fish populations, enhancing aquatic biodiversity, and serve as educational hubs, raising awareness about fisheries conservation and effective ecosystem management. Operated by the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife, these hatcheries produce fingerlings and juvenile fish, contributing significantly to sustainable fisheries and bolstering recreational angling opportunities. These hatcheries are strategically located along the coastline, strategically positioned to fulfill their essential functions.
> Recreation and Tourism
> Recreational activities engage locals and visitors alike. According to the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Recreation Survey, the majority enjoy shore-based activities, with beach going being the most popular (92.9%), and the collection of non-living resources such as beach glass, shells, fossils, and driftwood was also common (55.8%). A significant amount of people also participate in sight-seeing activities including photography (60.3%) and wildlife viewing (15.4%). At the water surface, kayaking, swimming, and surfing are common. Underwater activities, such as snorkeling and SCUBA diving are less frequent but still vital aspects of the marine recreational landscape. In terms of expenditure, respondents on average spent $46.94 per coastal visit. Additionally, Delaware waters host a significant number of sail boats and pleasure crafts, with over 3000 reported annually. The majority (75%) interact with the coast or the bay, while around a quarter pass through deeper waters.

> Water Trails
> Designated water trails serve as established routes for recreational boating and paddling. They function as valuable navigational guides for kayakers, canoeists, and boaters, facilitating their exploration of the area's waterways. These trails often wind through coastal regions, estuaries, bays, and inlets, offering a window into a wide range of ecosystems and picturesque landscapes. Water trails provide exceptional opportunities for outdoor recreation, wildlife observation, and cultural discovery, enabling enthusiasts to immerse themselves in both the natural beauty and historical significance of the Delaware Bay and the ocean. Delaware Seashore State Park, in particular, offers a diverse array of water trails tailored for kayaking and paddleboarding. Launch points like Tower Road, New Road, Savages Ditch, and Burton Island Causeway grant access to these trails, leading adventurers to scenic vantage points, tranquil marsh creeks, and historical remnants. 
> Conservation
> Artificial Reefs
> Delaware’s marine waters currently host 14 artificially engineered reefs, primarily located within the bay but with additional structures extending into more expansive, oceanic territories. These reefs, fashioned from a variety of materials including cleaned construction components, decommissioned boats, and retired subway cars, have been strategically placed to create new, stable habitats and expand opportunities for recreational fishing and diving. The artificial reef programs actively manage these sites, deploying materials like rocks and concrete to certain locations, such as Delaware Bay Sites 4, 6, and 7 (shown in brown on figure below), and communicating their placement to anglers. This communication is critical, given that the financing for reef development is primarily sourced from angler and boater excise taxes—a key part of federal aid projects. The established reefs offer an enhanced hard bottom habitat, quickly colonized by sessile organisms, expanding food sources, protection of juvenile fish by offering more refuge space, and a potential nucleus for adults to spawn. Consequently, artificial reefs have significantly altered underwater landscapes and ecosystems, with data being collected through diverse methods, including state documentation, communication with state and NOAA representatives, and broader internet-based research.
> 
> Figure 41. Location of artificial reefs, with rock deployment, high points, and site polygons further highlighted.

> 
> Beach Nourishment
> Beach nourishment, an essential component of coastal management, involves the replenishing of eroded beaches with sand from various sources: inland locales, dredged navigational channels, or offshore sites. Delaware has witnessed a continuous series of such projects dotting its coast while also noting a lesser representation on the shores of its bay. This data is part of a comprehensive set encapsulating over 2,000 episodes of beach nourishment from 1923 to 2019, comprising the historical data collated by Western Carolina University Beach Nourishment Viewer database and the National Beach Nourishment Database generated by the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association. The dataset provides information on sand placements and volume, tracking the length of nourished beach, reporting the cost of each venture, and identifying primary funding sources and types—whether private, federal, or state-funded. For more detail on the sources of sand used in these nourishment projects, see the sections on Dredging and Underwater Operations and Mining Sand Resources.
> 
> Figure 42. Beach nourishment projects. Each circle is sized by the scale of sand used, and colored according to the year of the project.

> 
> Beach and Dune Preservation
> The 1972 Beach Preservation Act (7 Del. C. Chapter 68) provides the authority to DNREC to enhance, preserve, and protect the beaches in the state so they can be shared and enjoyed by all. The current status of beach and dune preservation in Delaware involves a combination of erosion control measures, dune stabilization initiatives, and responsible coastal development guidelines. Regular monitoring helps assess the health and condition of beach and dune systems, providing valuable data for future preservation strategies [1]
> Coastal habitat restoration
> The board category habitats in the coastal water of Delaware inlcudes Unconsolidated Shore (sand, gravel, cobble), Unconsolidated Shore (mud, organic, flat), Scrub-Shrub, Forested, and Emergent Marsh. The preservation and enhancement of coastal ecosystems, including salt marshes, tidal wetlands, and seagrass beds, through habitat restoration, are crucial components of conservation initiatives aimed at safeguarding Delaware's beaches. Initiatives encompass the removal of invasive species, the reintroduction of native flora, enhancements in water quality, and the promotion of responsible beach utilization. These restoration endeavors are geared towards safeguarding biodiversity, ameliorating water quality, bolstering sediment stability, and fortifying the resilience of coastal ecosystems. 
> Special Management Zone Areas 
> Special Management Zone Areas are designated by the NOAA Fisheries Service's Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO). These zones encompass the following regulated areas: Delaware Artificial Reefs: #9, #10, #11, and #13.
> Figure 43. Location of Special Management Zone Areas.
> 
> 
> Coastal Wildlife Conservation
> Coastal wildlife conservation is a vital endeavor dedicated to preserving the ecological richness of the unique ecosystem. The region serves as a critical habitat for a diverse range of species, including migratory birds, marine mammals, and various marine life. Key conservation efforts focus on protecting the horseshoe crab population, which is essential for the survival of migratory shorebirds like the red knot. Additionally, measures are in place to sustainably manage fish populations and safeguard vital marshlands and coastal habitats.
> Island Re-creation
> Island re-creation in the Delaware Bay and adjacent ocean areas involves restoration efforts to revitalize existing islands and establish new island habitats, primarily for ecological and recreational purposes. These projects include creating bird nesting islands with suitable materials and protective measures for avian species, as well as restoring salt marshes and wetlands on existing islands. These endeavors not only provide essential nesting and feeding grounds for various wildlife but also contribute to improved water quality and flood protection for coastal communities. Such initiatives not only enhance the ecological health of the region but also offer opportunities for recreational activities like birdwatching and wildlife observation, enriching the overall experience of this coastal environment.
> Salt Marsh Protection
> Salt Marsh Protection work revolves around the protection and preservation of crucial coastal ecosystems. It encompasses the establishment of conservation zones, the implementation of regulatory frameworks, the execution of restoration initiatives, public awareness campaigns, research endeavors, climate resilience planning, active community involvement, collaborative partnerships, economic assessments, forward-looking planning strategies, and advocacy for policy enhancements. Furthermore, these endeavors benefit from the legal safeguards provided by Section 6607 within the Wetlands Act of 1973 (7 Del.C. Ch. 66). Figure 44, produced from the dataset, shows the Estuarine and marine Wetlands are mostly salt marshes.

> Industrial activities
> Cooling water intake and discharge
> Cooling water intake is the process of extracting water from the Delaware Bay or the ocean to cool industrial machinery, such as power plants, by absorbing excess heat. Subsequently, this heated water is carefully released back into its source, with stringent regulations and safeguards in place to prevent any adverse effects on marine ecosystems. These protective measures include setting temperature thresholds, establishing designated mixing zones, and employing cutting-edge technologies to harmonize the demands of industrial operations with the imperative of environmental conservation. Currently in Delaware, these practices are executed and overseen through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
> Disposal Sites
> The planning area contains several ocean disposal sites, both active and deactivated. Two active disposal sites primarily are utilized as Littoral Placement Areas. These sites typically receive clean sediment dredged during navigation channel enhancement programs sponsored or regulated by federal and state authorities. Three discontinued disposal sites also exist in the planning area, with unknown uses. Nearby the planning area, there is a discontinued municipal sewage sludge dump site, signifying the disposal management of biosolids following wastewater treatment; and a dedicated site for the disposal of dredged material designated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). These sites collectively underline the different practices in ocean disposal within and around the Delaware marine waters.
>

> Submarine Pipelines
> The Delaware marine waters are home to a variety of coastal and underwater infrastructures. These include wastewater outfall pipes, located in the upper bay and along the coast, which discharge into surface waters. The region also has a network of submarine cables, both offshore and near the shore, with a 100-foot-wide right of way on each side. These cables are found in multiple areas, including the upper bay, near the mouth, and crossing the planning area in deeper waters. The offshore cables shown in the map below are communication cables, while some of the Bay cables are for power transmission.
> 
> Figure 46. Location of underwater pipe infrastructure. Submarine cable areas include the right of way around each cable.

> Scientific observation
> Scientific observation in Delaware’s marine waters serves a vital role in understanding the marine environment’s complexities as well as monitoring changes over time. This knowledge is crucial for advancing our techniques in managing marine resources, mitigating human impact on the marine biosphere, and securing long-term global sustainability.
> 
> Figure 47The map illustrates ocean observing assets near and around Delaware. These data-collection instruments are localited to monitor an assortment of physical parameters, providing invaluable information for our understanding of oceanic dynamics. These parameters typically include data related to surface and underwater currents, sea surface temperature, salinity profiles, wave heights, and potentially coastal meteorological data, among other variables. These sites constitute an essential part of our stewardship of marine environments and our efforts towards global sustainability.

> Planned Future Activities
> Wilmington Port Expansion
> The Diamond State Port Corp, responsible for managing the Port of Wilmington is pursuing an ambitious expansion plan. They are currently in the process of redeveloping the Chemours Edgemoor industrial site in Edgemoor, DE, in collaboration with Gulftainer, to establish a cutting-edge shipping container facility. The project involves the construction of a 112-foot wide by 2,600-foot long wharf, deepening the berth and access channel to 45 feet below mean low water, and the installation of 3,200 feet of bulkhead along the shoreline. Upon completion, this expansion will significantly boost the port's capacity, providing storage for up to 1.2 million container slots, including over 4,000 refrigerated slots. The need for this expansion arises from the port's unprecedented growth, with record-breaking business and a surge in incoming vessels.
> Wind Power
> Delaware’s Offshore Wind Farm, currently in its early planning stages, is poised to transform the utilization of Delaware’s rich wind resources into clean, renewable energy. Comprising offshore wind planning zones and lease areas, along with a detailed wind speed assessment, the project foresees the installation of wind turbines and a wind substation, forming part of the broader sustainable strategy aimed at combating climate change.
> 
> The map below shows a rough estimate of wind potential, assuming that turbines can produce 4 MW at winds of 8 m/s.
> 
> Figure 49. Approximate wind energy potential, in terms of MW per km2, assuming 1 km spacing between turbines.
> 
> 
> 
> Offshore wind farming involves the complex process of constructing and installing wind turbines in bodies of water to harness wind energy for electricity generation. The turbines, generally more substantial in size than their land-based counterparts, take advantage of correspondingly higher and more consistent wind speeds at sea. The generated power then reaches the shore via undersea transmission cables, greatly minimizing visual impact and contributing to a more sustainable energy future.
> 
> Regulatory oversight of these projects spans various agency levels, including federal bodies like the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and state-level organizations such as the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). BOEM provides leasing, plan approval, and ongoing project oversight, while DNREC will ensure the projects align with state-specific environmental and coastal management policies.
> 
> Delaware’s proximity to the Central Atlantic Wind Energy Areas, a region identified for offshore wind energy development, offers significant potential for expanded wind projects and cross-state collaboration. However, this potential also brings challenges in harmoniously integrating wind power activities with existing ocean usage, especially concerning fisheries, wildlife, and tourism.
> 
> Recent research underscores the importance of minimizing conflict and enhancing engagement with coastal communities and fisheries in offshore wind projects. Meaningful inclusion of fisheries representatives in planning, decision-making processes, and developments in understanding the cumulative exposure of wildlife to offshore wind farms all play an important role in promoting sustainable coexistence (Haggett et al. 2020; Goodale and Milman 2019). Equally critical is the consideration of ‘distributive fairness’ in renewable energy advancements; the benefits – such as jobs, economic growth, and profits – should not bypass the coastal communities nearest to wind energy developments (Bidwell, Firestone, and Ferguson 2022).
> 
> Figure 50. Location of planning areas and proposed infrastructure for wind projects.
> 
> 
> Offshore Landings
> Offshore wind landing refers to the process of siting and constructing wind turbines in aquatic environments such as oceans or lakes, with the goal of harnessing wind energy for electricity generation. Offshore wind farms offer several advantages, including the availability of higher and more consistent wind speeds, reduced visual impact, and the potential for larger turbine installations. This contributes to the growth of sustainable and renewable energy sources. In the dataset, two proposed offshore wind landing locations are identified for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project by the US wind Inc. 
> Potential Future Activities
> Mining Sand Resources
> The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides leases which allow entities to dredge sand, gravel, or shell resources from the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. Such resources may be used for “(1) a project for shore protection, beach restoration, or coastal restoration undertaken by a Federal, State, or local government agency; or (2) for use in a construction project funded in whole or in part by, or authorized by, the Federal government”. Currently, no active or proposed leases exist within the planning area. However, potential regions with sand resources do exist in the planning region, as shown below.
> 
> Figure 51. Location of surveyed sand resources.
> 
> 
> Atlantic OCS Sand Resources, Borrow Locations, limestone, gravel
> Within the expanse of the Outer Continental Shelf, specific zones are dedicated to the extraction of sand resources, primarily to facilitate beach nourishment and bolster coastal protection efforts. These earmarked regions also serve as operational hubs for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), where ongoing dredging activities are conducted to replenish essential sand resources, effectively combating beach erosion. Furthermore, certain areas on this continental shelf feature limestone, a valuable material extensively used in construction and integral to cement production. In parallel, sand and gravel, sourced from these offshore locales, play pivotal roles in the creation of concrete, as well as in the construction of roads and a multitude of landscaping projects, underpinning various facets of infrastructure development and environmental enhancement. Eight sand resource zones exist within the planning area, featuring both ongoing activity at known locations and potential future sites identified. The extraction of sand, overseen by regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, adheres to responsible sourcing practices that aim to strike a balance between environmental conservation and the imperative requirement for beach replenishment.
> Offshore Oil and Gas
> Significant oil and gas reserves may be tapped on the continental slope at the edge of the planning area. These are part of a large geologic play across the North Atlantic, which is estimated to have 1.9 billion barrels of oil (Bbo) and 11.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (Tcfg), totalling 3.9 Bbo of energy-equivalent barrels [90% CI 0.1 - 13.1 Bbo] (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management 2021). As the map below shows, a number of exploratory wells (now all plugged and abandoned) have been drilled across the region. However, currently no active leases or active oil or gas platforms are in the planning area. If active extraction occurs, there might also be a demand for deepwater port facilities, such as those that exist off the coasts of Massachusetts and Louisiana, to provide points of exchange, storage, and services for oil and gas.
> 
> Figure 52. Location of test wells (purple), estimated oil and gas potential, in terms of billions of energy-equivalent barrels across large plays. Also shows the oil and gas planning areas, of which the planning area contains two.
> 
> 
> Offshore Wave Energy
> Wave energy refers to the capture of energy from wind waves to perform useful work, including electricity generation, water desalination, or water pumping. The concept involves utilizing a significant yet underexploited source of renewable energy to achieve sustainability aims. In the US, the implementation of this concept in actuality is still sparse with just one marine hydrokinetic lease and planning area, headed by PacWave in Oregon. Delaware, on the other hand, is a region that does not provide high levels of wave energy potential, but its potential levelized cost might be low enough to outbalance this restriction. The Waveline Magnet, developed by a UK-based company, stands testament to this concept, boasting a levelized cost of electricity as low as £0.01/kWh while demanding minuscule levels of maintenance. Indeed, wave energy holds great potential, with some areas even recording wave energy levels surpassing 7 kW/m. As such, while Delaware may not have very high wave energy potential, the cost-effective and sustainable use of even low potentials could pave the way to a renewable future.
> Figure 53. Estimated wave potential, in terms of kilowatts per meter of wave crest.
> 
> 
> Marine Protection
> Delaware marine waters currently feature diverse protective measures by various entities, yet show significant room for expansion and improvement. The area notably contains a large Coral Protection Area, designed to guard deep-sea coral from the physical damage caused by certain fishing gear, with boundaries extending beyond the continental shelf. However, there are no Marine National Monuments or National Marine Sanctuaries to showcase the area’s historical and ecological significance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges provide further protection, dedicating large terrestrial and estuary parcels, but no land has been set aside for exclusive marine protection. The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve, a Category IV MPA according to IUCN, is the only substantial water-body reserve within ProtectedPlanet’s records. But, even this area lacks a corresponding no-take zone. The current protections are important, but it is evident that the untapped potential for marine protection in Delaware’s waters is immense.
> 
> Figure 54. Protected areas of various types (coral protection, NWRS marine protected areas, and marine and terrestrial protected areas).
> 
> 
> Aquaculture
> No aquaculture operations are active within the marine planning area. However, it is worth noting the existence of aquaculture operations in the nearby New Jersey side of the Bay. This sector encompasses a variety of aquatic organisms including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic plants. In addition, regulated Shellfish Aquaculture Development Areas (SADA) demarcated within the inland bay vicinity, divided into individual plots. These areas are earmarked due to their expedited state and federal permitting processes, that potentially makes them conducive to and expedient for future aquaculture expansion.
> Oyster Aquaculture
> Oyster aquaculture along Delaware's shoreline not only fosters economic prospects but also yields environmental advantages while playing a pivotal role in rejuvenating oyster populations and enhancing the health of coastal ecosystems. With the growing demand for seafood, the oyster farming community in Delaware is experiencing a decline in numbers.
> Other Shellfish Farming
> Cultivation of other shellfish species, which includes not only oysters but also an array of other valuable marine life such as clams (both hard and soft varieties), mussels, scallops, crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. Clams, in particular, flourish in intertidal and subtidal zones and are commonly utilized in a diverse range of culinary dishes.
