**assistant**:
> The length of a circle that is part of a wedge is called an arc. Specifically, the arc is the curved portion of the circle that forms the boundary of the wedge. The length of the arc is often measured in radians or degrees, depending on the context.

**assistant**:
> Yes, the length of an arc is called its arc length. The arc length is the distance along the curved line that makes up the arc, and it is measured in units such as centimeters, meters, or feet. The arc length can be calculated using the formula:

> Arc Length = (θ/360) × 2πr

> where θ is the central angle of the arc in degrees, r is the radius of the circle that the arc is part of, and 2πr is the circumference of the circle. This formula gives the length of the arc in terms of the radius and central angle, which are two properties that define the arc.
