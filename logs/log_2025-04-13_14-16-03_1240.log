> What do you call a scorpions poisonous stinger?
**assistant**:
> A scorpion's poisonous stinger is part of its "telson," which is the last segment of its tail. The stinger delivers venom and is used for hunting prey and self-defense.
**user**:
> Is there a term for a barb like that generally, the way you call venomous teeth fangs?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the general term for a barb or stinger used to inject venom is "sting." While "fang" specifically refers to the elongated teeth of venomous animals, "sting" encompasses various structures, including those of scorpions, wasps, and certain fish. If you want to refer to any similar structure more broadly, "venomous appendage" could also work.
