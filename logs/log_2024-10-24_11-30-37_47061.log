> What is the inverse of a CRRA utility function?
**assistant**:
> The Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function is typically expressed as:
> 
> \[ U(c) = \frac{c^{1-\theta} - 1}{1-\theta} \]
> 
> for \(\theta \neq 1\), where \(c\) is consumption and \(\theta\) is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. When \(\theta = 1\), it simplifies to the log utility, \( U(c) = \log(c) \).
> 
> To find the inverse of a CRRA utility function, solve for \(c\) as a function of utility \(U\):
> 
> 1. **For \(\theta \neq 1\):**
> 
>    Starting with:
> 
>    \[
>    U(c) = \frac{c^{1-\theta} - 1}{1-\theta}
>    \]
> 
>    Rearranging gives:
> 
>    \[
>    U(c)(1-\theta) + 1 = c^{1-\theta}
>    \]
> 
>    Then, solving for \(c\), we get:
> 
>    \[
>    c = \left(U(c)(1-\theta) + 1\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\theta}}
>    \]
> 
> 2. **For \(\theta = 1\) (log utility):**
> 
>    \[
>    U(c) = \log(c)
>    \]
> 
>    Then:
> 
>    \[
>    c = e^{U(c)}
>    \]
> 
> Thus, these are the inverses of the CRRA utility functions for the different cases of \(\theta\). Let me know if you need more detailed explanations or any other related calculations!
