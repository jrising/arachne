**assistant**:
> In Python 3, you have a few methods to insert variables into a string. Here are three common ways:
> 
> 1. **The `f-string` method**, or formatted string literals (Python 3.6+):
> ```python
> name = "James"
> age = 45
> print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
> ```
> 
> 2. **The `str.format()` method**:
> ```python
> name = "James"
> age = 45
> print("Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
> ```
> 
> 3. **The `%` operator**, or string formatting operator:
> ```python
> name = "James"
> age = 45
> print("Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
> ```
> 
> In all of these examples, the output will be: `Hello, my name is James and I am 45 years old.`
> 
> Among these, the `f-string` method is typically the most readable and convenient when you're using Python 3.6 or later.
