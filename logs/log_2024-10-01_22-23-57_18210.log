> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> 
> I recently read your papers “Challenges and innovations in the economic evaluation of the risks of climate change”, as well as “The missing risks of climate change” and delved into your research on climate change economics. I am very interested and inspired by your approaches and research methods, particularly on economic evaluation and climate change damage.
> 
> I will be applying to PhD programs and I was wondering if you will have any PhD openings in your lab.
> 
> In my case, my passion for environmental economics and policy and sustainable urbanization stems from a personal experience. In 2020, my home in Euboea, Greece was tragically ravaged by the "Thalia" storm and the devastating flooding (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53714286). Witnessing the destruction of my home and the suffering of my community firsthand fueled my determination to pursue an academic career dedicated to addressing environmental challenges.
> 
> As far as my academic background, I'll be graduating this November with honors, holding two Master’s in Public Economics and Policy (Thesis: “Combating Climate Change: An Evaluation of Municipal Plans in Greece’s most Densely Populated Regional Unit”), as well as New Technologies in Shipping and Transport (Thesis: “Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Use of Renewable Fuels in Shipping”) and a BSc in Economics and Regional Development.
> 
> I worked as a research assistant throughout my Master’s studies and I am currently working to publish my thesis as a scientific paper in several journals. Notably, my thesis was recognized by the committee as the first plan quality evaluation for municipal climate change plans in Greece.
> 
> My primary research interests are focused on environmental policy and economic evaluation. My vision for my PhD dissertation involves assessing the effectiveness of carbon pricing, renewable energy subsidies, and energy efficiency standards in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in regions vulnerable to floods and environmental hazards. 
> 
> Additionally, I plan to evaluate the trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection within the suggested case studies. This will involve examining the potential costs and benefits of climate action, including impacts on GDP, employment, and energy security.
> 
> If possible, I would be also interested in utilizing the Computational General Equilibrium economic modeling to simulate the economic effects of floods. I intend to estimate those effects by modeling the destruction of infrastructure, changes in consumption patterns and loss of productivity. At the same time, I would like to analyze the long-term effects of climate change in those hazard-prone areas by modeling changes in agricultural productivity, rising sea levels and increased energy costs.
> 
> Moreover, I envision applying an additional methodology, similar to my Master’s thesis by evaluating their existing public plans through content analysis, using a four-point scale and quantitative/qualitative indicators. 
> 
> Finally, I aim to identify the barriers that hinder effective national cooperation on decarbonization, energy security and climate change adaptation and propose potential solutions.
> 
> Attached to this message you can find my resume for your consideration. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss further about our shared academic interests and about open positions in your lab.
