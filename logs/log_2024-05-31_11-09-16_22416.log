> A recent surge of research has developed empirical relationships that describe how economic growth is impacted by variation in weather. We provide a first meta-analysis of these divergent results, drawing upon 58 statistical models from 8 key papers. We use machine learning to develop a “best-estimate” of the impact of weather, finding that global, population-weighted growth rates were X% lower between 2014 and 2023 due to existing climate change. We then combine this with other major dynamics by which climate change drives losses in income levels: persistence of damages, sea-level rise, trade spill-overs, and additional capital loss. Combined, these suggest that the average person is Y% poorer today than they would have been in the absence of climate change, with the greatest losses in poor, tropical countries. Since 1992, these cumulative losses across low and middle-income countries total $Z, with an additional loss of $A per year.

**user**:
> By a declarative statement, I mean something like "Synthesis of evidence on market losses from climate change reveals significant inequalities".
**assistant**:
> Got it! Here's a punchy, declarative title inspired by your example:
> 
> **"Global Economic Inequalities Amplified: Climate Change's Costly Toll Revealed"**
> 
> This title encapsulates the essence of your study and highlights the significant inequalities in economic impacts driven by climate change.
