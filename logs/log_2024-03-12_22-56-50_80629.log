**user**:
> Approximately how long would temperatures remain elevated above pre-industrial levels, if all CO$_2$ emissions stop today?
**assistant**:
> If all anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions stopped today, the existing CO$_2$ would continue to remain in the atmosphere. It would take many centuries, and even millennia, for it to be fully removed naturally by geological processes. As a result, Earth’s average global temperature would also remain elevated for a similar long period.
> 
> Approximately 50% of a CO$_2$ pulse to the atmosphere is removed within 30 years, and about 70% is eliminated within a century. However, approximately 15 to 40% of emitted CO$_2$ remains in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years.
> 
> This persistent elevated temperature, even with no further emissions, is due to the long timescales on which the oceans absorb heat and on which the carbon cycle operates. This leads to a committed warming, where temperature peaks within a decade of the emissions pulse, and then declines by only a few tenths of a degree over the next millennium.
> 
> This also assumes no tipping points are passed which could potentially lead to additional emissions (e.g., permafrost thawing). And it applies to CO$_2$ specifically—not emissions of other greenhouse gases, which can have different lifetimes and warming impacts.
> 
> In addition to the warming from CO$_2$, the immediate cessation of all emissions means an immediate cessation of aerosol emissions. Because aerosols can have a cooling influence, a sudden stop in their production could lead to a temporary, rapid increase in temperature.
> 
> In conclusion, even if we stop all CO$_2$ emissions today, it could take many centuries or millennia before temperatures return to pre-industrial levels. As such, solutions to climate change require a combination of emissions reductions, carbon capture, and potentially, geoengineering to actively cool the Earth. However, each of these strategies has its own challenges and risks.
**user**:
> Approximately how long would temperatures continue to climb, if all CO$_2$ emissions stop today?
**assistant**:
> If all CO$_2$ emissions were to suddenly cease today, temperatures would not immediately stabilize or decline. In fact, temperatures would continue to rise for a period of time before eventually stabilizing. This is due to the concept known as "committed warming" or "warming in the pipeline."
> 
> The Earth's climate system responds with a time delay to the increased levels of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. Even if emissions were to stop immediately, the oceans, which store a large amount of heat, would continue to release heat into the atmosphere for a period of time. Additionally, the ice-albedo feedback and other delayed feedback mechanisms would continue to contribute to further warming.
> 
> Estimates vary, but it is generally agreed that there would be a continued warming trend for several decades to centuries even after emissions stop. The exact duration and extent of this continued warming would depend on various factors, including the amount of CO$_2$ already in the atmosphere, the response of the oceans and ice masses, and feedback mechanisms in the climate system.
> 
> It's important to note that this continued warming highlights the importance of taking proactive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. Even if we were to stop emissions today, the impacts of past and present emissions would still be felt for an extended period, underscoring the urgency of mitigating climate change.
