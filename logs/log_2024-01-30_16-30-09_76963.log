**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Jurisdictions and Regulated Areas” as a data gap. Here is the discussion in NOAA 2018:

> Data Issues or Needed Improvements:
>  							
> Authoritative Areas: These are legal boundaries defined by Acts, CFR, etc. The legal descriptions were likely derived from spatial data but the spatial data are not published. Marine Cadastre is reconstructing and/or updating spatial data from the descriptions, which is not efficient. The spatial data should be published by the authoritative agency along with the legal descriptions.
>  							
> Tribal Areas of Interest, Sovereignty, and Treaty Boundaries: Tribal areas of interest or sovereignty in ocean areas are needed. Additionally, certain water uses by the states are governed by treaties with Tribes. Better data on the geospatial areas covered, duration, and regulatory restrictions of the agreements is needed.

> DoD Boundary Data: No-development areas are identified by the USCG and the Department of Defense (DoD) as areas where development is restricted. Currently data are only provided on an as-needed basis, which makes siting new facilities difficult. The military does not want to release data without clear need and the renewable energy sector does not want to spend time researching areas that are already off-limits. Data for other DoD restricted areas, active training grounds, proposed training grounds, WWII dump sites, and unexploded ordnance are also needed. DoD EISs may have some information on training grounds. The available data on unexploded ordnance areas show large polygons but no information on density; speculation is that DoD may have more detailed information but is not making it available and wants to provide broad area information only. The Marine Cadastre layer showing unexploded ordnance does not cover needed Pacific Island areas. The University of HI started some work on unused ordnance; typically these are small objects in deep water. Additionally, DoD data are also needed for coordination work regarding Great Lakes sanctuaries.
> 					
> USACE Permits: The Rivers and Harbors Act requires USACE authorization of modification to a navigable water (e.g., dredging) or construction of any structure that affects a navigable water of the U.S. The USACE publishes information in documents, notices, and narratives, but not as geospatial data. Place names and/or coordinates have to be keyed in to create spatial data. Geospatial data, updated monthly if possible, are needed instead from USACE. Information about planned, proposed, and approved projects is needed.
> 					
> USACE permitted shore based construction has the possibility of affecting the coastline from which the territorial sea and other boundaries are measured. NOAA and BOEM should be informed whenever a proposed construction project may affect the coastline (baseline). (Note: this is actually codified but not practiced)
> 					
> In order to address this need, a threshold for project size and project type may need to be established. The USACE permits numerous projects, but some are quite minimal. Relevant project types may include cables, pipelines, aquaculture sites, DOE pilot projects with EISs, offshore wind lease or wind energy projects (BOEM), and ocean disposal sites.
> 					
> USACE Permanent Aquaculture Sites: USACE maintains outlines for permanent aquaculture sites, but the data have to be pieced together by the regions or Marine Cadastre. Again, the responsible agency should publish the data in a geospatial format.
> 					
> Ocean Disposal Sites: USACE and EPA regulate these areas. Data on designated sites and retired sites are needed. Data quality issues have been seen with the currently available data. The agencies appear to manage their data on a permit by permit basis, not in an enterprise system. The region(s) are forced to dig through the individual permit documents to piece together information. Marine Cadastre did the first nationwide product which is updated annually, but the regions need up to date data with additional details for individual sites. The managing agencies could do a better job of providing useful geospatial data. Any data updates done at the regions are provided back to Marine Cadastre for inclusion in the national data set.
> 					
> Designated Anchorages and Pilot Boarding Areas: These data are managed by the USGC. Thousands of anchorages exist and the rate of change is low, but the data appear to be managed by district offices only, not agency-wide. Marine Cadastre updates the national data set annually but that is not sufficient for some uses. Updating the existing data set requires reading the CFR and digitizing the boundary from the description. The agency should send weekly or monthly updates in a geospatial format.
> 					
> Fishery Management Areas: These areas are needed for permitting and fisheries management. Often the data are confusing as to where and/or why they are changing (i.e. is the change regulatory or due to an ecosystem concern).

> Can you summarize this material, citing these sources, with a view toward data gaps relevant to Delaware’s planning process?
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can help with that. Here is a summary of the information from the NOAA 2018 report and the Trice et al. 2021 piece, focusing on jurisdictions and regulated areas data gaps, specifically written in the context of Delaware's planning process:
> 
> ---
> 
> Significant data gaps exist concerning jurisdictional and regulated areas within the Delaware ocean and bay, which can hinder spatial planning processes (NOAA 2018; Trice et al. 2021).
> 
> Firstly, data about the legal boundaries, such as those defined by Acts, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and tribal boundaries of interest, are not readily available in a usable spatial format. These data, which are critical for planning activities like offshore aquaculture siting, offshore renewable energy sites, and species and habitat management, among others, are usually published as documents rather than geospatial data. This information deficit calls for the original data-creating agencies to publish these data in geospatial forms, not just textual descriptions (NOAA 2018; Trice et al. 2021).
> 
> Secondly, relevant data about the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) permits and regulations like modification of navigable water, construction activities that can affect navigable water, and permanent aquaculture sites, are often encapsulated in narrative documents rather than featuring as accessible geospatial data. Lack of monthly geospatial updates on planned, proposed, and approved projects led by USACE adds to the data crunch (NOAA 2018). 
> 
> Thirdly, data about Department of Defense (DoD) boundaries—such as no-development areas, active training grounds, proposed training grounds, and unexploded ordnance areas—are often only provided on an as-needed basis, making planning for new infrastructure difficult. There is a call for more detailed data about these military areas, as opposed to broad areas of restriction (NOAA 2018; Trice et al. 2021).
> 
> Another area of data gaps revolves around Ocean Disposal Sites, regulated by the EPA and USACE. The current data architecture appears to be managed on a permit-by-permit basis, rather than an integrated enterprise system, which creates quality issues (NOAA 2018).
> 
> Lastly, fishery management areas, designated anchorages, and pilot boarding areas are poorly managed. The rate of change is quite low for these areas, but the data are either confusing or not centrally managed by agency-wide mechanisms, leading to underutilization (NOAA 2018).
> 
> In summary, the data gaps in Jurisdictions and Regulated Areas are hindering Delaware’s planning process for sustainable activities in its ocean and bay. The need for authoritative agencies to produce and maintain geospatial data alongside traditional documentation is a key takeaway from the discussions in these two reports (NOAA 2018; Trice et al. 2021).
