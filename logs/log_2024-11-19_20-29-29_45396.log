>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)

>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
>    prospective students.
>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &
