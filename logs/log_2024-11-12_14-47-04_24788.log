> Which of these has the greatest potential for long-term change? I tend to be skeptical of relief services, since they're not setting people up to be better off the next time.
**assistant**:
> Your skepticism towards relief services is valid, as many focus on immediate needs rather than long-term solutions. Here are a few organizations from your list that have strong potential for long-term change by addressing root causes:
> 
> 1. **International Rescue Committee (IRC)**: The IRC doesn’t just provide emergency relief; it also focuses on integration and empowerment by helping refugees gain skills, find employment, and access education. This holistic approach means they work towards the long-term stability and independence of vulnerable populations.
> 
> 2. **Habitat for Humanity**: Beyond building homes, Habitat for Humanity helps families attain home ownership, which is a critical factor in long-term economic stability. They also emphasize sustainable building practices, which contribute to long-lasting community resilience and environmental sustainability.
> 
> 3. **Equal Justice Initiative**: By addressing systemic issues within the justice system—such as mass incarceration and racial inequality—EJI works to create lasting legislative and social changes. Their focus on education and advocacy aims to reform policies that contribute to cycles of poverty and disadvantage.
> 
> 4. **NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund**: This organization works on civil rights issues, including education equity, which can lead to long-term socioeconomic improvement. They strive to impact systemic racism within legal structures, seeking sustainable changes that empower marginalized communities.
> 
> 5. **United Negro College Fund (UNCF)**: By providing scholarships and support to African American students and historically black colleges, UNCF addresses educational disparities and fosters long-term economic empowerment through education, which can lead to generational changes.
> 
> Among these options, the **International Rescue Committee** and **Habitat for Humanity** stand out as organizations that not only provide immediate assistance but also actively work towards creating self-sufficiency and resilience in communities, thus having a greater potential for long-term change.
