**user**:
> Suppose I have a regression equation,
> 𝑇_𝑖=𝛼+𝛽Emit_𝑖+𝛾ECS_𝑖.
> Now, I want to decompose the variance of T. What does the law of total variance say about the additive parts of Var(T)?
**assistant**:
> The law of total variance (also known as Eve's law) is a fundamental rule in statistics that provides a formula for decomposing the variance of a random variable. It states that the variance of a random variable can be decomposed into the expected value of the conditional variance and the variance of the conditional expectation.
> 
> Let's say you have a regression equation as follows:
> 
> 𝑇_𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽*Emit_𝑖 + 𝛾*ECS_𝑖
> 
> The total variance of T can be decomposed into parts related to the variability of Emit, the variability of ECS and the covariability between Emit and ECS, plus the unexplained variance.
> 
> A simple expression for this decomposition can be, given that the expected value E[T] = μ and E=Emit and S=ECS:
> 
> Var(T) = E[E[(T - μ)^2|E,S]] + Var[E(T|E,S)]
> 
> The first term, E[E[(T - μ)^2|E,S]] , is the expected value of the conditional variances, sometimes referred to as the 'within-group' variance or the expected conditional variance. It describes how much T varies around its conditional mean for each combination of Emit and ECS.
> 
> The second term, Var[E(T|E,S)], is the variance of the conditional expectations, or the 'between-group' variance. It accounts for how much these conditional means vary around the overall mean of T.
> 
> Please note that this is a simplification, and if the regression residuals aren't identically distributed, there could be additional terms or corrections.
