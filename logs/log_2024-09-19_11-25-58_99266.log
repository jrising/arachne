> What are some examples of temperature units? I can only think of Kelvin and Fahrenheit, but I want something less well-known.
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are a few less commonly known temperature units:
> 
> 1. **Rankine (°R or °Ra):** Used mostly in engineering fields, especially in the United States, Rankine is to Fahrenheit what Kelvin is to Celsius—a thermodynamic temperature scale based on absolute zero. The Rankine scale uses the same size degree as Fahrenheit.
> 
> 2. **Delisle (°D):** Proposed by the French astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle in 1732, where the boiling point of water is at 0 °D and the freezing point is at 150 °D.
> 
> 3. **Réaumur (°Ré):** Invented by René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur in 1730, it sets the freezing point of water at 0 °Ré and the boiling point at 80 °Ré. It was widely used in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, in the 18th and 19th centuries.
> 
> 4. **Rømer (°Rø):** Devised by the Danish astronomer Ole Christensen Rømer in 1701, this scale sets the freezing point of brine as 0 °Rø and the boiling point of water as approximately 60 °Rø.
> 
> 5. **Newton (°N):** Proposed by Isaac Newton, this scale was based on the freezing point of water at 0 °N and the boiling point of water at 33 °N.
> 
> These varied scales highlight the historical diversity in approaches to measuring temperature before standardization favored Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.
**user**:
> How about for mass? What are some non-normal ones? Like, as an example unit for time, I'm mentioning "work days".
**assistant**:
> Great question! Here are some non-standard units for mass that are less commonly used but interesting:
> 
> 1. **Slugs:** Primarily used in the United States customary system, a slug is the mass that will accelerate at 1 ft/s² when a force of 1 pound-force is applied. It’s mainly used in physics and engineering.
> 
> 2. **Poundal:** This is a unit of force, but when thinking of mass in the context of force, it's useful to note that 1 poundal is defined as the force required to accelerate a mass of one pound at a rate of one foot per second squared.
> 
> 3. **Carat:** Commonly used in measuring gemstones and pearls, one carat is equivalent to 200 milligrams (0.2 grams). It offers an alternative perspective on mass in specific industries.
> 
> 4. **Quarter:** A traditional unit of mass in agriculture, especially relating to grain. In the UK, a quarter is equal to 8 stones (about 112 pounds or 50.8 kg), though it may vary in other contexts.
> 
> 5. **Kille:** Used in some regions, especially in Ireland, a kille is a historical unit traditionally used to measure grains and was associated with a weight of about 120 pounds (54.4 kg).
> 
> 6. **Stone:** Commonly used in the UK, one stone equals 14 pounds (6.35 kg), often used in measuring body weight.
> 
> 7. **Cattie or Catty (猫斤):** Used in various East Asian cultures, particularly in China and Southeast Asia, the catty has slightly different values by region, but it generally equals approximately 600 grams (1.32 pounds).
> 
> These units can offer a unique perspective on mass in certain contexts, just like "work days" does for time!
