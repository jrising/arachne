This is a method of measuring the total amount of work or 'yield' of an occupation over an individual's working life based on industry averages. It might consider factors like the average number of years in a particular profession, the typical workload in a given time period (like a day, week, or year), and any outputs that can be easily quantified (like presentations for a consultant).

I would recommend trying an online search with as much information as you remember. That might help jog your memory or allow the search engine to find the presentation you're thinking of.
