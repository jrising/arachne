> In an uncoupled state, the environment exists in its natural form without human activities affecting its balance. If we consider a natural eco-region (a non-urbanized area), the energy balance is mainly determined by the sun's radiation, the albedo (reflectivity) of the earth's surface, and the energy absorbed or lost through conduction, convection, and long-wave radiation. There might be forests, grasslands, bodies of water, and other natural features that play a role in atmospheric temperature, humidity, and the movement of air.

> In an uncoupled human system, humans live without significantly modifying the natural environment for their needs. These can include, for instance, nomadic tribes, small-scale agriculturalists, etc., who live in sync with nature without significantly altering it. They minimally influence the environmental heat balance, primarily through heat released from their bodies and minor human activity, like cooking fires.

> An "urban heat island" is a fine example of how these two systems couple. As cities develop, natural surfaces like vegetation and water bodies are replaced by asphalt, concrete, buildings, and other urban materials. These materials have lower albedo (they absorb more sunlight) and release the absorbed heat into the environment, creating a localized increase in temperature compared to the surrounding rural areas.

> In the coupled system, both the human and natural systems shape each other's characteristics and dynamics. A countless number of human elements - such as energy use, waste heat from industrial processes and transportation, urban architecture and planning - contribute to shaping the urban temperature profile. The biophysical environment responds to these alterations, such as through convective heat transfer processes, urban breeze circulation, and the altered local hydrological cycle, to name a few effects.
