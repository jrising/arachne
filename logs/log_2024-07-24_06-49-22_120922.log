> In the VELUX Group, 98% of our carbon footprint relates to scope 3 emissions and comes from outside our own operations; the majority is from the materials used in our products. To achieve our emission reduction goals, we must work closely with our partners and suppliers.

> Understanding our emissions is the first step to reducing them
> To improve how we measure and report emissions, we are asking suppliers to report emission data to us. Reporting through CDP is one acceptable way to disclose data. This is a global disclosure system that enables organisations to manage their environmental impacts. Supplier-specific data provides a more accurate overview of our scope 3 emissions and helps us determine if our decarbonisation initiatives have the required effect. 
> 
> 
> At the close of 2023, 126 suppliers reported their environmental data through the CDP model. For our suppliers of direct materials, this represents at least 72% of our scope 3 emissions from the purchase of direct materials. We also engaged with our top suppliers and encouraged them to set their own carbon reduction targets in line with science. At the close of 2023, 33 of our suppliers, representing around 3% of scope 3 emissions, have set targets under the Science Based Target initiative. We will continue our efforts to expand the share of emissions covered by science-based targets and have included this as an expectation towards all suppliers in our Supplier Decarbonisation Policy."

> what would the price for a 3 year memerbship with consutling hours be for an itnernational org like velux? 
**assistant**:
> Determining the exact cost of a three-year membership package with consultancy hours for an international organization like VELUX would depend on various factors such as the scope of consultancy services required, the level of engagement desired, and the specific needs of VELUX within the context of IMT's offerings.
> 
> To provide an accurate pricing estimate, I would recommend engaging directly with the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) to discuss VELUX's specific requirements, the depth of consultancy support needed, and any additional customizations that may be desired as part of the membership package.
> 
> IMT would be best positioned to provide a tailored pricing proposal that aligns with VELUX's sustainability goals, the expected benefits from the partnership, and the level of engagement VELUX seeks within the IMT community.
> 
> I suggest reaching out to IMT's membership services or partnership team to initiate these discussions and receive a personalized pricing proposal that reflects the unique needs and aspirations of VELUX as they embark on this collaborative journey towards sustainability.
