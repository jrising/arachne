> Can you edit the following concept note, focusing on clarity and conciseness?
> 
> This concept note describes our envisioned approach to the Belmont Forumâ€™s Climate, Environment, and Health II call (https://www.belmontforum.org/cras#ceh22023). It is open to further development through conversations with partners.
> 
> The research would look at the (1) impacts on climate change on food production, and (2) consequences of the resulting malnutrition on vulnerable populations.
> 
> On (1), climate change is expected to impact crucial agricultural production, both in the US breadbaskets and for staple crops across the developing world. At the same time, increased CO$$_2$$ is expected to partially offset these losses, but with a reduced density of nutrients. It is also expected to cause undermine fisheries in many regions, through population shifts, changes in habitat, and increased mortality at different life-stages.
> 
> We particularly want to highlight the dependence of the food production system on ecosystem services. Agriculture relies on ecosystem processes that ensure soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification. Fisheries depend on healthy environments, and the habitats and food webs that these produce.
> 
> Existing evidence connects agricultural and fisheries productivity to climatic features (growing degree-days, rainfall, sea surface temperatures), but the outcomes of climate change on different regions is heavily dependent upon the changing features of their environments and the ecosystem services that they produce. A static and uniform perspective is inadequate.
> 
> We aim to contribute to the evidence base connecting climate to food systems by deepening the understanding of ecosystem service channels and impacts.
> 
> For (2), the weakening of the ecosystem services that food systems depend upon is a direct threat to health. Food scarcity, through crop failure and weakened fisheries, can lead to malnutrition; foods deficient in essential nutrients like protein, zinc, and iron can lead to nutrient deficiency; and increased harmful algal blooms can result in shellfish poisoning.
> 
> Given the complexity of the food system, not all populations are equally vulnerable to these changes. We plan to study consequences for low-income countries, partnering with researchers who have relationships with stakeholders and access to detailed data. We are looking to co-develop tools or data that help vulnerable groups be resilient to these health risks.
> 
> We are particularly interested in the effects on migrants and displaced people. Since these groups are disconnected from their support networks and will not receive the highest quality food, they provide a good case study for effects that may become more pervasive later in the century. Involuntary displacement is also expected to increase under climate change, due to climate disasters and degraded ecosystems. We will study both the effects on vulnerable groups and the climate-driven increase in those groups.
> 
> We see this topic as addressing all three call themes (Decision-science through stakeholder engagement and policy-directedness; Food security; and Climate Risks to Ecosystems & Populations).

> This concept note outlines our proposed approach to the Belmont Forum's Climate, Environment, and Health II call, subject to further refinement in discussion with partners. Our research focuses on the implications of climate change on food production and subsequent consequences for vulnerable populations.
> 
> The first area of investigation concerns how climate change affects agricultural production, particularly staple crops, in the US and developing nations. Despite the partial offset by increased CO$_2$, which however diminishes nutrient density, the changes will likely disrupt agriculture and fisheries through population shifts, altered habitats, and increased mortality rates.
> 
> We stress the significance of ecosystem services in supporting food production systems. Agriculture depends on ecosystem processes like soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification, while fisheries need thriving habitats and balanced food webs.
> 
> While existing studies link agricultural and fisheries productivity to climate variables, the impacts of climate change are heavily dictated by the changing environmental features and ecosystem services unique to each region. A standardized, one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate. We aim to deepen the understanding of ecosystem service channels and their impacts on food systems.
> 
> The second area of study revolves around the direct health threats arising from the degradation of ecosystem services. This degradation can lead to food scarcity and nutrient-deficient foods, resulting in malnutrition and nutrient deficiency diseases. Additionally, increased harmful algal blooms pose a risk of shellfish poisoning.
> 
> Considering the intricacies of the food system, certain populations are more vulnerable than others. We intend to examine the consequences for low-income countries, in collaboration with researchers having existing stakeholder relationships and access to extensive data. Our goal is to co-create tools or data facilitating the resilience of these vulnerable groups to health risks.
> 
> We are especially interested in studying the impact on migrants and displaced individuals. These groups, often detached from support networks and consuming substandard food, represent a valuable case study for wider future impacts. Anticipated to rise due to climate disasters and ecosystem degradation, involuntary displacement also merits attention. Hence, we'll investigate the effects on, and climate-driven increase of, these vulnerable groups.
> 
> This project aligns with the three call themes: Decision-science through stakeholder engagement and policy-directedness; Food security; and Climate Risks to Ecosystems & Populations.
