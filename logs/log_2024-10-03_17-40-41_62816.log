> I am intrigued by your research on the economic impact of climate change and waterbody impact that are my research interest as well given my undergraduate thesis on "Lysozyme Produced from Duck Egg is Capable of Reducing Methane Emission from Ruminants" and published paper on "Nanomaterials as a sustainable choice for treating wastewater".

> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your research interests as well as your professional background in environmental management. Your undergraduate thesis and published paper show an interesting exploration of economical and sustainable solutions to environmental issues.

> It sounds like you would be a good candidate for the Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program at the University of Delaware. Please note however, that funding is always a constraint in our ability to admit students. Although there are some funding opportunities, the ESM program is generally unfunded for most students, and I recommend applying as early as possible in order to be taken into consideration for any available financial aid.
> 
> Your interest in my area of research is encouraging—if you decide to move forward and apply, mentioning my work and your related interests in your application’s statement of purpose could increase your chances of aligning with a project and funding.

In light of your above response, should I just apply in the usual process of the masters program mentioning your work as my interest and  I will be connected with you in a future project and plausible funding or should I discuss further with you over a zoom meeting/in any other way you prefer for further connection in my application documents?
