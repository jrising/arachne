> I am writing a story of one of my ancestors, and the story takes place in Norwich, UK during the Elizabethan era (specifically, 1563 - 1574). In a later story (two generations later), an ancestor meets a comic-relief character, a rat named Sergeant Buzfuz. I want to introduce a related character-- an ancestor of Buzfuz-- and I think it can be a rat that comes over with the Great Stranger Migration of Dutch and Flemish protestants. Ideally, this rat would have a name that is (1) interpretable in Dutch/Flemish, and (2) provides insight into the origin of Buzfuz's silly name, perhaps by sounding like it. Any ideas?

> What a fascinating project! For a character that is an ancestor of Sergeant Buzfuz and ties into the Dutch and Flemish heritage, you might consider a name that hints at the comic nature while maintaining a Flemish or Dutch feel.
> 
> Here are some suggestions:
> 
> 1. **Sergeant Boffels**: "Boffels" is a playful-sounding name that can evoke a silly but endearing character. In Dutch, "boffen" means to have good luck, which could tie into the Buzfuz’s lineage of whimsical charm.
> 
> 2. **Sergeant Bofzoet**: Combining "Bof" (luck) and "Zoet" (sweet), this name gives a delightful yet slightly absurd feel that aligns with "Buzfuz".
> 
> 3. **Sergeant Buizewind**: “Buize” refers to a pipe or tube, and “wind” to wind. While it literally doesn't mean anything specific, it evokes a light, airy, and whimsical character, which can be seen as a precursor to the silliness of "Buzfuz".
> 
> 4. **Sergeant Boffensnel**: "Boffen" (luck) and "snel" (quick) combined create a name that suggests a lucky, speedy, and perhaps slightly outrageous character.
> 
> Out of these, **Sergeant Boffels** seems to fit well. It has a certain cheerful and comic ring to it that could logically evolve into "Buzfuz" over generations. Plus, it maintains the Dutch roots of the character's origin, connecting nicely with the historical context of the Great Stranger Migration.
