> What is included under economic risks of climate change?
**assistant**:
> 
> 
> The economic risks of climate change refer to the potential negative impacts on various sectors of the economy, caused by the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. Some examples of economic risks of climate change include:
> 
> 1. Physical risks: These refer to the direct and indirect economic impacts of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and changes in precipitation patterns. Physical risks can affect sectors such as agriculture, real estate, and infrastructure.
> 
> 2. Transition risks: These refer to the economic risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. This could include policy changes, technological innovations, and changes in consumer behavior, which could lead to stranded assets, changes in commodity prices, and market disruptions.
> 
> 3. Liability risks: These refer to the potential legal and financial liabilities that companies and governments could face due to climate-related damages, such as lawsuits from affected communities or insurance claims.
> 
> 4. Financial risks: These refer to the risks to financial systems and markets posed by climate change, such as increased credit risk, decreased asset values, and reduced access to capital.
> 
> Overall, the economic risks of climate change are complex and interconnected, and can affect different sectors of the economy in different ways.

> How do economists define economic welfare?
**assistant**:
> Economists define economic welfare as the level of well-being or satisfaction that individuals, households, or societies derive from the consumption of goods and services. Economic welfare is generally measured in terms of utility, which is a subjective measure of the satisfaction or happiness that people derive from consuming goods and services.
> 
> There are two main approaches to measuring economic welfare in economics: 
> 
> 1. The first approach is based on income or wealth. It assumes that higher levels of income or wealth generally lead to higher levels of economic welfare, since people can use their income or wealth to purchase more goods and services and increase their standard of living.
> 
> 2. The second approach is based on the concept of utility. This approach assumes that the ultimate goal of economic activity is to maximize people's well-being or satisfaction, rather than simply increasing their income or wealth. It therefore focuses on the benefits that people derive from the consumption of goods and services, rather than their monetary value.
> 
> Economists use various methods to measure economic welfare, such as surveys, experiments, and statistical analysis. These methods attempt to capture people's preferences and subjective experiences of well-being, and to quantify them in a way that can be compared across different individuals or groups.

> What is the difference between risk and uncertainty?
**assistant**:
> Risk and uncertainty are both concepts used in economics and finance to describe situations where there is a lack of complete information or knowledge about the future, but there is a subtle difference between the two.
> 
> Risk refers to situations where the probabilities of different outcomes are known or can be estimated with some degree of confidence. In other words, there is some degree of predictability about the future outcomes, and the probabilities of different outcomes can be assigned a numerical value based on statistical analysis or other methods. Examples of risk include flipping a coin, rolling a dice, or buying stocks in a well-established company.
> 
> On the other hand, uncertainty refers to situations where the probabilities of different outcomes are unknown, and cannot be estimated with any degree of confidence. In other words, there is no clear or objective way to assign probabilities to different outcomes, and the future is fundamentally unpredictable. Examples of uncertainty include the outcome of a political election, the success of a new startup, or the impact of a new technology on the market.
> 
> In summary, risk is a situation where the probabilities of different outcomes are known or can be estimated, while uncertainty is a situation where the probabilities of different outcomes are unknown and cannot be estimated with any degree of confidence.

> Are CGE models macroeconomic models?
**assistant**:
> Yes, CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) models are macroeconomic models. These models are used to analyze the interactions between different sectors and agents in an economy, including households, firms, and governments, and to simulate the effects of different policy changes or shocks on the overall economy.
> 
> CGE models are based on general equilibrium theory, which assumes that markets are perfectly competitive and that prices adjust to equate supply and demand across all markets. The models typically include a large number of equations that describe the behavior of different agents and the interactions between different markets, such as labor, capital, goods, and services.
> 
> The models are generally used to analyze the effects of various policy changes, such as changes in tax rates, subsidies, or trade policies, on different sectors of the economy and on overall welfare. They can also be used to analyze the distributional effects of different policies on different groups of households or firms.
> 
> In summary, CGE models are macroeconomic models that are used to simulate the effects of policy changes or shocks on the overall economy, based on general equilibrium theory and a detailed description of the interactions between different agents and markets in the economy.
