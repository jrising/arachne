> How can I ensure that the listings package in LaTeX treats single and double quotes in R code as normal characters, so that one can copy them from the resulting PDF straight into R? They are currently typeset as curved quotes.

> To ensure that the `listings` package in LaTeX treats single and double quotes in R code as straight quotes, you can configure the `listings` package to recognize them as "other" characters. Here's how you can adjust your LaTeX document to achieve this:
> 
> ```latex
> \usepackage{listings}
> 
> % Define your settings for R code
> \lstset{
>   language=R,
>   % Add more settings as needed
>   % To use straight quotes
>   literate={`}
>            {\textasciigrave}1 % Use single quote
>            {‘}{"}1
>            {’}{"}1
>            {“}{"}1
>            {”}{"}1,
> }
> 
> \begin{document}
> 
> \begin{lstlisting}
> # Your R code
> x <- "This is a string with 'single' and \"double\" quotes"
> y <- `correct_width`
> \end{lstlisting}
> 
> \end{document}
> ```

> But the example above should work well to make the quotes copy-paste correctly into R by maintaining the straight quotes in your listings. Let me know if you need any more adjustments!
**user**:
> That made no difference. My code is "\lstinline{df = read.csv('treefracs.csv')}" and it still shows up with the single quotes as curved.
**assistant**:
> To address the issue with curved quotes when using `\lstinline` in LaTeX and ensure that single and double quotes are treated as straight quotes, you can redefine the quote characters specifically for inline listings. Here's how you can set it up:
> 
> ### Step-by-Step Solution
> 
> 1. **Disable Smart Quotes Globally**: First, ensure that your document is not using smart quotes globally. You can accomplish this by using the `fontenc` package with options to disable curly quotes.
> 
> 2. **Define `\lstinline` Character Settings**: Specify how you want single and double quotes to be treated in `lstinline`.
> 
> Here's an example of how you can configure your LaTeX document:
> 
> ```latex
> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}  % Use T1 font encoding
> \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
> \usepackage{listings}
> \usepackage{lmodern}       % For better font handling
> 
> % Settings for listings
> \lstset{
>   basicstyle=\ttfamily,
>   literate={'}{{\textquotesingle}}1
>            {`}{{\textquotesingle}}1
>            {"}{{\textquotedbl}}1
>            {"}{{\textquotedbl}}1
> }
> 
> \begin{document}
> 
> Here is some R code:
> 
> \lstinline{df = read.csv('treefracs.csv')}
> 
> \end{document}
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation of Key Components:
> 
> - **Font Encoding**: The `T1` font encoding setup ensures that the correct characters are processed.
> - **Literate Option for Quotes**: The `literate` setting replaces any curly quotes with straight quotes when processing the `\lstinline`.
> 
> ### Compile Your Document
> 
> Make sure to compile your LaTeX document using a LaTeX editor or toolchain that supports these packages and settings (like Overleaf, TeXShop, or certain command-line tools) to see if the changes resolve your issue. If you continue to see issues, please let me know!
