> Proposal for Engagement: Bank of America Corporation and Institute for Market Transformation
> Alignment of Sustainability Visions and Collaboration Opportunities
> The Institute of Market Transformation (IMT) and Bank of America Corporation (BofA) share a common vision for a future where success is synonymous with sustainability and community well-being. Bank of America’s proactive approach to mobilizing capital for societal good aligns with IMT’s mission to drive market transformation towards energy efficiency and sustainability in the built environment. Together, we can accelerate the journey towards a secure and sustainable lower-carbon future. 
> 
> Through a collaborative approach to mobilizing capital to vulnerable and front line communities, we propose a unique model where BofA will have access to multiple IMT programs. This will include invitations to collaborate on materials and opportunities to present valuable solutions to ultimately  improve the lives of people living and working in buildings and the communities that surround them.
> Overarching Benefits of Partnership with IMT 
> The Institute for Market Transformation aspires to make buildings more secure, sustainable and energy efficient through customizable best-practice and educational resources to support stakeholder building performance policy compliance, with a focus on high-performance building sector workforce development initiatives. Through partnering with IMT, BofA will have access to industry specific knowledge, exclusive data on green leasing and building performance and a national network of government, business, and community organizations. We believe  buildings are the key to  reduce pollution, protect health, create wealth and economic opportunity, and enable resilient communities and BofA would be highlighted as a leading financial institution making possible a just transition.  
> 
> Our proposed partnership offers BofA expertise, tools and resources to help reduce risk, including climate transition risk of policy non compliance as well as ESG reporting and disclosures. Additionally, through exclusive networking events and collaborative projects, Bank of America can position itself as a sustainability leader and pioneer in green building practices in 2025 and beyond. 
> 
> Programs for Bank of America's Participation 
> Green Lease Leaders: Sponsorship of a Leading Global Program to Remove Split-Incentives
> Green Lease Leaders (GLL) has set the industry standard for green leasing best practices for over a decade. These leases break down the split-incentive barrier and align financial and environmental goals between landlords and tenants, allowing all parties to achieve win-win sustainability outcomes. GLL has grown beyond the US and includes organizations based in the UK, Canada, Mexico, and more. The program provides publicly available technical resources, webinars, thought leadership, and collaborates with other organizations to educate the industry on green leases as a tool to remove the split-incentive and accelerate the private sector transition to a low-carbon economy. Bank of America and GLL have already demonstrated shared values. For example, IMT provided feedback on the UK’s Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI)’s paper “Narrowing the split incentive gap to decarbonize the built environment”. BofA CEO, Brian Moynihan, is Chair of SMI. 
> 
> With its global presence, occupancy of mostly rented and leased spaces, and active role in cross-sector and public-private coalitions, BofA is uniquely positioned to showcase its commitment to sustainability and drive transformative change in the real estate sector through the Green Lease Leaders program. As a GLL Champion, BofA will have direct access to the GLL team, who will provide green leasing consulting services to ensure that all standard lease forms are aligned with BofA’s ESG goals, reporting requirements, and meet industry best practices.
> 
> This work with the GLL team will better equip BofA to use their leases to achieve SBTi goals, meet net zero targets, and reduce risk. For example, it can be challenging to collect critical property-level data, which is necessary for accurate ESG reporting and disclosures if the lease does not have language that requires landlords to share this data. There is also an opportunity to utilize leases to minimize the potential risk of noncompliance fees for spaces located in jurisdictions with building performance standards. 
> 
> Further, by sponsoring the GLL program, BofA will have the opportunity to co-author resources with the GLL team and provide case studies that can help educate other tenants about the utility of green leases and set an example for peers in financial services. As Bank of America supports the Green Lease Leaders program, it helps GLL continue this important global work. BofA not only advances sustainability but also showcases its dedication to removing the split-incentive barrier. This collaboration is a compelling narrative of corporate responsibility and collective action towards a brighter, more sustainable future for all.
> Building Performance Partnership
> IMT is a founding partner of the Building Performance Partnership (BPP), which seeds and supports Building Innovation Hubs (Hubs) across the country. We are a growing national network of Hubs with each one tailored to meet local context and needs to drive decarbonization for all. Hubs provide support for local training, education, policy support, case studies, building efficiency tools, and financing solutions. Supporting the BPP can help connect BoA to a suite of localized resources and support for your own real estate portfolio decarbonization needs, but also provide national exposure to a wide audience of stakeholders looking for financing solutions for their own decarbonization projects. 
> The BPP currently has sponsorship opportunities for our national webinar series. This series will highlight those who are pioneering market solutions for decarbonizing challenging sectors, such as affordable housing, co-ops and condos, and market-rate residential properties. The series will include topics such as Scaling Affordable Housing Decarbonization and Reinventing Housing in the Heartland. There are three webinars remaining in the series and with a $20,000 sponsorship, BoA will receive the following benefits for all three webinars:
> Primary logo visibility on all webinar marketing materials, email blasts, social media and presentation materials
> 5-minute speaking slot to promote BoA and how you are supporting decarbonization efforts for your organization and beyond
> Access to a list of attendees and their organizations
> The Building Innovation Hub
> Located in Washington DC, the Building Innovation Hub (the Hub) is deeply rooted in the local community, helping building industry professionals create and operate high-performing buildings. Our goal for the Hub is to meet the current needs of the building industry while simultaneously pushing it towards the innovative solutions needed to achieve environmental and financial sustainability. To do this, we provide resources and connections to help building owners, operators, designers, contractors, community groups, workers, brokers, and tenants (and more!) improve their buildings and their lives. 
> The Hub has a corporate membership program where we collaborate with industry leaders to connect ambition with tangible action for buildings, communities, and governments. Membership has benefits such as:
> Access and exposure to a diverse network of stakeholders in the commercial real estate industry nationwide and a connections to leadership in the DC metro region;
> Opening remarks at Hub events, inclusion in Hub branding and newsletter; and an organization spotlight feature;
> Collaboration opportunities with the Hub on webinars, in-person events, resource development, and more;
> Prominent placement during the inaugural DC Climate Week and speaking opportunity at our event (date and partners TBC).
> Corporate Engagement Opportunities (CEO) Program
> As an owner and lessee of approximately 75 million square feet of real estate in the U.S., Bank of America is subject to the growing landscape of building performance policy. These policies range from basic benchmarking and disclosure to required audits, tune-ups, and commissioning, to meeting specific building performance targets. It can be a lot for any company with a large portfolio to manage to mitigate any risks of non-compliance. As an NGO who works with U.S.government agencies on building policies, we have an internal expertise and unique perspective on these policies, which is why we developed the Corporate Engagement Opportunities (CEO) program. This program simplifies energy policy tracking by directly delivering building performance policy data, industry-leading insights, and training. This fee-for-service program is leveraged by companies of all kinds, including Johnson Controls, and Moody’s Analytics, to track and plan against regulatory noncompliance fees, an emerging risk related to building performance policy requirements. This program has options that include our Supporter tier, which provides proactive information and education on the latest policy updates, and our API accessible database, which tracks 140+ and growing unique building performance standards, benchmarking policies, and audit/tune-up/retro commissioning requirements in standardized data fields, making it simple to stay on top of the latest updates to energy policies. Membership benefits for BofA include: 
> Reducing climate transition risk and expensive fines for BoA’s real estate portfolio through better policy tracking.
> Includes data on public policies in active development
> In addition to tracking, IMT authors building policy summaries for all currently enacted Building Performance Standards (BPS) in the United States. 12 jurisdictions have enacted BPS policies across the US, and IMT can provide 1-2 page summaries detailing key points like compliance requirements, building size thresholds, crucial reporting dates, and performance targets by property type. These Policy Summaries can be used to educate the BoA teams in those corresponding markets to make sure both owned and leased spaces are prepared to meet building requirements. 
> Detailed Funding Allocations for Consideration 
> Bank of America partnership with IMT will include a  dedicated relationship manager to ensure access to thought leadership, exclusive speaking and networking opportunities, and expert insights in the sustainability and green building sectors. We are also able to further customize engagement opportunities to align with Bank of America’s sustainability goals and demonstrate leadership in the commercial real estate industry. We look forward to establishing a partnership.

> ## Shortened Proposal: Bank of America Engagement with Institute for Market Transformation (IMT)
> 
> The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) suggests a unique partnership with Bank of America (BofA) to leverage both entities' shared vision for sustainability and societal well-being. This partnership harmonizes BofA's proactive approach with IMT's commitment to strengthen the transition towards a lower-carbon future by improving energy efficiency in the built environment.
>
