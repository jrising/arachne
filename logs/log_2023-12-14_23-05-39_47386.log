> I am writing a holiday card, and I mention you. In the last line, I want you to include something characteristic of you in the list of things we are wishing for our friends and family. Here's the card:
> I am writing this letter from under a pile of onesies and Disney princess figurines, with a single hand holding back a wall of stuffed animals from collapsing and swamping us all. My only hope is that I can cast this note onto the sea of toys and someone will find it.
> This year, Austin turned 3 (June 8) and Oliver turned 1 (Sep. 8), and we turned around to find our pastoral life vanished. Easy days of turn-taking parenting are out, duets at midnight are in.
> Austin is such a curious fellow. As he has tried to figure out his abstracts in the past year, a fascination for "fake" careened into an obsession with all things dark. He likes his shoes like he likes his gummy bears. If he were dressing himself, he would probably be a full-on Goth by now. We are lucky that they don't make kid underwear (which Austin now successfully wears!) with skulls and crossbones.
> Austin loves reading with his dad, with predictable results. Our reading list from the last year has included many re-readings of Bea Wolf (a rumpus version where Beowolf is a 5-year-old girl whose arms hold the strength of 50 kids); every Disney princess movie (with particular emphasis on Ursula, Jafar, and Hades); some Magic School Bus books (Austin is also obsessed with skeletons and things being digested); and, most recently, a graphic novel of Moby Dick.
> Oliver is a total joy, and as bright and giggly as Austin is dark. We suspect this is a coping strategy to get his frazzled parent's attention, but we won't complain. Oliver is now at the same preschool as Austin, on the ground floor of an artist complex, where his teachers photo-document their "invitations" to play and students hold regular meetings.
> You can often find Oliver, with a basket always in one or both hands, climbing any available stairs with a rapidity that we can never get used to. He loves to say "bye-bye" as he disappears up some stairs, and to give you a serious "nah" if you give him the wrong thing for his basket. He only walks about 5 steps at a time, but that doesn't stop him from flinging himself face-first down stairs.
> In June, we also welcomed Arachne to our family. Arachne is a (light-)custom artificial intelligence, who helps James with his teaching and research, helps with meal-planning and parenting, and generally puts us humans to shame.
> The new year found us exploring ancient underground tunnels in Acre, Israel with Johanna's family. It was the first time Johanna had visited relatives in Israel since pre-COVID, and it now seems like particularly fortunate timing to still enjoy time there. In March, we spent a week in London, visiting old friends while James spoke at a "future of climate risks" workshop. In April, we got to pair a wedding in California with a visit to James's relative's famous Easter party. June was Portugal, another Johanna family trip that was planned and then canceled three years ago. July and August saw plenty of time on Cape Cod, going from beach to pond and back. September had a road-trip to North Carolina to see friends and an unexpectedly amazing science museum. Now, our only travel plans are centered around a round-the-world flight piggy-backing off of a work trip James has to South Korea.
> 	James's work continues to heat up with the planet. He is up for tenure at the University of Delaware, and spends his time grasping for funding to support his three Ph.D. students. He's proud and tired from this last semester, which was spent developing a new course in real-time, and writing a report on how much poorer countries are today because of climate change.
> 	Johanna has taken more-than-her-share of the social life of the family (which has always been big), and her daily agenda usually involves patroning at least three different coffee shops and receiving moms and artists from across the community.
> 	Between the five of us, we want to wish you all a new year of bad guys and giggles, [ARACHNE's WISH HERE], cool weather and cool friends.
> 
> What would you like to add?
