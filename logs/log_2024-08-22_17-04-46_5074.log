**assistant**:
> Certainly! Let's start by updating the docstring. It appears the original docstring had some inaccuracies in terms of naming. Here's an example:

> 
> Next, let's create a unit test for `get_demand_cost`. We need a mock implementation of the `is_peak` function and some test data.

> ```julia

> 
> # Mock implementation for `is_peak` function.
> function is_peak(dt::DateTime)
>     # Simple example: assume peak hours are 7 AM to 7 PM.

> end
> 
> # Unit test
> @testset "get_demand_cost" begin
>     dt0 = DateTime(2024, 8, 1, 0, 0) # Starting at midnight
>     kwbytimestep = [1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 6.0] # Power usage in kW
>     timestep = 1.0 / 4 # 15 minutes
> 
>     result = get_demand_cost(dt0, kwbytimestep, timestep)
>     expected_result = 18.73 * max(round(6.0), round(6.0 / 3)) # The expected demand cost based on the mock data
> 
>     @test result â‰ˆ expected_result
> end

> 
> This unit test provides a basic evaluation of `get_demand_cost` to ensure it behaves correctly for a given set of inputs. The `is_peak` mock function defines peak hours for the sake of testing, which can be adjusted based on how "peak" is defined in your actual implementation.
