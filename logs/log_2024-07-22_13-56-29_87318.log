**assistant**:
> In the context of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE), **MRV services** refer to the processes and systems used for **Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification**. These services are crucial for assessing the effectiveness and environmental impact of OAE activities aimed at increasing the ocean's capacity to absorb and store atmospheric CO₂. 
> 
> Here's a brief breakdown of each component:
> 
> 1. **Monitoring**: This involves the continuous measurement and collection of data on various parameters such as seawater chemistry (e.g., alkalinity, pH, carbonate concentrations), biological impacts, and CO₂ sequestration rates.
> 
> 2. **Reporting**: This covers the systematic documentation and communication of the monitored data—information that stakeholders, including regulators, policymakers, and the scientific community, need.
> 
> 3. **Verification**: These are the processes used to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and transparency of the reported data through independent reviews and audits.
> 
> MRV services collectively ensure that OAE is implemented responsibly, allowing for the assessment of both the efficacy of CO₂ removal and the identification of any potential negative environmental impacts.
