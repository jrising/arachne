> Certainly! Here is the paraphrased text:
> 
> Jacqueline A. Dowling discusses how long-duration energy storage can address short-term storage requirements. The worth of various storage technologies lies in their capacity to supply electricity economically during periods lacking solar and wind energy, thereby lessening the need to excessively increase solar and wind generation capacity to meet electricity demand reliably.
> 
> The study examined how differences in wind and solar resources across regions affect the value of using single or multiple types of storage technologies.
