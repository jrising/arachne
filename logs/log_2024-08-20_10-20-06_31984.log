> What's an easy way for people to see in a table header that the numbers are in 1000's of USD?
**assistant**:
> A clear and concise way to indicate that the numbers in a table are in thousands of USD is to include this information directly in the table header. You can modify the column header to reflect the scale. For instance:
> 
> - Instead of "Revenue," label the column as "Revenue (in 1000s USD)."
> 
> This approach immediately informs viewers of the scale and units used, reducing potential confusion. If you have multiple columns using the same unit, you can include a note at the bottom or top of the table: 
> 
> - "All financial figures are in thousands of USD."
> 
> Both methods keep your table well-organized and make it easier for readers to understand the data presented.
**user**:
> What would be a short way to show this?
**assistant**:
> You can use a simple notation in the header to make it compact. For example:
> 
> | Revenue (K USD) | Expenses (K USD) |
> |------------------|------------------|
> 
> Or, you can create a note below the table for clarity:
> 
> **Note:** All figures are in thousands of USD.
> 
> This keeps the table tidy while communicating the necessary information clearly.
**user**:
> Would it work to say "$'000s"?
**assistant**:
> Yes, using "$'000s" is a concise and clear way to indicate that the values are in thousands of USD. Hereâ€™s how it would look in the header:
> 
> | Revenue ($'000s) | Expenses ($'000s) |
> |-------------------|------------------|
> 
> This notation effectively communicates the scale while keeping the header brief and easy to read.
