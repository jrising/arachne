> GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - "type-1" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)

> 2-bit quantization is a technique used for compressing the size of these weights, which can reduce the storage needed and also the computational cost at the expense of some loss in precision. Essentially, instead of using a full floating point number to store each weight, 2-bit quantization limits the weight values to only four possible levels.

> This is done by first scaling and shifting the weights so that they span from -1 to +1 (or from 0 to 1 for unsigned weight values). Then, straightforward rounding can quantize the weights to the closest of the four possible 2-bit representations (-1, -1/3, +1/3, or +1 for signed quantization, or 0, 1/3, 2/3, or 1 for unsigned).

> If you are running your model on hardware with limited memory or computational power, or need to minimize the energy usage, then you might benefit from a lower bit quantization. On the other hand, if you are not constrained by these factors, and the model's accuracy is paramount, then using more bits could be beneficial. It's best to run experiments for your specific use case to see how changing the quantization affects your model.
