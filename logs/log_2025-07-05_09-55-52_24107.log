> I am writing a case study on Bangladesh and its use of long-term planning to address climate risks. It appears that this is also part of their strategy to get aid and concessionary finance. I can set up an interview with someone in the Ministry of Finance.

> Here are the divisions of the MoF in Bangladesh:
> The Ministry of Finance (Bengali: অর্থ মন্ত্রণালয়) is a Bangladesh government ministry that oversees the country's fiscal policies and financial institutions.[2] It is currently led by adviser Salehuddin Ahmed.[3] The poor performance of the financial sector is commonly attributed to the ministry's leadership, including ministers and secretaries across its multiple divisions.
> 
> Critics have raised concerns about executive overreach by secretaries in the banking and revenue sectors, alleging their involvement in financial mismanagement.[4][5] These issues reportedly include large-scale bank loan fraud, money laundering schemes, and the politicization of financial institutions. Such systemic problems have allegedly contributed to substantial capital flight, with reports estimating that up to $240 billion has been illicitly transferred abroad over the past 15 years.[6]

> Who would be best to talk about the planning processes (I'm thinking like the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100) and how fiscal considerations enter in?
**assistant**:
> For an insightful discussion on Bangladesh's long-term planning strategies such as the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, and how these plans link with fiscal considerations, I recommend reaching out to someone in the following divisions within the Ministry of Finance:
> 
> 1. **Economic Relations Division (ERD):** This division is pivotal for handling international financial relations, including aid and concessionary finance. They would be well-equipped to discuss how Bangladesh leverages long-term planning to secure international funding and support.
> 
> 2. **Finance Division:** They are responsible for national budgeting and fiscal policies, making them a key player in integrating financial resources into long-term climate planning like the Delta Plan.
> 
> An official or senior adviser from these divisions familiar with the financial aspects of climate strategies and international financial negotiations would be ideal. They can provide detailed insights into the planning processes, fiscal implications, funding strategies, and how these elements interact to execute a comprehensive approach to addressing climate risks.
**user**:
> I thought of both of those, but I couldn't figure out which unit in the Financial Division would be most relevant.
**assistant**:
> In the **Finance Division**, the following units may be especially relevant for discussing long-term planning in the context of fiscal considerations:
> 
> 1. **Economic Policy Unit:** This unit focuses on economic analysis, forecasts, and policy development. They would likely have insights into how long-term plans like the Delta Plan intersect with overall economic policy and fiscal strategies.
> 
> 2. **Public Financial Management (PFM) Unit:** This unit handles budgeting and financial management practices. They can provide details on how financial resources are allocated to climate initiatives and general governance related to fiscal discipline and sustainability.
> 
> 3. **Investment Corporation of Bangladesh:** Although primarily focused on investment, this corporation can shed light on the interaction between public investments and climate-related projects, linking the financial aspect directly to long-term planning.
> 
> ### Recommendation:
> Reaching out to the **Economic Policy Unit** or the **PFM Unit** within the Finance Division would likely yield the most relevant insights regarding fiscal considerations in long-term planning related to climate risks.
