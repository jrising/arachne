> The Building Innovation Hub serves the Washington DC metropolitan area in several key ways:
> 
> 1. **Sharing Knowledge and Resources:** The Hub is designed to deliver resources, technical expertise, and training for building industry professionals. It provides information on the latest building practices, sustainability benchmarks, regulatory changes, and more. This education and training enhances the skills of professionals in the field and helps them to stay up-to-date with the rapidly changing landscape of the building industry.
> 
> 2. **Promoting Energy Efficiency:** The Hub is focused on promoting energy efficiency and sustainability in the built environment. It helps businesses and institutions to understand and navigate complex energy and building codes, and assists in the adoption of high-performance building practices. By doing so, it contributes to lowering DC's carbon footprint and making structural changes towards a more sustainable future.
> 
> 3. **Hosting Events and Training Programs:** The Hub hosts various events, webinars, and training programs to disseminate the latest updates, trends and innovations in the building industry. These initiatives facilitate networking between building professionals, providing a platform for collaborations and partnerships that can drive the implementation of sustainable practices in the building sector.
> 
> 4. **Providing Support for Introducing Innovative Practices:** The Hub provides support to building owners, operators and consultants, and contractors in implementing energy-efficient practices, aiming to reduce building-related pollution. As a part of this, they might help design sustainable building plans, select appropriate materials, or navigate complex certification processes.
> 
> 5. **Incentivizing Sustainable Building Practices:** By conducting building performance assessments, the Hub can help demonstrate the financial benefits associated with sustainable buildings - such as energy savings, reduced operating costs, or increased property values - and therefore incentivize more widespread adoption of these practices.
> 
> 6. **Advocating for Policy Changes:** Additionally, the Hub engages in policy discourse, advocating for required changes and updates in building regulations and standards to stimulate greater innovation in the industry. It works to make sustainable building practices not just an aspiration, but also a norm. 
> 
> 7. **Supporting Local Economy:** The Hub's training programs and educational events also indirectly support the local economy, by providing opportunities for local vendors, generating job opportunities, and increasing business activities in the region.
> 
> Therefore, the Building Innovation Hub plays a crucial role in transforming the building industry in the DC metropolitan area, while also contributing to global sustainability goals.
