> I see that there are multiple log-based intrusion-prevention security tool (Fail2ban, DenyHosts). How should I choose one for my Apache webserver, which I will also use to provide Shiny visualizations?

> When choosing an intrusion-prevention security tool, you need to consider the specific requirements of your system and what each tool has to offer. Fail2ban and DenyHosts, for example, both offer automatic IP blocking in response to repeated failed login attempts. They both use log files for monitoring. But they differ in several ways:
> 
> 1. **Platform coverage**: DenyHosts is compatible only with Unix-like systems, whereas Fail2ban supports a more extensive range of platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and MacOS.
> 
> 2. **Extensibility**: Fail2ban has more extensive extensibility. In addition to SSH and Apache, Fail2ban can work with a larger set of services such as vsftpd, lighttpd, and others. Fail2ban can even interpret any log format, giving it an edge when dealing with diverse or unique log files.
> 
> 3. **Performance**: DenyHosts is lighter on system resources, as it is written in Python and designed to have a small footprint. Fail2ban, while still lightweight, is more resource-intensive due to its greater versatility.
> 
> 4. **Synchronization and networking**: Only DenyHosts has a feature that synchronizes blocked IPs across multiple machines, offering a form of cooperative protection.
> 
> As you're using an Apache webserver and want to provide Shiny visualizations, I'd recommend considering Fail2ban. Its extensibility allows you to cover more ground with various services. In addition, the ability to interpret any log format can be crucial given the diverse types of logs created by web servers and Shiny applications.
> 
> However, you should study your server performance and balance that with the benefits of each tool. While DenyHosts is more lightweight, Fail2ban offers broader coverage and versatility. If your server has the resources to handle Fail2ban, it would typically be the better choice. If server resources are a concern and you primarily need the security tool for SSH protection, then DenyHosts might be a more suitable choice. Keep in mind the lack of MacOS support if that applies to your system environment.
> 
> In any case, remember that these tools are just one line of defense and should be combined with other security methods such as strong, unique passwords; two-factor authentication; security group policies; firewall settings; user training; and regular system updates and patches.
