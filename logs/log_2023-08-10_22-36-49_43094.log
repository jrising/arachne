> A colleague is asking for data on Highly migratory species and MRIP recreational angler surveys from a NOAA (NMFS?) official. That official wants to know what the parameters of the request should be-- space, time, and fields to collect. For space, we are just interested in Delaware waters. For time, back to 2008 would be preferable, as would sub-annual data. First, are those reasonable parameters for this kind of data? Second, what kinds of fields would each of these datasets include?
**assistant**:
> Yes, your parameters related to the spatial extent (Delaware waters) and temporal extent (from 2008, with sub-annual resolution) are reasonable for this kind of data.

> 1. **Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Data:** The HMS dataset usually controls for large pelagic species such as tunas, sharks, swordfish, and billfish. These species are known for long-range migrations across oceans. The data fields might include the following:
>     - Species name
>     - Catch location (coordinates)
>     - Date of catch
>     - Catch method (longline, purse seine, etc.)
>     - Weight of individual catch
>     - Length of individual catch
>     - Tagging data if available (tag number, release location, recapture location, days free)
> 
> 2. **Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) Recreational Angler Surveys:** These data are collected through angler interviews and mail surveys. Therefore, these data will have a different structure compared to HMS dataset. Common fields include:
>     - Angler's ID (this can be anonymized to protect privacy)
>     - Date of fishing trip
>     - Duration of fishing trip
>     - Target species
>     - Number of each species caught
>     - Number of each species released
>     - Fishing mode (shore, private/rental boat, for-hire boat)
>     - Fishing area (might be divided into sub-state or even county areas)
> 
> Please remember to check if these data fields meet your specific requirements. Also, keep in mind that the level of detail and the granularity of the data might vary depending on specific survey programs and reporting practices. 
> 
> If increased granularity or specific fields are required that aren't traditionally included in these datasets, it's wise to initiate a discussion with the NOAA official to see if that data could be made accessible.
