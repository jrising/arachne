> Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility
> At Chemours, inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDE&A) are foundational to who we are as a business. We strive for IDE&A at all levels, from our Board of Directors and Executive Management to the community-based programming we undertake in all locations, including the communities neighboring our Chemours Discovery Hub in Newark, DE (primary project location). Chemours continually strives to create a more representative and inclusive workforce, as demonstrated in our policies and practices. We have worked tirelessly to exceed the ethnic diversity and gender parity goals outlined in our Corporate Responsibility Commitments:
> • A U.S. workforce with at least 30% ethnic diversity by 2030
> • 50% of all executive positions filled with women by 2030
> • 35% of all positions globally filled by women by 2030, with full gender parity as quickly as
> possible
> Chemours has trained all supervisory and management personnel globally in identifying and removing unconscious bias. We have instituted a holistic safety framework, which includes safeguarding the physical, psychological, and emotional safety of every Chemours employee. Chemours has a standing IDE&A Council as part of its governance framework and uses the power of our seven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to create a deeper understanding of, appreciation for, and allyship with different cultures, identities and orientations, and perspectives.
> Chemours has been a leader in promoting STEM education within underrepresented communities. As part of the Chemours Vibrant Communities Program, between 2018 and 2022, the company has distributed 36% ($18 million) of the $50 million the company committed to invest in philanthropic work, including STEM education. From being the originator of the Future of Chemistry Scholarships (FOCS) to being the founding company partner in the industry-wide Future of STEM Scholars Initiative (FOSSI), Chemours has been at the forefront of championing IDE&A in science education. Both FOCS and FOSSI provide scholarships to traditionally underrepresented students who choose to pursue STEM related fields at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). We have numerous Memoranda of Understanding with Colleges and Universities nationwide to advance science education and research, including HBCUs. Our project partners are also committed to DEIA. Cummins maintains strong relationships with HBCUs and other universities, as well as partnerships to support diverse and equitable recruiting efforts. The research teams will utilize these sources to engage interns and utilize apprenticeship programs where relevant positions exist.

> Project-related DEIA goals include:
> • IDE&A in Program Hiring: Chemours currently has a memorandum of understanding
> (MOU) with the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The MOU is inspired and supported by the US Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Office and is a statement of alignment with the Hydrogen Program’s provisions for Equity, Environmental and Energy Justice (EEEJ) Priorities, most notably to “increase the clean energy job pipeline and job training for individuals.” Chemours intends to coordinate efforts with students from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to establish a workforce pipeline via internships that promote research career paths that lead to secure jobs in the energy sector and in Science, Technology Engineering, and Math (STEM). For this project, Chemours will leverage this MOU to interview MSI candidates for postdoctoral scholars and/or graduate students to fill roles created by the project.
> • IDE&A in Education: For this project, Chemours will work with the University of Delaware (UD) chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). Together, we will establish a hydrogen seminar series program to raise awareness and build interest in hydrogen studies and careers.
> • IDE&A in Procurement: Chemours commits to pursuing increased diverse procurement opportunities. For this project, we commit to proactively seek certified diverse suppliers, including minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses.
> • IDE&A in Research: Expand our existing partnerships with UD, Delaware State University, North Carolina A&T University, and West Virginia State University to create undergraduate, graduate, doctoral and post-doctoral opportunities connected to our hydrogen-related research, and share knowledge of hydrogen technologies, ensuring their applications benefit diverse socio-economic, ethnic, and disadvantaged communities in line with Justice40 initiatives, and create equitable career pathways within a hydrogen economy. (See: Workforce). When sharing research, Chemours will explore making research products and engagement materials accessible in a greater variety of formats to increase accessibility of research outputs.
> Energy Equity
> Securing a clean energy future utilizing sources such as hydrogen creates a stronger workforce, a more robust and resilient economy, and a better and brighter future for our public health. Hydrogen fuel cell technology has garnered attention as a potential zero-emission fuel with transportation and industrial applications that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, as a result, mitigate climate change impacts. However, green hydrogen faces significant challenges in terms of security, equity, and sustainability. The primary equity challenge for green hydrogen is that it is costly and inefficient. The cost of hydrogen production and distribution impacts the affordability of such technology and access to clean energy options. This project will investigate membrane optimization with the aim of developing high performance commercial membranes that can approach the DOE hydrogen production cost target of $1/kg by 2031. This initiative aims to reduce the overall cost of hydrogen, while also allowing for longer durability.
> Environmental benefits include:
> Control Number: 2922-1649
> 2
> 
> • Energy equity through improved cost effectiveness and reduced energy burden: The success of this investigation will indirectly and directly reduce PEMWE costs, facilitating H2 at <$2/kg. The improved performance and reduced cost of hydrogen energy will likely improve energy affordability and accessibility for all communities. An increased adoption of hydrogen energy will contribute to a reduction of energy burden for members of disadvantaged communities.
> • Energy equity through reduced emissions and environmental burdens: Increased adoption of fuel cell vehicles will reduce emissions and the associated environmental and health burden thereof for disadvantaged communities located along and at the intersection of major transportation corridors.
> • Energy equity through improved water access and reduced water waste: The success of this project in improving fuel cell efficiency and durability through membrane optimization will lead to reduced water usage and/or waste during electrolysis. By facilitating the growing adoption of green hydrogen through efficient and durable fuel cell technology, this project would indirectly lead to water savings in the long term.
> Chemours will commit $100K/year to fund a research grant project by UD graduate student(s) to study the impact of the hydrogen economy on disadvantaged communities (DACs). The goal of the research project is to assess the equity and justice implications of the outcomes and impact of the R&D project and electrolyzer technology.
> Additionally, Chemours proposes a Community Engagement Initiative focused on educating the broad community about clean hydrogen energy: what is it, why it’s important, and how it will impact the community. The goal is to 1) ensure the community is well informed on the topic, 2) emphasize public health and prosperity benefits, and 3) respond to concerns around the new technology and process.
> Chemours will collaborate with UD, leveraging their Knowledge Based Partnership programs in education, arts and culture, health, and place-based partnerships in Wilmington, Newark, and Southern Delaware. In addition, Chemours will work with the graduate and undergraduate Community Engagement Summer Scholars. Chemours will work with UD to design and execute engagement programs that are mutually beneficial to the students, faculty, and communities, with a focus on DACs around Newark, DE, Wilmington, DE, and Elkton, MD. Together, we will ensure all community engagement efforts are co-created, co-implemented, co-assessed, and co- disseminated. Potential programs include:
> • Summer program for undergraduate or graduate students to work on a relevant community-based research or creative project and present findings.
> • Collaborating with high school teachers in the region to integrate clean hydrogen energy knowledge into their science curriculum.
> Once the programs are defined, Chemours and UD will identify faculty and community partners to collaborate, plan and judge the application process, and establish project deliverables. To support this initiative, Chemours will provide $30k/year for seed grants and internships/co-ops for undergrad and grad students.

**user**:
> What is HBCUs and MSIs?
**assistant**:
> HBCUs and MSIs are educational institutions that specifically focus on serving historically disadvantaged or underrepresented communities in higher education:
> 
> 1. **HBCUs**: Historically Black Colleges and Universities are institutions in the United States that were established before 1964 with the primary mission of educating African American students. They were created at a time when racial segregation prevented Black individuals from attending predominantly white institutions. HBCUs have played a crucial role in providing access to higher education and promoting educational opportunities and advancement for Black communities.
> 
> 2. **MSIs**: Minority Serving Institutions are a broader category that includes HBCUs as well as other institutions that primarily serve and support minority populations. This includes Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs). MSIs play a significant role in addressing educational disparities and promoting diversity and access in higher education for various minority groups.
> 
> In the context of the grant proposal you provided, Chemours has established partnerships with HBCUs and MSIs to promote STEM education and provide opportunities for students from these institutions to pursue careers related to the hydrogen economy.
