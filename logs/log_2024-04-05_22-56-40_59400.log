> My name is Ms Onyinyechi Chinenye Aghanwa. I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree with Second Class honors (Upper-division-2008) with a Cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.86 on a scale of 5 points in Maritime Management Technology and a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree (2017) with a Cumulative Grade Point Average of 4.16 on a scale of 5 points in Marine Transport Management both from Federal University of Technology Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. I am looking forward to starting a Phd  in  Marine Studies at the University of Delaware, United State of America  by September 2024 Fall Admission/Applications. I desire to work under your supervision.

> I am interested in studying at the University of Delaware, United State of America particularly in your research laboratory which focuses on impacts of climate change thereby bringing together empirical estimates and integrated assessment models. Your research also focuses on modeling of social-environmental systems with concentrations on complex systems, food and fisheries, and resource management.

> My research tends to focus on “Assessment of the Impact of flooding on coastal areas”. Climate change threatens increased levels of flooding in the coastal and riverine flood plains. The coastlines change shape over time through natural processes, with climate change, human activity and existing flood defense putting many homes, businesses, and coastal communities at risk of flooding and abandonment. Coastal management techniques (Hard Engineering) is one approach that will aid the management of risk of erosion and flooding. This involves the placement of artificial structures which are used to stop or slow the natural processes of erosion, flooding and sea-rise level. I intend working with this tool to enable me to find solutions to the coastal and flooding issues ravaging the coastal communities. I have also embarked on a training programme on disaster management where I gained knowledge on these modules: risk assessment and mitigation, emergency preparedness and response, recovery and reconstruction, disaster management policies and governance.

> 
>  In my pursuit of a Master's degree (M.Sc.), I did courses in Maritime Safety and Security, Management of Marine Environment, Maritime Transportation and Risk Analysis, Port Operations and Management, Marine Insurance Law and Policy, Management of Ship operations, Maritime Engineering, For my B.Tech (Honors) dissertation, I conducted research on; ‘’Survey of Inland Water Transportation in Anambra State (Nigeria)’’. This has enabled me to gain research skills that will be an advantage in the pursuit of my doctoral degree.
> 
> My long-term career plan and goals is to become a Maritime Instructor and Safety Consultant, solving problems that may demand my expertise skills in the maritime industry. After my graduate studies, I intend cooperating with government agencies in Nigeria to work on a master plan and policies that will support mitigation of climate change. I will also volunteer and get involved with conservation organizations in Nigeria to sensitize and educate residents of the coastal communities on the knowledge of climate change and the adaptation measures.

> Furthermore, I would like to inquire if fully-funded research opportunities are available in your research laboratory. I exchanged email with you prior to submitting an application for Fall 2024 admission. However, I was not successful, possibly because I submitted after funding consideration deadline.

> I look forward to a favorable response from you and will appreciate the opportunity to further discuss with you on how my skills and strength can best serve your research group.

**assistant**:
> Dear Ms Onyinyechi Chinenye Aghanwa,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your academic background and research interest align well with my field of specialty, and you certainly have a strong foundation in this area. However, it seems there is some confusion surrounding the exact program of interest.
> 
> You mentioned that you wish to start a PhD in Marine Studies. In our university, we have a _Ph.D. in Marine Policy_, and another, preferred one _Ph.D. in Environmental Economics_. Both of these could be good fits, depending on the exact nature of your objective. The former is good for non-traditional students or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds, while the latter is preferred particularly for those with a substantial quantitative foundation and/or specific interest in environmental economics.
> 
> Please note that funding is always a constraint in our ability to take Ph.D. students. Therefore, I encourage you to express in your statement of purpose how your research specifically aligns with mine, particularly if it is about climate change risks, food systems, or interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. Having taken note of your interest in my research on modeling of social-environmental systems and given your background, I suggest reconsidering the _Ph.D. in Environmental Economics_.
> 
> However, given your background in Marine Management and Interest in coastal study, the recently started _Environmental Science & Management program_, which includes a marine track might fit your needs too.
> 
> I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds.

> Please feel free to email me if you have further questions.
