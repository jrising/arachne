**assistant**:
> To execute a block of code that's stored as a string in Python and capture its printed output, you can use the `exec()` function and redirect the standard output temporarily using the `io` module. Here's a step-by-step example:
> 
> ```python
> import io
> import sys
> 
> # Your code as a string
> code_string = """
> print("Hello, world!")
> for i in range(3):
>     print("This is line", i)
> """
> 
> # Create an in-memory text stream to capture output
> output_buffer = io.StringIO()
> 
> # Backup the current stdout
> old_stdout = sys.stdout
> 
> try:
>     # Redirect stdout to the buffer
>     sys.stdout = output_buffer
>     
>     # Execute the code
>     exec(code_string)
>     
>     # Get the output from the buffer
>     output_string = output_buffer.getvalue()
> finally:
>     # Restore the original stdout
>     sys.stdout = old_stdout
> 
> print("Captured Output:")
> print(output_string)
> ```
> 
> This script defines a `code_string` with the code you want to execute. It captures the printed output by redirecting `sys.stdout` to a `StringIO` object, then executes the code using `exec()`. After execution, it restores the original `sys.stdout`.
> 
> This approach ensures that any output generated by the executed code can be captured and handled within your script.
