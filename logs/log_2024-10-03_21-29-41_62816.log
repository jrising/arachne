>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> Dear Dr. James Rising,
> 
> I graduated from the department of Aquaculture and Fisheries Management (Bachelor’s degree) at the Federal university of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria with a CGPA of 4.02/5.0.
> Under the supervision of Professor D.O Odulate, I conducted research that assessed the relationship between water quality parameters and diversity of phytoplankton in the middle basin of Ogun River, Ogun state. This has put me on the frontline to learn various methods of assessing the diversity of phytoplankton, their abundance and how water quality parameters affect them with the use of software like Paleontological Statistics software (PAST), SPSS, among others.
> Before graduation, I have gained relevant technical and professional work experience at the ERIWE Fish farm, by working with several farmers and participating in catfish breeding and hatchery management, catfish grow-out, fish processing and fish feed making.
> 
> I am writing to request your supervision in order to pursue a Doctorate degree at University of Delaware in Fall, 2025, with interest in Marine Chemistry. Having gone through your high impact research, I have concurred that our research areas perfectly align, and I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss potential research ideas with you.
> 
> I am confident that my investigative qualities, independence, creativity, critical thinking, communication skills and my technical skills would be an asset to your research group. I am enclosing my curriculum vitae and unofficial transcripts for your review.
> Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to getting a favorable response from you.

**assistant**:
> Based on the email from Amoda Oyefolake, it seems that they have a strong background in aquatic sciences, particularly related to phytoplankton and aquaculture. They are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Marine Chemistry at the University of Delaware. While Marine Chemistry is a natural science program, their mention of alignment with your research areas might indicate some overlap or interest in interdisciplinary work.
> 
> Since their interest appears to be in a natural science program, it might be appropriate to redirect them to the relevant contact person. Here's how you could respond:

> Dear Folake,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your impressive background and interests. Given your focus on Marine Chemistry, I recommend that you contact Professor Xinfeng Liang at [xfliang@udel.edu](mailto:xfliang@udel.edu) for guidance on your application. He can provide more specific insights into aligning your interests with the Marine Science programs offered here.
> 
> If you believe your research interests strongly overlap with my work in climate change risks, food systems, or interdisciplinary quantitative modeling, you may also mention this in your statement of purpose as you apply.
> 
> Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with. I wish you the best in your pursuit.
