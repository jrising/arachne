> What is the economic survey technique, where you elicit people's valuation of something by asking them to compare different options? I think it's hedonic something, but I want to make sure it's appropriate to my case. I would have lower-income consumers and be asking about their decision-making for EVs, with the main comparison being whether there are closer EV charging stations.

> The technique you're referring to sounds like "conjoint analysis." Conjoint analysis is a survey-based statistical technique used in market research to understand how people value different attributes of a product or service. By asking respondents to compare different options, you can infer the relative importance of different attributes and how they impact decision-making.

> In your case, using conjoint analysis to understand how lower-income consumers value proximity to EV charging stations compared to other factors (like cost, range, brand, etc.) could provide valuable insights. While not the same thing, you might have also been thinking of "hedonic pricing," which is a method often used to estimate economic values for ecosystem or environmental services that directly affect market prices, but it doesn't fit your context as well as conjoint analysis does.

> If you're focusing on consumer preferences and decision-making, conjoint analysis is likely the appropriate tool. It allows you to simulate how different configurations of EV features might be perceived and to predict consumer choices under various scenarios.
