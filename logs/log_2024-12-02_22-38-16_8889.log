**user**:
> I'm collaborating with someone and we now want to archive the github code for our project on Zenodo. I've done that before for my own repos, but can I do that here, where the repo is owned by her?
**assistant**:
> To archive a GitHub repository on Zenodo and create a DOI, the person who owns the repository (your collaborator, in this case) will need to set up the integration, because only the owner has the permissions to link the repository to Zenodo.
> 
> Here are the steps you can advise your collaborator to follow:
> 
> 1. **Github Account and Zenodo Login**: Make sure she has accounts on both GitHub and Zenodo.
> 
> 2. **Activate GitHub-Zenodo Integration**:
>    - She should log into Zenodo.
>    - Navigate to the GitHub section within Zenodo and authorize the connection between her GitHub account and Zenodo. This usually means authorizing Zenodo's GitHub App to access her repositories.
> 
> 3. **Select Repository**:
>    - In Zenodo's GitHub page, she will need to select the repository she wants to archive. This involves toggling the repository to "on" in the list of her available GitHub repositories.
> 
> 4. **Create a Release**:
>    - On GitHub, she can create a "release" for your project. This typically involves tagging a specific commit, giving it a version number, and providing release notes.
> 
> 5. **Zenodo Archive Creation**:
>    - Once a release is created, Zenodo will automatically archive it and create a DOI for the release. This process might take a short while.
> 
> 6. **Sharing the DOI**:
>    - After Zenodo completes the process, a DOI will be available to use for referencing your project. She can share this DOI with you and others.
> 
> This setup process only has to be done once per repository. Afterward, any new releases made in the GitHub repository will automatically be archived and linked to a DOI by Zenodo. If sheâ€™s comfortable, she might also add you as a collaborator in Zenodo for easy access and management.
> 
> If your collaborator needs any help with these steps, you could offer to walk through them together!
