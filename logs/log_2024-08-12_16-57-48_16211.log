> I want to write a very fast function in Julia that gives me the next integer above a given number. ceil usually works for this, but if the number in question is, say, 4.0, ceil will return 4.0 again when I want 5.0. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> To create a function in Julia that always returns the next integer above the given number, even when the number is already an integer, you can simply add 1 to the result of `ceil` when the number is an integer (whole number). Here's a function you can use:
> 
> ```julia
> function next_integer(x::Float64)
>     if x == floor(x)  # Check if x is an integer
>         return Int(x) + 1
>     else
>         return Int(ceil(x))
>     end
> end
> ```
> 
> This function checks if `x` is already an integer, and if so, it adds 1 to it. Otherwise, it applies `ceil` and converts it to an integer. You can call this function with any floating-point number, and it will return the next integer above it.

> If you expect `x` to be of a type other than `Float64`, you might want to broaden the type signature or handle conversions as needed. If you're interested in even more performance, you might implement some specialized behavior for other numeric types as well.
