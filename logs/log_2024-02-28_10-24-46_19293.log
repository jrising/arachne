> The following is a paragraph from a grant proposal I am writing: 
> 
> ===
> NASRDA (National Space Research and Development Agency) and IMR (Institute of Marine Research, Norway) play pivotal roles in scenario and impacts identification (WP1), with IMR’s Erik Olsen, Marek Ostrwoski, Geir Ottersen and NASRDA’s involvement mirroring their commitment to leveraging remote sensing for agricultural productivity and climate change effects on fisheries. Oluwaseun Adeluyi helps lead WP2, focusing on climate change effects on crop production, demonstrating excellence in remote sensing and its application to agriculture.
> 
> CRODT (Centre de Recherches Océanographiques de Dakar-Thiaroye), shared leadership with IMR in WP3, underscores expertise in fisheries. Coumba Ndoffene Diouf, Marian Kjellevold, Arnault Le Bris, Erik Olsen, Marek Ostrwoski, Geir Ottersen, and Abdoulaye Sarre, emphasize the consortium’s depth in assessing climate impacts on fisheries from biological and ecological perspectives.

> I have gotten a comment from one of my co-PIs:
> "This sentence is a bit convoluted. IMRs role here is 1) to support the development of scenarios (WP1) and 2) to analyze the effects of climate change on fisheries. However, the latter (climate change on fisheries) is also covered in the next paragprah"
> 
> He is referring to the first sentence above, but the real issue is that the paragraph starts by talking about NASRDA and then highlights people from IMR-- when actually NASRDA and IMR are going to be mainly working on completely different activities (NASRDA mainly on WP2, IMR on WP3).
> 
> We also end up repeating the names of the IMR people (Marian Kjellevold, Arnault Le Bris, Erik Olsen, Marek Ostrwoski, and Geir Ottersen) in the next paragraph.
> 
> Can you propose an edit of these paragraphs which splits out NASRDA from IMR, and just mentions the IMR people once?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James. I have made modifications to the original paragraphs while taking into account the feedback from your co-PI. My main aim was to ensure both clarity and conciseness. Please see the revised paragraphs:

> ====
> 
> NASRDA (National Space Research and Development Agency) plays a crucial role in Scenario and Impacts Identification (WP1). Their commitment to leveraging remote sensing for agricultural productivity and climate change effects is particularly noteworthy. Oluwaseun Adeluyi, from NASRDA, helps lead WP2. His focus lies on the impacts of climate change on crop production, showcasing his expertise in remote sensing and its application to agriculture.
> 
> On the other hand, IMR (Institute of Marine Research, Norway) is heavily involved in WP3, emphasizing its expertise in fisheries alongside CRODT (Centre de Recherches Océanographiques de Dakar-Thiaroye). The IMR researchers, namely Erik Olsen, Marek Ostrwoski, and Geir Ottersen, also offer significant input in the development of scenarios (WP1). 
> 
> Shared leadership between CRODT and IMR in WP3 underscores a mutual speciality in assessing the impacts of climate change on fisheries. Key contributors Coumba Ndoffene Diouf, Marian Kjellevold, and Arnault Le Bris from IMR along with Abdoulaye Sarre from CRODT emphasize the consortium's depth in understanding these impacts from biological and ecological perspectives. 
> 
> ====
> 
> Here, NASRDA and IMR are separated into individual paragraphs to delineate their distinct roles, and the repetition of IMR researchers' names is minimized.
