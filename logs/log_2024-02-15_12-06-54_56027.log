**assistant**:
> Your practice of punctuation placement has a basis and is actually related to a broader discussion about "American style" versus "British style" punctuation. 
> 
> The American style, also known as typographical style, mandates that punctuation always goes inside the quotation marks, regardless of whether it's part of the original quote. This style comes from the aesthetics and readability factors when typesetting and was standardized by American printers in the late 19th to early 20th century.
> 
> The British style, also known as the logical style, suggests placing the punctuation inside the quotation marks only if it's part of the original quote—like your usage. This style is named for its emphasis on logical clarity and accuracy of the enclosed quote.
> 
> In professional publishing, different style guides like The Chicago Manual of Style and Associated Press (AP) Stylebook endorse the American style. However, guides like The Oxford Style Manual and other academic and technical guides outside the United States use the British Style.
> 
> While both styles have their merits, it's important to be consistent in the one you use, or make sure you're following the style guide preferred by your editor, publisher, or organization. Your practice of placing the punctuation outside the quotation marks for specific quoted terms (logical style or British style) is truly not without basis—it's just less common in American publishing.
