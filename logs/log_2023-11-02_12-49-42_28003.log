>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

>  
> 
> I wish you a very bright day and good health. I am highly interested in pursuing my PhD in Environmental Economics at University of Delaware from the Fall 2024 semester.
> 
>  
> 
> I am writing to you as I found that my research interests (environmental economics, economics of climate change, estimation of climate change-induced L&Ds, energy economics, development economics) are very much aligned with yours.
> 
>  
> 
> As a research professional in the arena of climate change policy research, my current activities and research interests are entirely connected with climate change policies and their implications on economic development, economic and non-economic impacts of climate change on the affected communities, implications of strategies to address climate change, and developmental challenges associated with climate change in vulnerable developing countries like Bangladesh. I’m currently working on a couple of research projects on the effectiveness of market mechanism in GHG mitigation and potential impact of energy transition on the developing economies.

>   
> 
> Your research works on climate change-related topics, especially, “Challenges and innovations in the economic evaluation of the risks of climate change” drove me to join your lab as a Research Assistant, where I could best utilize my enthusiasm for research in the field of climate change economics.
> 
>   
> 
> I hold my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Economics and with CGPAs 3.65 and 3.67 respectively, each on a scale of 4.00. My overall IELTS score is 6.5 (Reading: 7.0, Writing: 6.0, Listening: 6.5, and Speaking: 6.5).

> Herewith I am attaching my curriculum vitae and academic credentials (certificates and transcripts) for your kind consideration. If you are taking new students, it would be a great honor if you consider me and support me to continue my research activities under your supervision. I am looking forward to your positive response.

**assistant**:
> Dear Sheikh Nur Ataya Rabbi,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. It certainly sounds like your academic interests and research experience align well with the research that we do. Your interest and capabilities in environmental economics, economics of climate change, and policy-focused research would certainly make you a good candidate for the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics at University of Delaware.
> 
> However, please keep in mind that funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the year so that you can be considered for any available funds.
> 
> In your application process, do remember to mention me, James Rising, specifically in your statement of purpose. This will help highlight your interest in the work we do and your potential fit within our program.
> 
> Best of luck with your application,
>

> P.S. I see you have worked in Bangladesh. It's likely that you may cross paths with colleagues and friends who also worked and studied in the Mid-Atlantic area or at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD. I would love to hear any such connections.
