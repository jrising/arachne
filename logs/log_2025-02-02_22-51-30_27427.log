> The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Said another way, using subsets of the indicators would have produced a more accurate or robust result, and as new indicators are added beyond this, the value of the analysis was reduced. Vulnerability is not, as section 2.2.3 suggestions, sector agnostic.

It will be also clearer for me, to distinguish what you would consider desirable or optimal (but perhaps cannot suggest to adopt a different approach at this point in time) and what specific corrective measures you think they could and should implement

> Future avoided damages are not calculated correctly. It should be (D^nS_CC – D^s_CC) / D^nS_CC. Suppose that damages without a solution will get 10x worse than baseline under climate change, but a solution can halve that. The current equation produces a negative avoided damages number.

> Problems with indicators:
> - Global Climate Risk Index: (1) Why are both number of deaths and deaths per 100k included? Either you want per person results or not.  (2) Half of this index is economic and all of it is social, and yet it is listed as a physical KPI.
> - The “equation/formula” column includes a mix of formula, methods (“field measurements”—which ones and how are they used?), and units (“€”—what is included in “infrastructure”, e.g.?).
> - There is almost no connection between the indicative physical changes described for physical damages and the KPIs used to indicate them.
> - GDP Growth Contribution: (1) Since Growth is already a log value, it is odd to take ratios of it, and this can produce nonsensical results. It should be a difference.
> - Does Import value index increase or decrease with climate change? It depends upon relative prices, which depend upon relative impacts, so whether equation 3.2 is used is ambiguous.
> - Only market indices are used under economic damages. Economic damages also includes the value (e.g. WTP) of non-market goods (e.g., biodiversity), which is currently missing.
> - Reduced emissions and CO2 intensity are not measures of damages.
> - The air quality index describes itself both as a ranking (which is then a measure of relative damages) and concentrations. Which is it?
> - Mortality rate is going to be falling in some regions under climate change (e.g., Sweden due to less extreme winters) and rising in other places (e.g., Spain). In some regions, it will first fall before it rises. It is not clear how equation 3.2 is used across these cases, or how comparisons can be done between regions and time periods.
> - These need to be scaled to be between 0 and 1, but most of them do not have natural upper and lower limits (e.g., mortality rate, growth rate, etc.). It is not clear how this was done in the case study, or how it is intended in the framework.
> - I do not believe that the vast majority of these KPI can be evaluated under climate change or that the effects of adaptation solutions on them can be measured.
> - Tables 3.2 – 3.6 list various KPI, but in the sole case study, most are not used and others not in this list are used. If these lists are “suggestions”, then why are they suggested?
> 
> For the case study, 5 solutions to heat waves are listed in table 4.1, but only one solution scenario is explored. Presumably solutions are not “all or nothing”.
> 
> No future year is ever identified for the future climate change scenarios.

> According to the various SSP scenarios, Greece will be 50% - 180% richer in the 2050 than it was in 2020. While there are rationales that might justify projecting lower levels of access to electricity or sanitation facilities under heat wave conditions, these are fairly tenuous against the clearer benefits of wealth. In the absence of further justifications, many of the values in tables 4.2 – 4.9 seem arbitrary and subjective.
> 
> This work is meant to be informed by WP2, and that is included in the framework, but it is not included in the case study nor discussed in the construction of KPIs. 
> 
> DSI is not an adaptation strategy. It is a step in a planning process, which may lead to some number adaptation policies (including none).
> 
> Based on the proposal, an assessment of avoided pathways would be provided for each demonstrator, but it appears to only be done for MOE. Annex B identifies KPIs for 3 demonstrators and Annex C identifies solutions for 5 demonstrators, but the assessment is only reported for MOE.
> 
> Why is it recommended that teams wishing to apply the framework start with identifying hazards? Often, stakeholders do not know which hazards matter most for outcomes they care about—for example, overemphasizing precipitation changes relative to other hazards that have clearer shifts. They can more readily be usefully engaged in discussions about outcomes of concern. 
> 
> The most important steps, #8 and #9, seems oddly undefined. It is not clear how this was done in the case study, or how any local team would go about it. This requires consultation with a experts in a number of different areas and specific types of information to feed in, but none of that is laid out.

**assistant**:
> To clarify and provide specific instructions for revising the deliverable, I'll reframe each critique with actionable feedback:
> 
> 1. **KPIs Explanation**:
>    - **Action**: Expand on the method for identifying and evaluating KPIs. Ensure that all steps and rationale are fully explained and justified.
> 
> 2. **Equation Revision**:
>    - **Action**: Correct Eq. 3.1. Replace the current denominator with `sum(a_n)` for accuracy. 
> 
> 3. **Terminology**:
>    - **Action**: Adjust terminology to ensure clarity and precision. Note that "Direct" should not imply (bio-)physical. Group economic and health under “social” for consistency.
> 
> 4. **Future Damages Calculation**:
>    - **Action**: Revise the calculation of future avoided damages to `(D^nS_CC – D^s_CC) / D^nS_CC`. Include a worked example to illustrate the calculation, ensuring it reflects realistic scenarios.
> 
> 5. **Indicator Relevance and Classification**:
>    - **Action**: Reevaluate the relevance of included indicators, like the Global Climate Risk Index. Ensure each component is appropriately classified under physical, economic, or social categories, and consider removing redundant metrics.
> 
> 6. **Equation/Formula Column Clarification**:
>    - **Action**: Provide more specific details in the “equation/formula” column. Specify field measurements and clarify what “€” represents within “infrastructure”.
> 
> 7. **Physical Changes and KPIs Connection**:
>    - **Action**: Strengthen the link between the described physical changes and KPI indicators in terms of measurement and relevance.
> 
> 8. **GDP Growth for Economic Damages**:
>    - **Action**: Modify the use of GDP Growth Contribution. Avoid using log ratios, since they might mislead, and adopt a subtraction-based calculation for clarity.
> 
> 9. **Ambiguity in Import Value Index**:
>    - **Action**: Explicitly define how the Import Value Index should behave under climate change. Clarify the use and interpretation of Eq. 3.2 to remove ambiguity.
> 
> 10. **Non-Market Economic Damages**:
>     - **Action**: Include the valuation of non-market goods (e.g., biodiversity) within economic damages. Propose indicators or methods to account for these.
> 
> 11. **Emissions and Damage Metrics**:
>     - **Action**: Clarify that reduced emissions and CO2 intensity should be discussed under sustainability, not damages.
> 
> 12. **Air Quality Index Discrepancy**:
>     - **Action**: Specify if the Air Quality Index is a ranking or based on concentration. Define how it is used and its implications on the analysis.
> 
> 13. **Varying Mortality Rates**:
>     - **Action**: Address regional differences and temporal changes in mortality rates under climate change. Provide clear instructions on how Eq. 3.2 can be applied to compare these variations.
> 
> 14. **Scaling KPIs**:
>     - **Action**: Clarify the method used for scaling KPIs between 0 and 1. Explicitly describe the approach and rationale in the case study and framework.
> 
> 15. **Evaluating KPIs Under Climate Change**:
>     - **Action**: Review and ensure the selected KPIs can effectively be evaluated under climate change conditions. Justify their selection and applicability for measuring adaptation effects.
> 
> 16. **Case Study vs. Suggested KPIs**:
>     - **Action**: Align KPIs used in the case study with those recommended in Tables 3.2 – 3.6. Explain any divergences and the rationale behind suggested KPIs.
> 
> 17. **Solution Scenarios**:
>     - **Action**: Revise the exploration of solution scenarios to reflect multiple configurations, not just an "all or nothing" approach, especially for heat wave solutions in Table 4.1.
> 
> 18. **Future Year Identification**:
>     - **Action**: Clearly identify the future year(s) used in climate change scenarios within the analysis.
> 
> 19. **Socio-Economic Projected Values**:
>     - **Action**: Provide strong justifications for socio-economic projections used in Tables 4.2 – 4.9. Ensure they align with projected wealth increases and are not arbitrary.
> 
> 20. **Reference to WP2**:
>     - **Action**: Integrate insights from WP2 into both the KPI framework and case study, justifying its absence or addressing gaps.
> 
> 21. **DSI Clarification**:
>     - **Action**: Distinguish between DSI as a planning step and adaptation strategies. Clarify its role in the process.
> 
> 22. **Assessment of Avoided Pathways**:
>     - **Action**: Conduct and report the assessment of avoided pathways for each demonstrator, as outlined in the proposal.
> 
> 23. **Framework Application Guidance**:
>     - **Action**: Explain the recommendation to start with identifying hazards. Consider whether a focus on outcomes may better engage stakeholders.
> 
> 24. **Defining Key Steps**:
>     - **Action**: Clearly define steps #8 and #9 within the process. Provide guidance on required expertise, information types, and how to implement them locally.
> 
> I hope this revised version of the comments provides the clear instructions needed for the consortium's next steps. Let me know if you'd like any additional adjustments!
