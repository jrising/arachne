> I am using a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy to identify resources and activities that should be taken into account for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. Here is a section of that report:
> ---
> Human Use
> Areas of precaution for wind turbine development carry spatial use conflicts where development may be preferable, although developers and resource managers will have significant considerations and prioritizing in the areas represented. A variety of human uses exist in the study area, from ongoing activity to submerged obstructions.
> 
> Recreational Fishing
> Recreational fisheries also potentially have space use conflicts with offshore wind. Offshore wind turbines may serve as artificial reefs or attract/aggregate fish (Wilson et al., 2010), which may be considered favorable to the recreational fishing community. Access to areas around wind turbines will likely be a key consideration to these fishing groups. Both private boaters and fishing charters have been considered in this mapping process. Confidential data reporting the number of vessels from fishing charters was obtained from NOAA-NMFS, from the years of 2006-2010. The data were summarized and displayed in 10-minute grids per confidentiality agreements, removing 1.3% of the data with less than three vessels per 10-minute grid cell. Recreational fishing from charter vessels was reported for diving and hand line (rod/reel) fishing. An additional 2.5% of the records were removed because they lacked longitude/latitude associated with the catch. This point data was converted to raster and is displayed as a sum of trips with landings per 10-minute grid cell. Recreational fishing areas indicated for private boaters were obtained by digitizing popular areas from Captain Seagull’s Fishing Maps (with permission), Cape May to Cape Hatteras. NOAA Nautical Charts and then digitizing polygon locations of popular fishing areas were digitized. These areas are generally associated with benthic features. Please refer to Map 42.
> Recreational fishing from charter vessels is displayed as the number of vessels reporting landings at a given location. The vessels reporting catch are aggregated, thus depicting popular locations for charter vessels to bring customers fishing. These are displayed in 10-minute squares as a data restriction required by NFMS. Overlaid are polygons of areas popular for private recreational vessels. These areas represent an accumulated knowledge of popular fishing areas, although they should not be considered comprehensive, as recreational fishing vessel crews may fish extensively throughout the study area. The reader is reminded that fishing charters utilize additional areas not represented due to confidentiality restrictions. Therefore, any area fished, but not represented spatially, is fished by less than three vessels. If fishing charters and private recreational fishermen are permitted to enter wind project areas, significant conflict with gear is unlikely to occur.
> However, if recreational fishing is excluded from wind project areas, conflicts may arise if turbines are installed in areas commonly fished. (However, even in such an eventuality, the entire area within the circumference of the outer bounds of the wind project would effectively operate as a marine protected area (MPA), presumably enhancing fishing opportunities on the periphery. Therefore, recreational fishing may be compatible with offshore wind turbines (Fayram & Risi, 2007), and in a survey conducted by the University of Delaware (Lilley et al., 2010), respondents indicated that offshore wind projects would be an interesting tourism highlight. Thus, recreational fishing charters may have compatible space use with wind projects.

> Sand Borrow Locations
> The USACE maintains an active sand replenishing program for beach nourishment. Beginning in the 1970s, eroding beaches prompted officials to seek millions of cubic yards of sand from offshore deposits for beach replenishment. The USACE has identified several locations for sand borrow sites which are currently in use. Furthermore, in 2007 additional sites were identified as potential future sand borrow locations. Sand borrow sites currently in use and those identified for likely future use were obtained through the Delaware Geological Survey. Vector data that indicate USACE’s potential future borrow sites were downloaded from the Delaware Geological Society’s data download website. In this process of determining sand borrow sites, several hundred core samples were taken over the past thirty years and are available as point data from the Delaware Geologic Society. Areas currently in use may be considered exclusionary to offshore wind development because an active dredging program is operational. Since a USACE permit is required regardless of whether a wind turbine is located in federal or state waters, proposals to develop wind turbines in potential sand borrow sites should consider USACE plans as well as requirements. Please refer to Map 43.
> Artificial Reefs
> The states of Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland all have active artificial reef programs. Artificial reefs can introduce habitat complexity to the seafloor, which is otherwise relatively flat and featureless in the mid-Atlantic region. By adding complexity to the seafloor, artificial reefs are installed to introduce habitat for fish and benthic organisms. Artificial reefs may be comprised of recycled materials such as subway cars, concrete, rebar, tires, sunken ships, culvert pipes or other natural and man-made materials. The reefs provide food and protection for fish such as tautog, seabass, scup, spadefish and triggerfish, with aggregating potential for bluefish, striped bass and weakfish, as they are attracted to baitfish (Delaware Division of Fish & Wildlife, 2011). In addition to being a part of fisheries management programs, artificial reefs are popular fishing locations for recreational and commercial charter fishing operations and are heavily utilized throughout the mid- Atlantic.
> Delaware’s artificial reef program is managed by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Division of Fish & Wildlife (Delaware Division of Fish & Wildlife, 2011). The Maryland Artificial Reef Initiative is a partnership of state, federal and private partners, although the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Artificial Reef Committee advises the management of the reefs in the state (Maryland Department of Natural Resources, 2011). New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Marine Fisheries manages the state’s artificial reefs, all of which are considered to be fish havens (New Jersey Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2011). A total of 56 artificial reefs are maintained by the three states, 19 of which lie within the boundaries of the study area (Map 43).
> Existing artificial reefs and sand burrow areas represent features that can be considered highly conflicting with offshore wind turbine installations. Artificial reefs are physical obstructions on the seafloor, precluding the placement of individual turbines. The reefs are maintained by the applicable state agencies as recreational fisheries resources, hosting diversity and abundance of recreational stocks. Therefore, these reefs form a significant conflict area for micro-scale siting of individual turbines. USACE sand borrow locations required significant resources to define and will presumably continue to be utilized as such in the immediate future. These additional sites have been identified for future sand extraction, indicated on this map. Although none of the areas identified are prohibited zones for wind turbines, it is expected that governmental resource managers would give utmost consideration to the current use of these areas, and thus, they may wish to be excluded from wind turbine development in the near future.
