**user**:
> I have a QGIS package file containing a global map using multiple shapefiles. Is it possible to construct a map of the area around a latitude/longitude from python, outside of QGIS?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it is possible to plot a map with the area around a specific latitude/longitude point using Python, even without QGIS. You would need the geopandas and matplotlib libraries to handle and visualize geographical data. 
> 
> Here's a simple example that should point you in the right direction:
> 
> **Step 1**: Import the necessary libraries.
> 
> ```python
> import geopandas as gpd
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> ```
> 
> **Step 2**: Load your shapefile(s) using geopandas.
> 
> ```python
> world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres')) # replace 'naturalearth_lowres' with your actual shapefile path
> ```
> 
>  **Step 3**: Specify your area of interest around a given (latitude, longitude) using a buffer. Define a function to accomplish this:
> 
>  ```python
> def get_area_of_interest(lat, lon, buffer):
>     point = gpd.GeoSeries([Point(lon, lat)])
>     return point.buffer(buffer)
> ```
> 
> In this function, "buffer" represents the radius (in the units of your shapefile's CRS) around the point of interest.
> 
> **Step 4**: Construct the area of interest.
> 
> ```python
> area_of_interest = get_area_of_interest(your_lat, your_lon, your_buffer)
> ```
> 
> **Step 5**: Subset your shapefile by the area of interest.
>  
> ```python
> subset = world[world.geometry.within(area_of_interest)]
> ```
> 
> **Step 6**: Plot the area of interest.
> 
> ```python
> ax = subset.plot(figsize=(10, 10))
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> Remember to adjust `your_lat, your_lon, your_buffer` to the appropriate latitude, longitude, and buffer size for your area of interest.
> 
> This is a quite straightforward way to achieve this, but your real use case might need a more customized approach. Also, be aware that `geopandas` isn't as fast as QGIS for large shapefiles, but should be sufficient for most use cases.

**assistant**:
> The error you encountered is likely due to the aspect ratio calculation in the matplotlib library. It occurs when the aspect ratio calculated by `ax.set_aspect()` is not a finite positive value.
> 
> To workaround this issue, you can manually set the aspect ratio to a fixed value instead of relying on the automatic calculation. Modify your code as follows:
> 
> ```python
> ax = subset.plot(figsize=(10, 10))
> ax.set_aspect('equal')  # Set aspect ratio to equal
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> By setting `ax.set_aspect('equal')`, you ensure that each side of the plot represents the same unit length, avoiding the error related to aspect ratio calculations.
> 
> Give this modified code a try, and it should resolve the `ValueError` you encountered.
**user**:
> No change. It doesn't get to the ax.set_aspect line, since the error is occuring on the subset.plot line.
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the confusion. The error you're encountering might be due to an issue with the geometry of the subset you created or with the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) of your shapefile data.
> 
> To troubleshoot further, you can try the following:
> 
> 1. Check the CRS of your shapefile using the `world.crs` attribute. Make sure it is defined correctly and compatible with the coordinate values you're using.
> 
> 2. Ensure that the `area_of_interest` geometry is valid. You can check this by printing its value and verifying its validity using the `is_valid` method on `area_of_interest` like this:
> 
> ```python
> print(area_of_interest)
> print(area_of_interest.is_valid)
> ```
> 
> If the geometry is not valid, you can try simplifying or validating it before plotting.
> 
> 3. Try plotting the entire `world` geopandas dataframe without subsetting to see if that works. For example:
> 
> ```python
> ax = world.plot(figsize=(10, 10))
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> If this plot works without any errors, it suggests that the issue might be with the subset you created.
>

**user**:
> The world.plot line works. But the area_of_interest.is_valid line returns True. Could it be related to this warning I get:

**assistant**:
> The warning suggests that there is a discrepancy in Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) between your "world" dataframe and the "point" you're using to create the area of interest.
> 
> Your "world" dataframe has a CRS of EPSG:4326, which is the standard geographic coordinate system of WGS 84 used in GPS, but it seems the "point" doesn't have a defined CRS. As the warning suggests, you'll need to ensure both geometries have the same CRS before performing the `within` operation. Here's how to fix this problem:
> 
> **Step 1**: Ensure that the point has the same CRS as the "world" dataframe before creating the buffer.
> 
> ```python
> from shapely.geometry import Point
> import geopandas as gpd
> 
> world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))  # replace with your actual shapefile path
> 
> # Define the point using the same CRS as 'world'
> point = gpd.GeoDataFrame(gpd.GeoSeries(Point(lon, lat)), crs=world.crs)
> ```
> 
> **Step 2**: Then, create the buffer for the area of interest, making sure the buffer is also in the correct CRS.
> 
> ```python
> # Buffer the point by your chosen distance (in degrees since the CRS is geographic)
> area_of_interest = point.geometry.buffer(distance_in_degrees)
> ```
> 
> **Step 3**: Now you can correctly apply the `within` spatial operation.
> 
> ```python
> subset = world.loc[world.geometry.within(area_of_interest.unary_union)]
> ```
> 
> Make sure to replace `lon`, `lat`, and `distance_in_degrees` with your desired longitude, latitude, and buffer size, respectively.
> 
> Once you've done this, you should be able to plot your `subset` without getting the `ValueError`. Now make sure you're handling a proper buffered area (in degrees, which could be very large, depending on the buffer size you chose), given both datasets are in geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326).

> point_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[point_of_interest], crs=world.crs)

> Now you should buffer the point using the GeoDataFrame and ensure the buffered area is still in the correct CRS:

> # Buffer the point by your chosen distance
> distance_in_degrees = 10  # replace with your desired buffer size
> area_of_interest = point_gdf.geometry.buffer(distance_in_degrees)
>

> ```
> 
> Note: Geographical CRS systems like EPSG:4326 measure distances in degrees, which are not equal across the globe. For better accuracy with distance measurements, you should consider using a projected CRS that can accurately measure distances in meters or feet at the point of interest.

**assistant**:
> The warning you're encountering is informing you that buffering operations in geographic CRS (like EPSG:4326) can produce unexpected results because it's using degrees for distance, which don't translate consistently into meters or kilometers across the globe.
> 
> To perform accurate buffering, which takes into account the curvature of the Earth and provides you a buffer in real-world distance units like meters, you should first project your point of interest to a suitable projected CRS. A common choice for global maps is a World Mercator or an appropriate UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) zone for the area of interest.
