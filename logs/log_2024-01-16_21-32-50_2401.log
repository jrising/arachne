**user**:
> In flask templates, is it possible to "call" another template with an argument (a variable that gets used in that template, which may not be called the same thing in the calling template)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, this is possible in Flask using the `include` statement. Here's an example:
> 
> If you have a template named `child.html` that looks like this:
> ```html
> <div>Hello, {{ name}}!</div>
> ```
> 
> You can include it in another template, say `parent.html`, as follows:
> ```html
> {% set child_name = 'John' %}
> {% include 'child.html' with context %}
> ```
> 
> In the example above, `child.html` is being included in `parent.html` and the variable `child_name` is being passed to it. The `with context` indicates that the current context (containing `child_name`) should be used for rendering `child.html`.
> 
> However, the template variable will retain its name, which means `child_name` in `parent.html` will be accessed as `child_name` in `child.html`. Flask does not provide a native way to rename the variable while including the template. If you require different variable names in the included template, consider restructuring your templates or renaming original variables in the Python script before passing them to the template.
> 
> Also note that `include` will not include any Blocks in the child template. If you want to allow child templates to extend parent templates, then the child needs to define blocks, and the parent template needs to define a super block. This requires use of the `{% extends 'parent.html' %}` mechanism, which does not work well with passing variables.
> 
> Here's an example:
> 
> `child.html`:
> ```html
> {% block content %}
> Hello, {{ child_name }}!
> {% endblock %}
> ```
> `parent.html`:
> ```html
> {% set child_name = 'John' %}
> {% block content %}{% endblock %}
> ```
> 
> In this case, you can use `render_template` to render child.html with the variable:
> ```python
> @app.route('/')
> def index():
>     child_name = 'John'
>     return render_template('child.html', child_name=child_name)
> ```
> But `child_name` in `parent.html` will not be passed to `child.html`. Instead, it should be passed from the endpoint function in Flask.
