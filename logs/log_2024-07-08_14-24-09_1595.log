> I am experimenting with creating a new stock prediction system. For this, I need a range of interrelated stocks, ideally over multiple sectors. However, I do not want to put much money into the system for it to buy and sell. Can you suggest a collection of stocks to track, which cover a range of interrelated sectors, but with fairly low stock prices?
