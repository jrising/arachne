**assistant**:
> Your original sentence was clear and impactful, but the suggestions from your coauthors introduce some nuances that could be valuable depending on what you want to emphasize. Here's a slightly revised version that incorporates the clarity of your original sentence and acknowledges the perspectives from your coauthors:
> 
> "The record-breaking global air and sea temperatures of 2023 are likely to have intensified the string of climate impacts observed across the globe, including catastrophic wildfires, floods, droughts, and marine heatwaves."
