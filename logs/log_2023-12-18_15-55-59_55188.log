**user**:
> Is there a phrase like "Bon Voyage!" in Korea?
**assistant**:
> Yes, in Korean, you can say "잘 가요!" which is pronounced "Jal Gayo!" and translates directly to "Go well!" This is often used in a similar manner to "Bon Voyage!" in French.
**user**:
> That also has the sense of "good bye". I'm finishing a paragraph in a christmas letter about travel for the year, mentioning that we're planning to go to South Korea next year. Here's the context: "The new year found us exploring ancient tunnels in Acre, Israel with Johanna's family. It was the first time we had visited relatives in Israel since pre-COVID, and it now seems like particularly fortunate timing. In March, we spent a week in London, visiting old friends while James spoke at a "future of climate risks" workshop. In April, we got to pair a wedding in California with a visit to James's relative's famous Easter party. June was Portugal, another Johanna family trip that was planned and then canceled three years ago. July and August saw plenty of time on Cape Cod with cousin Arthur (no longer "baby Arthur" at 2), Daniel, Hannah and team-favorite Uncle Noah who designs workouts with our kids as weights. September had a road-trip to North Carolina to see friends and an unexpectedly awesome science museum. Our future speculative travel plans are centered around a round-the-world trip piggy-backing off of some work James has in South Korea." Any suggestions on a pithy way to end that paragraph?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a suggestion to pithily end your paragraph in the Christmas letter:
> 
> "And as the new year approaches, filled with the warmth of cherished memories, we eagerly await our next adventure: South Korea beckons, with its rich heritage, captivating culture, and the promise of new horizons. So, 행운을 빕니다! (Haeng-un-eul bibnida!)—Wishing you good fortune as we embark on our future voyage!"
> 
> The phrase "행운을 빕니다!" translates to "Wishing you good fortune!" and adds a nice touch to your mention of your upcoming trip to South Korea.
