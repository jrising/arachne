> I have a plotlyOutput on a shiny page, but I don't want any of the mouse-over interactivity. When you mouse over the plot, you get zoom controls, and when you hover over parts of the plot you get their labels. How can I just show the plot as it is?
**assistant**:
> To disable all interactivity in a Plotly plot within a Shiny app, you can customize the plot settings to remove elements like hover interactions and mode bar controls. Here's how you can achieve that:
> 
> 1. **Disable the Hoverinfo**: You can set the `hoverinfo` attribute to `none` for each of your traces. This stops hover labels from appearing.
> 
> 2. **Hide the Mode Bar**: You can use `config()` to hide the mode bar, which includes the zoom and save icons.
> 
> Here's a sample of how you might implement this in your Shiny app:
> 
> ```r
> library(shiny)
> library(plotly)
> 
> ui <- fluidPage(
>   plotlyOutput("myPlot")
> )
> 
> server <- function(input, output) {
>   output$myPlot <- renderPlotly({
>     # Example plotly plot
>     p <- plot_ly(
>       data = mtcars,
>       x = ~mpg,
>       y = ~wt,
>       type = 'scatter',
>       mode = 'markers',
>       hoverinfo = 'none' # Disable hover info
>     )
>     
>     # Hide the mode bar
>     config(p, displayModeBar = FALSE)
>   })
> }
> 
> shinyApp(ui, server)
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> - Setting `hoverinfo = 'none'` removes hover labels.
> - The `config(p, displayModeBar = FALSE)` function call hides the mode bar, removing the zoom and other controls.
> 
> You can adjust the `plot_ly` call and data to fit your specific plot requirements. This approach will display the plot statically, without any interactive features.
