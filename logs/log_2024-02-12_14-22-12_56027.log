> 1.1 Processes** The three most important anthropogenic greenhouse
> gases, ambient CO2 , CH4 and N2O, have risen since the Industrial
> Revolution. Figure 1.1 shows observations1 of the atmospheric
> concentration of the three main anthro- pogenic2 greenhouse
> gases—carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide (N2
> O)—over two periods: From the start of the Industrial Revolution (say,
> 1850 CE) to today, and from the start of the agricultural revolution
> (say, 8000 BC) to today. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution,
> ambient greenhouse gases have been on the rise. The increase in the
> last 150 years is quite unusual given the experience of the last
> 12,000 years. The global mean surface air temperature and global mean
> sea level have gone up too, and snow pack down. Figure 1.2 shows
> observations of the global mean surface air temperature, the
> temperature of the upper ocean and the air over the ocean, the
> temperature of the troposphere, the ocean heat content, the global
> mean sea level, the extent of arctic sea ice, the average snow cover
> in the northern hemisphere, the mass balance of glaciers, and
> humidity. Temperature, humidity, and sea level have gone up over the
> last 150 years, and snow and ice have declined. This is exactly as one
> would expect if greenhouse gas concentrations are rising (although
> climate could also have changed for other reasons), for reasons
> explained now. Greenhouse gases are transparent to visible light from
> the sun, but opaque to infrared radiation from Earth. Figure 1.3
> illustrates why more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would lead to
> global warming. The sun sends energy into space in every
> direction. Some of that energy is in the part of the spectrum that is
> visible to the human eye, and some of that energy reaches Planet
> Earth. The planet is in energy balance: It receives as much energy as
> it emits, at least on average. If not, the planet would forever heat
> or cool and would have evaporated or frozen over a long time
> ago. Earth therefore must emit energy. Earth does not emit visible
> light—it is dark at night, the ground does not light up—but it does
> emit infrared radiation. Greenhouse gas molecules are, by definition,
> transparent to visible light3 but intransparent to infrared
> radiation. That is, solar energy passes unhindered through the
> atmosphere, but infrared radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gas
> molecules. These molecules get excited, but later return to their base
> state, emitting energy as infrared radiation in any direction. That is
> the crucial part of the greenhouse effect. Infrared radiation from
> Planet Earth is directed towards outer space. Infrared radiation from
> greenhouse gas molecules can go anywhere, including back to the
> planet’s surface. With greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it is
> easier for energy to enter the planet than to leave it.

Figure 1.3: The greenhouse effect —a prediction first confirmed by Charles Keeling in 1970—and that this would enhance the greenhouse effect, create an energy imbalance, and warm the planet—first confirmed in 1993 by Richard Tol and Aart de Vos. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 show that this is indeed, at least qualitatively, the case: Higher carbon dioxide concentrations imply warming. Although the first principles are simple and well-understood, there are complications, some of which are illustrated in Figure 1.4. It shows radiative forcing, the change in energy per square metre, since 1750, due to the enhanced greenhouse effect and other factors. Carbon dioxide is by far the most important substance in the change in the Earth’s energy balance. It is also relatively well-known, the main uncertainty being the atmospheric concentration in pre-industrial times. Put together, the other anthropogenic greenhouse gases have contributed about two-thirds as much as carbon dioxide to the total radiative forcing. Relative uncertainty is about as large. But the human interference with the climate system does not end there. Ozone is a green- house gas too. It is not emitted by human activities, but results from interactions in the atmosphere with substances that are emitted by humans. Near the surface, ozone concen- trations are higher than they used to be because of precursor emissions from transport and agriculture. Higher up in the atmosphere, ozone concentrations are lower because of emissions of chlorofluorocarbons.

> moisture. The latter is more important for agriculture. There is
> little agreement on the pattern of changes in rainfall. On large parts of the globe, models do not even agree on the sign of change. However, (sub)tropical areas are likely to get drier and higher latitude areas wetter—this implies that, in the southern hemisphere, more rain will fall over sea (which is no use). In temperate areas, winters will get wetter and summers drier. Changes in rainfall tend to get larger as we look further into the future, although sign reversals are not uncommon. As it gets warmer, rainfall will tend to get more intense, with heavier downpours in between longer dry spells.  Source: IPCC WG1 AR6 SPM. Figure 1.9: The spatial and seasonal pattern of projected changes in precipitation and soil moisture Tropical storms will probably not extend their range or increase their fre- quency. Storms everywhere will intensify. Storms, both in the tropics and elsewhere, are likely to become more intense too. Maximum wind speeds will probably increase. There is no reason to assume that the frequency of storms will change much; or that tropical storms will extend their area.

>  energy. Besides technical change, behavioural change can also reduce
>  emissions. Engineers reckon
>  CO2 is less dense. The main issues with storage are permanence and safety. There is little point in storing carbon dioxide if it leaks out again. Sudden releases of carbon dioxide would endanger animal and human life. Slowing deforestation would reduce emissions but if that were easy it would have been done long ago. Besides the emissions from fossil fuel combustion, land use change also releases carbon dioxide. Reducing such emissions requires slowing down the pace of deforestation, or even reversing it. There are other reasons for doing so. Tropical forests are rich in biodiversity. Forests upstream protect against floods downstream. Mangrove forests shield coasts from waves and wind, and provide food and shelter for animals. Agroforestry promotes soil conservation and crop diversification. Yet, despite many attempts to slow deforestation, it has continued apace. This suggests that it is difficult and expensive. Unless a more lucrative alternative is offered to those that decide to chop down trees and burn forests, they will continue. Note that climate policy may even accelerate deforestation. Bioenergy needs land. Palm oil plantations in Southeast Asia replace virgin forest. Sugarcane farms in South America push other crops onto pasture land, and pasture into the rainforest. As discussed above, methane emissions are intrinsic to the production of dairy, rice, and certain types of meat. Although technical measures can be used to reduce emissions by a little bit, more substantial emission reduction requires volume measures—less dairy, less rice, different or less meat. Reducing nitrous oxide emissions requires more judicial use of fertilizers and other crop management practices, lest food production fall. Methane from waste disposal and mining can be captured and either flared or burned as a fuel. Almost all emissions can be captured with sufficiently high investment. Similarly, leaks in gas pipes can be fixed to any standard one is willing to pay for. Industrial gases can be replaced with other substances, which at present are either more expensive or perform worse. Geoengineering is a risky option. There are concerns about who would decide to geoengineer the global climate. Finally, there is geoengineering. The aim of geoengineering is not to prevent climate change, but rather to change the climate back. There are many ways to achieve this, from spraying water over the oceans to putting aerosols in the atmosphere and mirrors in space. Geoengineering sounds attractive at first sight, as it is cheap and does not require a large number of countries to cooperate. However, uncertainty is one of the main features of climate science. If we do not really know the consequences of putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, do we think we know how much sulphur aerosols we should put where to offset the impact of carbon dioxide? Even if successful, geoengineering is risky. With climate change solved, how do you convince policy makers to continue to invest in geoengineering for decades, maybe centuries on end? There are political risks in the short run, too. A mirror in the L1 Lagrangian point would deflect sunlight and cool Earth. It would be a feat of engineering that is within reach for NASA, ESA and JAXA. Who would operate that mirror? Joe Biden, Xi Jinping, or Ursula von der Leyen? Would we trust them to use this power wisely? Putting aerosols into the atmosphere is much simpler. A fleet of four large transport planes could put enough material in the air to substantially cool the planet. A small country like the Maldives could do this, or a mid-sized corporation—indeed, a start-up began doing this in late 2022. Aerosols can also be shot into the atmosphere using cannon, putting geoengineering within reach of terrorist organizations. Governance is a key concern. 
> Further reading Every six years, Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change publishes a major assessment of options for emission reduction. The information is layered, with a Summary for Policy Makers with high-level information, Technical Summaries with more detail, and multiple chapters with a lot of detail and references to the underlying literature. These reports can be found at http://www.ipcc.ch/. In 2000, the IPCC released a Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, which can be found at the same site. More recent IPCC scenarios are referred to as Representative Concentration Scenarios and Shared Socio-Economic Pathways; see van Vuuren et al., Climatic Change (2011) and Riahi et al., Global Environmental Change (2017). The best discussion of carbon-free energy sources is Sustainable Energy—without the hot air by David MacKay (2015). Oliver Morton’s The Planet Remade—How geoengineering could change the world (2016) is a excellent overview of all aspects of geoengineering. If you want to read about energy in general, no one beats Vaclav Smil, particularly his Beginner’s Guide (2017), Energy Transitions (2016), and Energy and Civilization (2017). Bill Gates’ How to Avoid a Climate Disaster is strong too. IDEAS/RePEc has a bibliography: http://biblio.repec.org/entry/tda.html.
