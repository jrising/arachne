> What's a simple Linux batch script that runs the same program 10 times, sequentially?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this in Linux using a Bash script. Here's a basic example:
> 
> ```bash
> #!/bin/bash
> 
> for i in {1..10}
> do
>    echo "This is iteration number $i"
>    your_program_command_here
> done
> ```
> 
> In this script, replace `your_program_command_here` with the command you want to run. This script uses a `for` loop to run the command 10 times sequentially. 
> 
> It also includes an `echo` statement to print the iteration number, but that's optional and can be removed if you want. 
> 
> Remember to make the script executable by using the `chmod` command:
> 
> ```bash
> chmod +x your_script_name.sh
> ```
> 
> After that, you can run this script from the terminal with `./your_script_name.sh`.
