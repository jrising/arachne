> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters and information about spatial planning for activities. Prior to this report, perhaps the most comprehensive collection of materials to inform marine spatial planning is a report, “Delaware Marine Spatial Planning: Offshore Wind Context” by Bates et al., 2012.
> 
> We have used this report as a partial template. Since this information is now a decade old, we have also worked to collect updated forms of the data.
> 
> I would like to include a section in the report on our attempts to build upon the work of Bates et al., and I want you to develop a draft of this material. Below are two status reports on the material to inform this section.

> List of datasets to ask Alison about
>  AIS Data Analysis ( Confidentially agreement with BOEM & NOAA)
>  Traffic Separation Schemes ( TSS shape-file form AIS ? )

> ## Updating Bates et al. for Modern Delaware Marine Spatial Planning
> 
> In our endeavour to upgrade and supplement the work Bates et al. performed in 2012, our team has embarked on a comprehensive data collection process to capture updated marine spatial data, across a variety of key dimensions. The 2012 study was very informative in paving the way for our present efforts, laying a solid foundation for us to improve on. The two main strategies we employed were contacting the original dataset authors (including Alison Bates) for updates and, wherever we faced challenges in this approach, we collected new data by ourselves or located updated versions of these datasets from public sources.
> 
> ### Datasets Requested from Original Authors
> We sought advice from Alison Bates and others regarding their datasets and any updates made over the last decade. We sought to obtain data from several existing sources, including popular databases like NOAA and USGS. Among the initial list of datasets we wished to obtain from the authors were AIS Data Analysis, Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS), Anchorage Area, Commercial Fishing, Recreational Fishing, Sand Barrow Location, On-shore Transmission, Under-Sea Electricity Transmission Hub, and Paleovalley.
> 
> However, our attempts met with varying degrees of success. For instance, while we were able to gain an understanding of the Traffic Separation Schemes and Anchorage Area from TSS data, we are still awaiting further details regarding on-shore and under-sea electricity transmission, among others.
> 
> ### Datasets Acquired Independently
> Self-collection of datasets proved to be a challenging yet fruitful endeavour. We extended our data collection beyond the scope of the original study to include information about cold-water corals, essential fish habitat, different species of birds (Avian), shipping (AIS), artificial reefs, historic places, submarine cables, and sediments. Notably, data was also collected regarding bats, though this required approval from the Delaware NABat Projects leader, and some datasets like firing ranges or potential buffer zones proved elusive.
> 
> Despite this, our team diligently followed up on several unique sources of data such as the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), the USGS's Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset, and the Marine Cadastre Survey. We also made use of datasets not mentioned in Bates et al., like the NABat for bat data.

> ### Challenges in Data Collection
> Updating a decade-old study was not without its challenges. We encountered roadblocks including inaccessible, outdated, or non-existent data sources and even confidentiality agreements that prevented data sharing. In a few cases, we were unable to find relevant reports or data online, such as USACE 2005 and 2000 reports, and information on dump sites. Data collection for certain categories such as marine mammals, sea turtles, and bats was also limited due to issues with respective databases or data providers.
> 
> ### Moving Forward
> Despite the challenges, our progress has been substantial. Our efforts to build upon the work of Bates et al. have allowed us to make significant strides in updating and consolidating critical data for marine spatial planning in Delaware. This up-to-date collection will, in turn, contribute significantly to improved marine spatial planning strategies. Renewed efforts will continue to fill the gaps in existing data, while ensuring that new insights and technology continue to expand our understanding.
