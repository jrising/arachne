> 
> The agricultural sector in Africa experiences severe challenges arising from climate change (Fofana 2011, Lokonon 2018, Adeleye et al 2021), and employs 55–62% of the sub-Saharan workforce and 95% of cropland is rainfed (Trisos et al. 2022, Osabohien et al. 2020). The effects of climatic shocks (e.g., heat intensity, variable rainfall) are predicted to result in depletion of soil nutrients, low productivity, shortage of food and welfare of the African farmers (Osabohien et al. 2020, Osofur and Nnorom 2014, Hatfield et al. 2018). Estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Trisos et al. 2022) indicate that future warming will negatively affect food systems in Africa by shortening growing seasons and increasing water stress. Although yield declines for some crops may be partially compensated by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrients are not expected to keep pace, and global warming above 2°C will result in yield reductions for staple crops across most of Africa compared to 2005 yields (Trisos et al. 2022).

> Climate change presents acute challenges for Africa's agricultural sector, which employs 55-62% of the sub-Saharan workforce and relies on rainfed cropland for 95% of production (Trisos et al. 2022). Climatic shocks, including variable rainfall and heat intensity, threaten soil nutrient levels and productivity, consequently impacting food availability and farmer welfare (Osabohien et al. 2020). While rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations could partly compensate for crop yield shortfalls, they cannot prevent nutrient dilution nor yield reductions above 2°C global warming (Hatfield et al. 2018). In this scenario, staple crop yields across most of Africa will fall relative to 2005 levels (Trisos et al. 2022).
