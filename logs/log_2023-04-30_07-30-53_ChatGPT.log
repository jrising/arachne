> Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, with thinkers such as Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus. While existentialism is a diverse and complex school of thought, it generally emphasizes individual freedom, authenticity, and the subjective nature of human existence. Existentialist philosophers often grapple with questions of morality, ethics, and responsibility.
> 
> Many existentialists do not believe in universal moral values, arguing that moral judgments are subjective and contingent upon individual choices and experiences. For instance, Jean-Paul Sartre claimed that "existence precedes essence," meaning that humans are not born with predetermined moral values; rather, they must create their own values through their actions and choices.
> 
> However, existentialism is not a monolithic movement, and some existentialist thinkers have held different views on the question of universal moral values. For example, Søren Kierkegaard, often considered a precursor to existentialism, believed in the importance of a personal relationship with God as the foundation for ethical living. Kierkegaard's perspective is often classified as a form of religious existentialism.
> 
> In conclusion, while existentialism as a whole does not necessarily endorse universal moral values, individual existentialist philosophers have held diverse views on the subject. The movement is marked by an emphasis on individual freedom and responsibility, with many existentialists asserting that individuals must create their own moral values through their choices and actions.

> For those existentialists who rejected moral values, how do they justify any values, for example around the importance of authenticity?
**assistant**:
> For existentialists who rejected universal moral values, the justification of values often comes from the individual's own experience, freedom, and responsibility. In the case of authenticity, it is not a universal moral value; rather, it is a value that is derived from an individual's commitment to living life honestly and genuinely. Here are some key existentialist perspectives on authenticity and how they justify its importance:
> 
> 1. Jean-Paul Sartre: Sartre believed that humans are radically free and responsible for their own actions. He thought that when people deny their freedom and pretend that they have no choice, they are acting in "bad faith." Authenticity, for Sartre, is the recognition and acceptance of one's own freedom, making choices in line with this awareness, and taking full responsibility for the consequences of those choices. Authenticity is justified as a way to embrace one's freedom and avoid living in bad faith.
> 
> 2. Friedrich Nietzsche: Nietzsche advocated for living a life that embraces individuality and creativity, often contrasting this approach with the conformity and stagnation he saw in his contemporary society. He criticized traditional moral systems, arguing that they limited human potential. For Nietzsche, authenticity is about creating one's own values, being true to oneself, and living passionately. The justification for authenticity, in this case, comes from the pursuit of individual excellence and self-overcoming.
> 
> 3. Albert Camus: Camus focused on the concept of the absurd, which arises from the tension between humans' desire for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. In response to the absurd, Camus argued that one should embrace life, create meaning, and live with passion and authenticity. He believed that an authentic life is one lived without illusions, recognizing the absurdity of existence but refusing to succumb to despair. Authenticity is justified as a way to confront the absurd and to live life to the fullest despite its inherent meaninglessness.
> 
> In summary, while existentialists who reject universal moral values do not base their values on any fixed, external source, they justify the importance of authenticity as an individual choice, commitment, and way of living that arises from the recognition of human freedom and responsibility. Authenticity is valued as a way to embrace one's own existence, overcome limitations, and create meaning in a world without inherent purpose or meaning.
