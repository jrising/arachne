> Dear Professor James Rising
> 
> My name is Maryam Saadatmand. I successfully completed my master’s degree in Environmental Science. I ranked 2nd among undergraduate students in this field. My GPA during M.Sc was 18.81/20(4/4) and during B.Sc was 18.43/20(3.8/4). Besides, I have contributed to two published international academic papers and one pending manuscript in my field. Additionally, I have been working as an HSE supervisor at a port for about ten years.
> 
> I have the expertise and a keen interest in GIS, Heavy Metal Contamination, Risk Assessment, Climate Change, and Environmental Pollution. Furthermore, I am passionate about working on new ideas and skills to combine them with my prior knowledge. I also visited your webpage and explored your recent works and articles. Your research areas are quite interesting to me and very close to my research experiences and interests.
> 
> For further information, my CV is attached, or you can kindly view my LinkedIn/ResearchGate account.
> 
> Please let me know whether I am eligible to pursue my education toward a Ph.D. degree under your supervision.
> 
> I really appreciate your time, and I am looking forward to your kind reply.

> Dear Maryam,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Considering your strong background in Environmental Science and related research experiences, you might be a good candidate for our Ph.D. programs in Environmental Economics or Marine Policy, both of which have an interdisciplinary focus that seems to align with your research interests.
> 
> However, funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to mention my name in your statement of purpose so that your application can be considered for any available funds related to my area of research. This best applies if you are exploring themes around climate change risks, food systems, or interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
> 
> Please consider applying by the end of this calendar year so that you can be fully reviewed for funding opportunities.

> Dear Professor James Rising
> 
> I am so appreciative of your kind response and the time you spent considering my application. It is my honor to be considered as your prospective student and have a chance to study under your supervision.
> There are several points to be mentioned. First and foremost, I will be taking part in the Duolingo exam soon and will use its score for the application on the website. Second, considering my research interest I prefer the marine policy program but if you consider me for the other program, it would be my pleasure to be part of it as well. Also, I do not know if it is possible to receive an application fee waiver or not. If this can be done it would be much more straightforward for me considering the economic sanctions in my country.

> finally, I am honored and privileged to be a member of your research group and hope to be accepted for this PhD program.

> Dear Maryam,
> 
> Thank you for the additional information. I apologize for any confusion. In our Ph.D. programs, we accept either TOEFL or IELTS scores for English language proficiency. While Duolingo can be a valuable resource for language learning, we do not currently accept Duolingo exam scores as part of the application process.
> 
> Unfortunately, there are currently no more fee waivers available. I understand this poses an additional challenge for you, considering the economic conditions in your country, but this factor is out of my direct control.

> As you know I am planning to apply for my Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program under your supervision. Due to the situation of English language exams in Iran, I will not be able to report my score until January 30, which is the deadline for this program. So, do I have a chance to report this score in March? I will be grateful if you give me more time to deliver my language proficiency scores beyond the admission deadline for the program.
