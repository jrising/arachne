> The translation I have of the Myth of Er refers to "heaven", "hell", and "purgatory", but I didn't think the Greeks had these notions. Do they, and are later Christian ideas of these heavily influenced by this myth?

> In Greek mythology, the conceptualizations of the afterlife were quite different from later Christian notions of heaven, hell, and purgatory. Sometimes terminologies put forth by later translators reflect the cultural context of the translator rather than being a perfect fit for the original concepts. So, let's first take a look at the Greek viewpoints:
> 
> 1. In Plato's myth of Er, two kinds of places in the afterlife are described: a place of reward for the just, and one of punishment for the unjust, but they are not strictly equivalent to the concepts of heaven and hell as understood in Christian theology.
> 
> 2. The Greeks believed in Hades, the realm of the dead, where all mortals ended up, irrespective of their deeds. They did not generally imagine a place of eternal joy or torment that would be determined by a person's actions in life. Within Hades, however, the just might be rewarded and the wicked punished.
> 
> 3. Tartarus, mentioned in other myths as a place of punishment, is a dark abyss below Hades where the gods imprison their enemies. But again, everyone does not go there after death; it is reserved for the most severe punishments.
> 
> Now, Christian concepts of heaven, hell, and purgatory do indeed have some parallels in ancient worldviews, and some aspects of Christianity might have been influenced by pre-existing ideas. But it's more likely that they evolved from a complex web of influences including Jewish thought, Persian Zoroastrianism, and Roman religious ideas, as well as Greek philosophy. There's no direct link between Christianity and the myth of Er, though it's evident both share a kind of moralistic dualism, with rewards and punishments meted out in the afterlife based on earthly deeds.
> 
> In conclusion, the terms "heaven," "hell," and "purgatory" might not reflect the cultural and religious nuances of ancient Greek beliefs accurately. While there may indeed be shared themes or elements between the myth of Er and later Christian ideas of the afterlife, it's more accurate to view them as separate and influenced by multiple factors related to their specific cultural and religious contexts.
