> The psychologist who described the unconscious mind as an elephant was Sigmund Freud. In his theory of psychoanalysis, Freud believed that the human psyche was divided into three parts: the conscious mind, the preconscious mind, and the unconscious mind. The unconscious mind, according to Freud, was like an elephant in that it was powerful and often uncontrollable, and it influenced behavior without a person even realizing it.
