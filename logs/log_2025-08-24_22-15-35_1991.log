> A classic example of a non-repeating sequence that can be produced by a simple program is the sequence of prime numbers. The sequence of prime numbers is infinite and non-repeating, but the program to generate them is relatively simple:

> 2. Iterate through natural numbers, starting from 2.
> 3. For each number, check if it is divisible by any known prime (up to its square root).
> 4. If it is not divisible by any known prime, it is a prime; add it to your list of primes.
> 5. Because prime numbers do not repeat and the sequence continues indefinitely, this meets your criteria.
