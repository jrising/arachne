> ---
> Coastal Resiliency was defined as “the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions” (Sutton- Grier et al., 2015)
> White House- Executive Order 13653 definition 
> 3 core components defined by NOAA
> Society, economy, environment
> Difference between resilient infrastructure and resilient socio-economic systems (Almutairi et al., 2020)
> Established community organizations help communities recover after flooding and storm events
> Two different ways to think about coastal resilience projects: hard and soft (Jarret & Davies, 2020)
> “Hard” Projects: (Jarret & Davies, 2020; Polk et al., 2021)
> Also considered built or gray projects by Sutton-Grier et al., 2015
> The most traditional way to think about coastal resiliency
> Includes raising buildings and roads; more effective drainage systems; sea walls; levees; etc (Jarret & Davies, 2020; Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Hamin et al., 2018) 
> Effective communication and utility systems that work even during disaster events (Almutairi et al., 2020)
> Benefits: (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Hamin et al., 2018; Polk et al., 2021)
> Ready to go as soon as they are built
> Years of expertise and experience with these types of projects
> Well understood how effective they are
> Drawbacks: (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Hamin et al., 2018; Polk et al., 2021)
> Cannot adapt with climate change once constructed 
> Will fail at some point, needs maintenance
> False sense of security
> May cause environmental degradation
> Costs: 
> One study in 2018 estimated an installation cost of $6500 to $9800 per meter and annual maintenance costs of up to 1710/m/year (Sutton-Grier et al., 2018)
> looking at living shoreline
> No additional ecological benefits
> “Soft” Projects (Jarret & Davies, 2020)
> Also considered “natural” projects by Sutton- Grier et al., 2015
> Ensuring that wetlands, dunes, barrier islands, seagrass beds, mangroves, etc are healthy and functioning ecosystems
> Benefits: (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Hamin et al., 2018; Polk et al., 2021)
> Can adapt with climate change
> Co-benefits usually through fishery products and water quality
> Can usually self-recover without human intervention
> More cost-effective
> Drawbacks: (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Hamin et al., 2018; Polk et al., 2021)
> Takes a long time for recovery and for benefits to be seen
> Best practices are not always established and can vary between areas/communities
> More limited expertise and experience on their effectiveness and “construction”
> Make take up more space than traditional built methods

> Executive Summary:
> 
> - Coastal Resiliency is the ability to anticipate, adapt to, and recover from disruptions, with three core components: society, economy, environment. 
> - Two distinct types of coastal resilience projects exist: hard (built or gray) projects, and soft (natural) projects.
> - Hard projects include building modifications, drainage systems, sea walls, etc., and are known for their immediate readiness, vast expertise, and understood effectiveness.
> - The drawbacks of hard projects are that they cannot adapt with climate change, will fail and need maintenance, and may cause environmental degradation. Costs are high, with an estimated installation cost of $6500 to $9800 per meter.
> - Soft projects focus on maintaining healthy ecosystems such as wetlands, dunes, and mangroves, and are more adaptable to climate change. They also have co-benefits through fishery products and water quality, and are generally more cost-effective.
> - Soft projects have challenges too; recovery and benefits can take time, best practices vary, and there is less experience and expertise available. These projects may also take up more space.
> - Hybrid projects combine built and natural components, providing benefits from both systems, but are currently not well understood and face challenges with permitting and cost-benefit analysis.
> - Moving further inland is another adaptation method for enhancing resilience.
> 
> Conclusion:
> 
> - Investing in coastal resilience, through hard, soft, or hybrid projects, contributes to the preparedness and adaptability of Delaware's coastal economy in the face of changing conditions and potential disruptions.
> - While hard projects provide immediate protection, they do not adapt well to climate change, need regular maintenance, and may have environmental impacts. Soft projects, while adaptable and providing additional ecological benefits, require more space and time to establish.
> - Hybrid projects offer potential for blending the strengths of both hard and soft projects, though more understanding and expertise are needed.
> - The high cost of hard projects, alongside their inability to adapt to climate change, suggests the need for investing in more adaptive, cost-effective strategies like soft and hybrid projects.
> - The success of these projects and methods relies heavily on established community organizations and effective communication systems. Hence, these systems should be strengthened to support resilience measures.
> - Exploring the concept of moving further inland, as an additional adaptation method, can provide further options for enhancing coastal resilience.

> Understanding the dynamism of the coastal economy is a prerequisite for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing economic potential. Inherent in its character are rapid changes propelled by both internal and external forces. To fully grasp this economic complexity, it is imperative to encapsulate these forces into a single measure. Hence, the conception of a "Coastal Barometer" is an important step towards gaining a holistic understanding of the coastal economy's health.
> 
> The coastal economy is subject to a spectrum of economic risks and opportunities. Infrastructure and assets are continually vulnerable to flooding and sea-level rise. Tourism, a vital sector, is subject to fluctuations due to shifting behaviors. Additionally, the natural environment faces mounting threats from climate change. However, within these challenges lie significant economic opportunities. As appreciation for beautiful environments escalates, and businesses adapt to the changing needs of an aging population, new avenues for growth become apparent.
> 
> Therefore, it is essential to realize that a healthy economy is not merely prosperous but resilient, armed to mitigate risks, and ready to seize the ensuing opportunities. The complexity of the coastal economy, laden with diverse risks and opportunities, makes it challenging to capture its entirety within a single metric. Yet, it is not an insurmountable task. The methodologies born from sustainable development and inclusive accounting offer a robust foundation for encapsulating the economic underpinnings of future prosperity.
> 
> A "Coastal Barometer" could serve as an invaluable tool for Delaware's coasts, offering a regularly updated dashboard of indices on the coastal economy's health. This tool wouldn't simply reflect the immediate condition of the coastal economy but would also elucidate its connections to the broader state and national economies. In essence, the Barometer would offer an integrated, up-to-date snapshot of the economy's overall health, spanning from the local to the national level.
> 
> The proposed Coastal Barometer is more than a mere statistical index; it is a pathway towards comprehensive economic understanding. By making these data readily available, coastal community officials will be better equipped to support infrastructure development and make more informed land-use decisions. Understanding the scale of the contributions from coastal-related activities also helps planners forecast the effects of new developments more accurately, ensuring that infrastructure is appropriately sized.
> 
> Thus, the Coastal Barometer serves as a critical instrument, not only monitoring the pulse of the coastal economy but also guiding its future, making it a potential cornerstone of sustainable and inclusive development for Delaware.
