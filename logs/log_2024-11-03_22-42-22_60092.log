> before it must be replaced, at a cost of about three times the ave rage

> were able to convince national public officials not to enforce that provi·
> sion. But before we discuss this problem concerning the enforcemen t of
> entry rules, let us examine the system of appropriation rules that Mawelle
> fishers had devised.
> The appropriation rules in operation in Mawelle involve naming all the
> nets and placing them into a sequence. Each net owner is aware of the
> sequence of nets immediately preceding and following his net. The beach
> is divided into fWO launching sites. one on the harbor side and one on the
> rock side (Figure 5 . 1). A net may first be deployed on the harbor side
> anytime during the day after the net preceding it has been used. As illusmu('d
> on Table 5. 1 , on�c a net has worked its way up in the sequence 50
> as to have had a dawn run on the harbor side. the net is next eligible for
> the dawn run on the rock side. "Subsequently, it may be used on the rock
> side at any time of the day once the net immediately following it in the
> sequence has been used" (Alexander 1 982, p. 145).
> The Mawelle fishers provide a coherent explanation for why they use
> this complex set of authority rules. rather than a simple rotation system, to
> equalize the opportunity to make a big catch. Four environmental or
> technological considerations affect the problem of equalizing access: (1)
> The harbor side produces the really big catches. but the rock side is more
> consistently productive when there are fewer fish. (2) The first catch of the

> a disproporrionate amount of the growth occurring among beach-seining
> families (Alexander 1 982, p. 204). That disproportionate growth was due
> to an earlier labor shortage that had led the heads of beach·seining families

> net they each receive 11168th. (Alexander 1 982, p. 204)
> In 1 933, legislation was enacted requiring the registration of beach·
> seines throughout the country. Along the southern coast, where share
> systems were the dominant forms of ownership, the "government limited
> the number of nets at any site to those in use in 1933 and codilied the
> criteria for allocating access to the water" (Alexander 1982, p. 206).
> Thirty-two nets were registered in 1 93.3. " he registry reveals that almost
> all fishers owned a single share in one net. The legislation allowed individuals
> who did not inherit access rights to the fishery to purchase shares
> in established nets. That opened access to the fishery to persons outside the
> limited number of families that previously had shared access to the use of
> beach seines on the Mawelle beach. Opening access outside the original
> kinship groups would not have affected the number of nets competing for
> access if the provision limiting the number of nets to the number in use in

> IS we shall see.
> During the early 1940s, the construction of a new road linking Mawelle
> to marketing centers, the const:,uction of an ice factory nearby, and the
> marketing efforts of the Fish Sales Union greatly increased the demand for
> and market value of fresh fish. Prices for fish increased fourfold between
> 1938 and 1 94 1 (Alexander 1 982., p. 210). Then the pressure to introduce
> new nets really gained momentum. By 1 945, 71 nets were in operation. At

> New entrepreneurs began to buy shares in more than one net and to hire
> wage laborers to work their shares. By purchasing shares in nets well

> received a profit only in those years when his net operated during the

> share was less than a subsistence-level income. Poorer owners of single
> shares began to sell their shares to others. A fisher who owned one share

> or less.
> Thus, the ownership patterns were shifting at the same time that the

> to work their shares. Further, the heads of several factions in the
> village purchased shares both for the economic return they could obtain
> and as a means of providing work for their loyal followers.

> was supported not only by the fishers who owned single shares and had
