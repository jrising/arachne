**assistant**:
> Performing an ANOVA by hand involves understanding how the sum of squares (SS) values are computed. The ANOVA partition the variance of your data into components associated with the factors in the model and the residual error. Here's how to calculate the "Sum Sq" values:
> 
> 1. **Total Sum of Squares (TSS):** It measures the total variance in the response variable. It's calculated as the sum of the squared differences between each observation and the overall mean:
> 
>    \[
>    \text{TSS} = \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2
>    \]
> 
>    where \( y_i \) is an observed value, and \( \bar{y} \) is the overall mean of observations.
> 
> 2. **Sum of Squares for a Factor (SS\_Factor):** It measures the variance explained by each factor. You calculate it for `scenario` and `factor(run_id)` separately.
> 
>    - For `scenario`:
>      \[
>      \text{SS}_{\text{scenario}} = \sum n_j (\bar{y}_{j} - \bar{y})^2
>      \]
>      where \( n_j \) is the number of observations in level \( j \), and \( \bar{y}_j \) is the mean of observations within level \( j \).
> 
>    - For `factor(run_id)`:
>      \[
>      \text{SS}_{\text{run\_id}} = \sum m_k (\bar{y}_{k} - \bar{y})^2
>      \]
>      where \( m_k \) is the number of observations in run \( k \), and \( \bar{y}_k \) is the mean of observations within run \( k \).
> 
> 3. **Residual Sum of Squares (SSR):** It shows the variance not explained by the model (residual error).
> 
>    \[
>    \text{SSR} = \sum (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
>    \]
> 
>    where \( \hat{y}_i \) are the predicted values from your model.
> 
> Given the information from your ANOVA table:
> - The Sum Sq for `scenario` (6.074344) corresponds to the variance explained by the `scenario`.
> - The Sum Sq for `factor(run_id)` (16.241916) represents the explained variance by the run IDs.
> - The Residual Sum Sq (1.047381) is the unexplained variance.
> 
> Together, the SS values add up to the Total Sum of Squares (TSS), i.e., \( \text{TSS} = \text{SS}_{\text{scenario}} + \text{SS}_{\text{run\_id}} + \text{SSR} \).
> 
> In practical terms, you rarely need to do this computation by hand when using R or similar tools, but understanding the calculation gives insights into interpreting ANOVA results correctly. If you have further details on your dataset, I might help you simulate the calculations.
