> It looks like your R Shiny and Leaflet setup should work, especially since accessing a tile directly in the browser shows it's available. Here are a few potential troubleshooting steps and adjustments to ensure everything is configured properly:
> 
> 1. **Check Paths and Ensure Static Files are Served**:
>    Make sure that the `static` directory containing your tiles is correctly set up to be served by your R Shiny application.
> 
>    ```r
>    shiny::addResourcePath("static", "path/to/your/static")
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Verify Tile URL Pattern and Attribution**:
>    Ensure the URL template and attribution are specified correctly. The `{z}/{x}/{y}.png` placeholders are important for Leaflet to access the correct tile.
> 
> 3. **Browser Console for Errors**:
>    Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to check for any errors related to loading the tiles. This can give clues if something went wrong with the requests.
> 
> 4. **Using the Correct Protocol**:
>    Ensure that your URLs are correctly formed, especially in cases where you're using `http` or `https`. This is particularly important in various deployment environments.
> 
> Here is an enhanced version of your code with `addResourcePath` and some additional logging to print out errors for further debugging:
> 
> ```r
> library(shiny)
> library(leaflet)
> 
> ui <- fluidPage(
>     leafletOutput("slosh")
> )
> 
> server <- function(input, output, session) {
>     # Make sure your static directory is correctly served
>     addResourcePath("static", "path/to/your/static")
> 
>     output$slosh <- renderLeaflet({
>         leaflet() %>%
>             addTiles() %>%
>             setView(-75.4110209, 38.6882882, zoom = 10) %>%
>             addTiles(
>                 urlTemplate = "static/slosh-cat1/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
>                 attribution = "Flooding inundation"
>             ) %>%
>             onRender("function(el, x) {
>                 this.on('tileerror', function(error, tile){
>                     console.error('Tile error: ', error, tile);
>                 });
>             }")
>     })
> }
> 
> shinyApp(ui, server)
> ```
> 
> ### Additional Debugging Steps:
> 
> 1. **Check All Tile Levels**:
>    Make certain all your tiles are generated for each zoom level, from the highest to the lowest.
>    
> 2. **Cross-Origin Issues**:
>    Sometimes tiles don't load if cross-origin requests are restricted. Make sure your server setup (if applicable) allows cross-origin requests.
> 
> 3. **Console Logging**:
>    Use JavaScript to log tile errors. The `onRender` function within Leaflet will capture and log tile errors to the browser console, which can help identify any specific issues with tile loading.
> 
> By implementing these steps, you should be able to identify the discrepancy between the working HTML example and your R Shiny implementation and ensure that your raster tiles display correctly.
**user**:
> It looks like the tiles are misnumbered somehow. I see tiles with filenames 10/297/630.png through 632.png, but the console shows requests for tiles 10/297/391.png through 393.png. But when I look at traffic from the example HTML, it does get the numbers right.
**assistant**:
> It sounds like the issue may indeed be related to how tiles are indexed or how the tile generation process has been configured. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this problem:
> 
> ### 1. **Verify Tile Generation Process**
> 
> - **Check Gdal2Tiles Settings**: Ensure that when you generated the tiles using `gdal2tiles`, the output directory structure and naming conventions were correctly set. You can rerun the command with explicit parameters, if necessary, to ensure the tiles are numbered correctly.
> 
> ### 2. **Examine the Zoom Level**
> 
> - **Tile Zoom Levels**: Make sure your application is looking for tiles at the correct zoom level (10 in your case). If tiles for level 10 are not generated correctly, you may need to regenerate them or adjust the zoom in your Leaflet setup.
> 
> ### 3. **Console Logs for Debugging**
> 
> - **Compare Requests**: Use the network tab in your browser’s developer console to compare the tile requests made by your Shiny app and the example HTML. This can give you further insight into how the requests differ and why the wrong tiles are being requested.
> 
> ### 4. **Custom Tile Load Logic**
> 
> If the tile requests are still mismatched, you can implement a workaround by creating a function to adjust tile requests. For example, you can intercept tile requests and modify them based on your knowledge of how the tiles are structured.
> 
> ### 5. **Test Direct URL Access**
> 
> - **Direct Access to URLs**: Start by typing in the full URL for a tile in your web browser (like `http://127.0.0.1:5782/static/slosh-cat1/10/297/630.png`) to ensure it loads correctly. Doing this for various tile coordinates will show you which tiles actually exist on the server.
> 
> ### 6. **Sample Leaflet Code Adaptation**
> 
> Here’s a variation on your leaflet output code that adds logic to verify and adjust the tile URL, though this might require additional JavaScript if you want to manipulate it dynamically. 
> 
> ```r
> output$slosh <- renderLeaflet({
>     leaflet() %>%
>         addTiles() %>%
>         setView(-75.4110209, 38.6882882, zoom = 10) %>%
>         addTiles(urlTemplate = "static/slosh-cat1/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", 
>                  attribution = "Flooding inundation") %>%
>         onRender("function() {
>             this.on('tileload', function(e) {
>                 console.log('Loading tile: ' + e.tile.src);
>             });
>             this.on('tileerror', function(error, tile){
>                 console.error('Tile error: ', error, tile);
>             });
>         }")
> })
> ```
> 
> ### 7. **Implementation of a Tile Cache Strategy**
> 
> If your tiles are being accessed over a network, consider implementing caching strategies or allow for some flexibility in tile naming and mapping if you're generating them dynamically.
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> With these steps, you should be able to pinpoint the inconsistency with tile indexing and ensure your R Shiny application loads the correct raster tiles. If you discover that the problem persists after all checks, regenerating the tiles with consistent and correctly indexed settings might be the best path forward.
