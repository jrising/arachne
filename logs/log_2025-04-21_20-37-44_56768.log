> I have a directory tree of pdfs, and I would like to create a low-resolution version of each one. I installed ImageMagick, so I can say:
> magick convert -density 150 figure.pdf figure-lowres.png
> But how do I do this for every pdf in the tree?
**assistant**:
> You can use a combination of `find` and a `for` loop in a shell script to apply the `magick convert` command to every PDF file in your directory tree. Here’s a basic script that should work for you:
> 
> ```bash
> #!/bin/bash
> 
> # Base directory to start from
> base_dir="."
> 
> # Find all PDFs and convert them to low-resolution PNGs
> find "$base_dir" -type f -name "*.pdf" | while read pdf_file; do
>     # Get the directory of the current PDF file
>     dir=$(dirname "$pdf_file")
>     
>     # Get the base name without the extension
>     base_name=$(basename "$pdf_file" .pdf)
>     
>     # Define the output file
>     output_file="$dir/${base_name}-lowres.png"
>     
>     echo "Converting $pdf_file to $output_file"
>     
>     # Perform the conversion
>     magick convert -density 150 "$pdf_file" "$output_file"
> done
> ```
> 
> Save this script to a file, for example `convert_pdfs.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x convert_pdfs.sh`, and then run it from the command line:
> 
> ```bash
> ./convert_pdfs.sh
> ```
> 
> This script will traverse the directory tree starting from the current directory (`"."`), find all PDF files, and convert each one to a low-resolution PNG, placing the output file in the same directory as the original, with "-lowres" appended to the filename. Adjust the `-density` and `-quality` parameters if you need a different resolution or quality.
> 
> Before you run the script, make sure you're in the correct starting directory, or change `base_dir` in the script above to specify a different starting point.
**user**:
> Actually, can I only do this for files greater than 1 MB?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can modify the script to include a condition that checks the file size before converting. Here’s how you can do it:
> 
> ```bash
> #!/bin/bash
> 
> # Base directory to start from
> base_dir="."
> 
> # Find all PDFs larger than 1 MB and convert them to low-resolution PNGs
> find "$base_dir" -type f -name "*.pdf" -size +1M | while read pdf_file; do
>     # Get the directory of the current PDF file
>     dir=$(dirname "$pdf_file")
>     
>     # Get the base name without the extension
>     base_name=$(basename "$pdf_file" .pdf)
>     
>     # Define the output file
>     output_file="$dir/${base_name}-lowres.png"
>     
>     echo "Converting $pdf_file to $output_file"
>     
>     # Perform the conversion
>     magick convert -density 150 "$pdf_file" "$output_file"
> done
> ```
> 
> ### Key Changes:
> - I added `-size +1M` to the `find` command, which ensures that only PDF files larger than 1 MB are selected for conversion.
> 
> To run this script:
> 1. Save it to a file, such as `convert_large_pdfs.sh`.
> 2. Make it executable with `chmod +x convert_large_pdfs.sh`.
> 3. Execute it from the command line with `./convert_large_pdfs.sh`.
> 
> This will only convert PDF files greater than 1 MB in size.
