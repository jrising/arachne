**user**:
> I am developing a grant proposal where there are multiple policy documents related to data management provided by the funder (actually, multiple funders). Here they are:
> 
> 1. Belmont Forum Policy
> ===
> Data Policies and Principles
> Recognizing the crucial role of open and effective data and information exchange to the Belmont Challenge, the Belmont Forum adopted open Data Policy and Principles based on the recommendations from the Community Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP) at its 2015 annual meeting of Principals in Oslo, Norway. The policy signals a commitment by funders of global environmental change research to increase access to scientific data, a step widely recognized as essential to making informed decisions in the face of rapid changes affecting the Earth’s environment.
> 
> Belmont Forum Data Policy and Principles
> The Belmont Forum adopts this data policy and the following principles to widen access to data and promote its long-term preservation in global change research; help improve data management and exploitation; coordinate and integrate disparate organizational and technical elements; fill critical global e-infrastructure gaps; share best practices; and foster new data literacy.
> 
> The Belmont Forum recognizes that significant advances in open access to data have been achieved and implementation of this policy and these principles requires support by a highly skilled workforce. The Belmont Forum recommends a broad-based training and education curriculum as an integral part of research programs and encourages researchers to be aware of, and plan for, the costs of data intensive research. The Belmont Forum’s ambition is that this policy and these principles will take positive steps toward establishing a global, interoperable e-infrastructure based on cost-effective solutions that can help enable actionable and societally beneficial science.
> 
> Data should be:
> 
> Discoverable through catalogues and search engines
> Accessible as open data by default, and made available with minimum time delay
> Understandable in a way that allows researchers—including those outside the discipline of origin—to use them
> Manageable and protected from loss for future use in sustainable, trustworthy repositories
> The Belmont Forum and its members will support and promote this data policy and principles with the intent of making these data principles enforceable over time.
> 
> “This policy of openness paves the way for science and funding agencies collaborating internationally to reinforce the excellence and integrity of science,” said Kurt Vandenberghe, then co-chair of the Belmont Forum. “It will facilitate innovation through taking advantage of research data and results and, most of all, it will enhance global scientific collaboration and science diplomacy as essential conditions for developing more sustainable societies.”
> 
> Additional Detail
> The Policy and Principles closely follow the data principles promoted in the CSIP:
> 
> Research data must be:
> 
> Discoverable through catalogues and search engines, with data access and use conditions, including licenses, clearly indicated. Data should have appropriate persistent, unique and resolvable identifiers.
> Accessible by default, and made available with minimum time delay, except where international and national policies or legislation preclude the sharing of data as Open Data. Data sources should always be cited.
> Understandable and interoperable in a way that allows researchers, including those outside the discipline of origin, to use them. Preference should be given to non-proprietary international and community standards via data e-infrastructures that facilitate access, use and interpretation of data. Data must also be reusable and thus require proper contextual information and metadata, including provenance, quality and uncertainty indicators. Provision should be made for multiple languages.
> Manageable and protected from loss for future use in sustainable, trustworthy repositories with data management policies and plans for all data at the project and institutional levels. Metrics should be exploited to facilitate the ability to measure return on investment, and can be used to implement incentive schemes for researchers, as well as provide measures of data quality.
> Supported by a highly skilled workforce and a broad-based training and education curriculum as an integral part of research programs.
> For additional details or to get involved, please contact the Secretariat.
> 
> Dataset Catalog
> A number of Belmont Forum supported projects have made datasets open access in line with the Belmont Forum’s Data Policies and Principles. It is hoped that researchers will take advantage of the open access datasets to enhance scientific collaboration and advance the Belmont Challenge.

> 2. The FAIR Data Principles
> ===
> Preamble
> One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science is to facilitate knowledge discovery by assisting humans and machines in their discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and their associated algorithms and workflows. Here, we describe FAIR – a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  The term FAIR was launched at a Lorentz workshop in 2014, the resulting  FAIR principles were published in 2016.
> 
> To be Findable:
> F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
> F2. data are described with rich metadata.
> F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.
> F4. metadata specify the data identifier.
> 
> To be Accessible:
> A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.
> A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.
> A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.
> A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.
> 
> To be Interoperable:
> I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
> I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
> I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.
> 
> To be Re-usable:
> R1. (meta)data have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
> R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
> R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.
> R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.

> 3. NSF Policy
> ===
> Principles and Implementation Approach	Investigators are expected to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of work under NSF grants. Grantees are expected to encourage and facilitate such sharing.
> 
> Data Management Planning	Proposals must include a document of no more than two pages uploaded under "Data Management Plan" in the supplementary documentation section of FastLane. This supplementary document should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results (see Chapter XI.D.4), and may include: the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project; the standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies); policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements; policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives; and plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them. Data management requirements and plans specific to the Directorate, Office, Division, Program, or other NSF unit, relevant to a proposal are available at: http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp. If guidance specific to the program is not available, then the requirements established in this section apply. Simultaneously submitted collaborative proposals and proposals that include subawards are a single unified project and should include only one supplemental combined Data Management Plan, regardless of the number of non-lead collaborative proposals or subawards included. A valid Data Management Plan may include only the statement that no detailed plan is needed, as long as the statement is accompanied by a clear justification. Proposers who feel that the plan cannot fit within the limit of two pages may use part of the 15-page Project Description for additional data management information. Proposers are advised that the Data Management Plan must not be used to circumvent the 15-page Project Description limitation. The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as an integral part of the proposal, considered under Intellectual Merit or Broader Impacts or both, as appropriate for the scientific community of relevance.

> 4. RCN:
> ===
> Principles and Implementation Approach	The Research Council’s Policy on Open Access to Research Data aims to ensure that such data are accessible to relevant users, on equal terms, and at the lowest possible cost. The guidelines in the policy apply to all data generated by projects funded by the Research Council – with a few exceptions. The policy is formulated as a set of recommendations – not requirements. The Research Council’s various funding instruments will be adapted to accommodate the principles in the policy. One possible measure is to introduce a requirement that research projects incorporate data management plans. The Research Council would use these plans as a basis for accepting data archiving costs as part of the operational expenses of funded projects. In addition, the Research Council will focus on encouraging the establishment of well-designed infrastructure for data storage and data management, in part through the National Financing Initiative for Research Infrastructure.
> 
> Exclusions and Limitations in Policy Approach	Some data may not be made openly accessible as a matter of course. Data must not be made openly accessible if doing so could pose a threat to personal or national security or conflict with the applicable statutory framework regarding the protection of personal privacy or other legal provisions. Data that have commercial value and are generated in projects in which a company is the contractual partner with the Research Council may be exempted from the general principle of open access. In these cases, it is recommended that the data are made available after a certain period of time, for instance after three or five years. Data that are highly impractical or costly to make accessible may also be exempted from the general principle of open access. There are a variety of challenges associated with making some datasets openly accessible. The reasons for restricting access include: Security concerns When open access to the data may threaten personal or national security, the datasets must not be made openly accessible. Sensitive personal data When open access to the data conflicts with the applicable statutory framework regarding the protection of personal privacy, the datasets must not be made openly accessible. Other legal factors When open access to the data conflicts with other legal provisions, the datasets must not be made openly accessible. Commercial factors Data that have commercial value and are generated in projects in which a company is the contractual partner with the Research Council may be exempted from the general principle of open access. In these cases, it is recommended that the data are made available after a certain period of time, preferably after three or five years.	 	 
> When Data are to be Publicly Shared	3.0 Research data should be made accessible at an early stage. 3.1 The data used as the basis for scientific articles should be made accessible as soon as possible, and never later than at the time of publication. 3.2 Other data that may be of interest for other research should be made accessible within a reasonable amount of time, and never later than three years after the project has concluded.	 	 
> How Data are to be Publically Shared	The Research Council has drawn up a set of guidelines for the archiving, dissemination and sharing of research data. The guidelines will be followed up through the Research Council’s research funding instruments and through the National Financing Initiative for Research Infrastructure. 1.0 Research data should be stored/archived in a safe and secure manner. 1.1 The data should be stored in secure archives, either in a central repository at the relevant institution or in national archives. 2.0 Research data should be made accessible for reuse. 2.1 Research data should be made accessible to all relevant users, on equal terms, as long as there are no legal, ethical or security-related reasons to preclude this. 6.0 Research data should be made accessible at the lowest possible cost. 6.1 Metadata should be made accessible at no charge and be published in a way so that they may be harvested and used in research data searches. 6.2 Research data should preferably be made accessible at no charge. 6.3 The price of access to research data should never be higher than the actual costs of making them available.	 	 
> Metadata and/or Documentation to be Included with Data	4.0 Research data should be accompanied by standardised metadata. 4.1 The metadata should enable others to search for and use the data. 4.2 The metadata should follow international standards. 4.3 The metadata should describe the quality of the data. Metadata should be made accessible at no charge and be published in a way so that they may be harvested and used in research data searches.
> 
> Terms of Data ‘Licensing” (e.g. Re-use/Re-distribution /Derivatives)	Research data should be provided with a license for access, reuse and redistribution. 5.1 The license should be internationally recognised. 5.2 The license should set as few restrictions as possible on the access, reuse and redistribution of the data.	 	 
> Data Management Planning	7.0 Research data should be provided with a long-term plan. 7.1 A plan should be prepared for the management of data that are considered to have longterm value. 7.2 The projects should specifically address how research data that are not considered to have long-term value should be managed, or if relevant destroyed, after a certain period of time.

> ### **Ethics & Compliance**
> - **Legal Compliance**: Adhere to all applicable national and international policies, laws, and guidelines concerning data sharing and openness.
> - **Ethical Considerations**: Consider the ethical implications of data sharing, particularly for sensitive data, and plan accordingly.
> 
> ### **Licensing**
> - **Clear Licensing**: Attach clear, accessible licenses to data for reuse, redistribution, and the creation of derivatives, preferring internationally recognized licenses with minimal restrictions.
> 
> ### **Skill Development**
> - **Education & Training**: Encourage and support the development of skills in data management, sharing, and preservation among research team members.
> 
> ### **Cost Management**
> - **Accessibility at Low Cost**: Strive to make data as freely available as possible, keeping access costs no higher than the actual costs of dissemination.
> 
> By focusing on these highlighted areas within your data management practices, your Co-PIs should be well-equipped to develop their data outputs in compliance with the diverse requirements of your funders.
