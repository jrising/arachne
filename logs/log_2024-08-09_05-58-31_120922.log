**assistant**:
> I apologize for any confusion, but I'm an AI text-based model which means I can't create visual content such as pie charts. However, I can guide you on how to make one.
> 
> To create a pie chart you need a graphical software or a spreadsheet application, such as MS Excel or Google Sheets, both of which have visual tools available. Here's how you can make a pie chart using this tools:
> 
> 1. Insert your numbers into an available column (for instance column A), where each number occupies a different cell (A1: 2100, A2: 2212, A3: 580).
> 
> 2. Then highlight the cells with the numbers.
> 
> 3. Go to the 'Insert' tab in the menu and select 'Chart'.
> 
> 4. Then choose 'Pie Chart' from the list.
> 
> That's it! Your pie chart should be displayed on screen. Do remember that numbers in a pie chart represent parts of a whole, so in your case the whole sum is 4892 (2100 + 2212 + 580) and each number would signify a portion of this total.
