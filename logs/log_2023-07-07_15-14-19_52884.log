> This statement describes my research, teaching, and service activities since finishing my PhD in 2015. In this time I was a post-doctoral fellow at University of California Berkeley for 9 months from 2015-2016 and since then have been an Assistant Professor at the University of California Davis. 
> Since finishing my PhD in September 2015 I have developed a research program that bridges climate science and environmental economics in order to better characterize and quantify the costs of climate change. I have published 18 peer reviewed journal articles since my PhD, including ones that have appeared in high-impact science journals (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Climate Change, Environmental Research Letters) and top agricultural and environmental economics journals (American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy) and successfully obtained grant funding from the National Science Foundation (one award of $750,000 as lead-PI, one of $2.8 million as co-PI). Recognition of my research accomplishments includes 28 invited talks at conferences or departmental seminars. My undergraduate and graduate teaching, across 5 different classes, focuses on building general skills in quantitative analysis and accessible, applied instruction in environmental policy analysis. I mentor graduate students in multiple graduate groups and have contributed to the establishment of a new graduate program in Environmental Policy and Management. I work to communicate my work on climate change costs to the public and policy makers through public speaking events, op-ed and policy brief writing, and consultation with federal agencies.

> This statement describes my research, teaching, and service activities since January 2018. During this period, I have held an Assistant Professorial Research Fellow position at the Gratham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics (2018 - 2020) and an Assistant Professor position at the School of Marine Science and Policy (SMSP), at the University of Delaware (2021 - present). I completed my Ph.D. in 2015 in Sustainable Development at Columbia University, advised by Dr. Upmanu Lall, and help post-doctoral positions at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. I continue to be engaged in research partnerships from these years, some of which resulted in publications and funded research prior to 2018, as reflected on my CV, but I focus here on accomplishments after my time as a post-doc.
> 
> I am an environmental economist and an interdisciplinary computational modeler, and I study how integrated economic-environmental systems function and how they can be better managed.  My research revolves around the impacts of climate change and spatiotemporal features of water-energy-food nexus. Both GRI and SMSP are interdisciplinary institutions, and I regularly collaborate with climate scientists, hydrologists, process-based modelers, data scientists, political economists, and macroeconomists, and my expertise allows me to contribute perspectives, expertise, and quantitative methods from multiple fields. I regularly translate my research to policy contexts, and my research, teaching, and service has intertwined in recent years.

> This statement accounts for my research, teaching, and service activities commencing in January 2018. During this timeline, I have served as an Assistant Professorial Research Fellow at the Gratham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics (2018 - 2020) and occupied an Assistant Professor position at the School of Marine Science and Policy (SMSP), at the University of Delaware (2021 - present). I procured my Ph.D. in 2015 in Sustainable Development from Columbia University, guided by Dr. Upmanu Lall, and held post-doctoral responsibilities at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. Although I accomplished noteworthy research contributions and procurements prior to 2018, this statement's focus lies exclusively with my achievements following my tenure as a post-doc.

> As an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational modeler, my research probes the functioning and management of integrated economic-environmental systems. My studies encompass the impacts of climate change and the intricacy of the water-energy-food nexus in varied spatial and temporal scales. Collaborations are frequently a part of my endeavors at both GRI and SMSP where contributors range from climate scientists through political economists to macroeconomists. I do not hesitate to employ my expertise in multiple fields to contribute quantitative methods and unique perspectives in interdisciplinary dialogs. My research is often extended to policy contexts, imbuing my teaching and service with relevant real-world engagement.
