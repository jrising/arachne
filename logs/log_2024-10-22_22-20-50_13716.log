> The field that studies policy-making under uncertainty is known as "Decision Science" or "Decision Analysis." This multidisciplinary field incorporates elements from economics, statistics, psychology, and operations research to address complex decision-making scenarios where uncertainty is a significant factor. Additionally, "Robust Decision Making" and "Adaptive Policy-Making" are frameworks within this field that specifically focus on developing policies that can perform well across a wide range of uncertain future conditions. These approaches are especially relevant in areas like climate change policy, where uncertainty about future states is a critical consideration.
