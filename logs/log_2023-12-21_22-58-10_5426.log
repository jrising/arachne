**user**:
> I am currently making a map display from matplotlib with plt.show(). I want to save this to a web-readable file now. How do I do that?
**assistant**:
> You can save the current figure using `plt.savefig()`, which can write to various formats including PNG, PDF, SVG, and JPEG.
> 
> Hereâ€™s how to save it as a PNG file, which can easily be read on the web:
> 
> ```python
> plt.savefig('MyMap.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
> ```
> 
> The `'MyMap.png'` parameter is the filename. You can enter the path to your file if you want to put it in a specific location.
> 
> The `dpi=300` parameter specifies the output resolution (dots per square inch). You can adjust this depending on how big you want your image to be and what resolution you need.
> 
> The `bbox_inches='tight'` parameter can be used to fit the bounds of the image to the plot.
> 
> Before calling `plt.show()`, you should call `plt.savefig()`. Once the `plt.show()` command is executed, a new figure with a different memory id is created. As a result, changes you make to the figure object after calling `plt.show()`, such as saving with `plt.savefig()`, will not be reflected in the output.
> 
> So, your code may look like this:
> 
> ```python
> # Your code to create your plot here...
> 
> # Save the figure as PNG file
> plt.savefig('MyMap.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
> 
> # Then you can display your plot
> plt.show()
> ```
> 
> Remember, you will need to import Matplotlib module at the beginning:
> 
> ```python
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> ```
