**user**:
> Is there a way to export the full history changes list of a file in google drive? I don't see a way in the interface, but perhaps with the API?
**assistant**:
> I'm afraid the Google Drive API doesn't expose full file revision history in the details needed to understand all historical changes. 
> 
> The [Revisions resource](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/revisions) in Google Drive API provides information about revisions made to a file, such as who made the edit, and the time of the revision. However, it doesn't include specifics about what changes were enacted in each revision (like what was added, altered, or deleted from a document).
> 
> Therefore, while you could technically export some metadata about the fileâ€™s revision history (who changed it and when), using the Google Drive API, the ability to export a track-changes style log of what content in the file specifically was changed is not currently supported directly by the Google Drive API or interface.
> 
> The recommended practice to track changes or compare versions is to use 'Suggesting' mode inside the Document when multiple people are editing, or use 'Version History' to see the versions of the document at different points in time. If you need to track specific changes in a format outside of Google Docs, you might need to copy the versions you're interested in and use a different tool to see the differences between them, such as a 'diff' tool designed for the file type in question.
