**user**:
> I'm making a apple and pear pie with a pecan crust. What kinds of apple and pear will go well together for an adult palette?
**assistant**:
> An adult palette often enjoys a balance of sweet and tart flavors. Here are some good options for your pie:
> 
> **Apples:**
> 
> - *Granny Smith*: These are tart and crisp, and they hold up well during baking. They're a common choice for pies.
> 
> - *Honeycrisp*: These apples are sweet with a bit of tartness and have a firm texture that withstands baking.
> 
> - *Northern Spy*: This apple is rich, spicy, and slightly tart. It's a great choice if you can find it.
> 
> **Pears:**
> 
> - *Bosc*: These pears have a honey-sweet flavor that intensifies when baked, and they hold their shape well.
> 
> - *Anjou*: These are sweet and slightly tart. They remain firm when baked, but they're juicier than Bosc pears.
> 
> A combination of Granny Smith apples and Bosc pears could work well for a balanced, adult-friendly pie. Both fruits hold up well during baking and provide a good blend of sweetness and tartness.
> 
> As for your pecan crust, both of these fruits pair well with nutty flavors. Remember that flavors can be amplified or balanced out with your choice of spices within your pie. Traditional choices include cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom for a warming, fragrant note that complements both the fruit and the nuttiness of the pecans.

> Enjoy your baking, James!
