> The great cypress tree guarded by a giant you refer to appears in the Greek mythology tale about the hero Orion.
> 
> According to the myth, Orion, a mighty huntsman, fell in love with the seven daughters of Atlas, known as the Pleiades. They didn't reciprocate his feelings, which led to a chase that lasted for seven years. Eventually, the Pleiades were transformed by Zeus into stars to protect them, but Orion didn't give up and was turned into a constellation himself.

> As per the specific part of the myth involving the cypress tree, there appear to be less definitive details around it in traditional Greek mythology. Orion was often depicted with a large club or a lion's pelt, not a tree. However, the connection of Orion with giants and large trees might be part of an interpretation or particular retelling of the myth, rather than a classic version. If you can provide more details or context about the specific story you are referring to, I can search for a more precise answer.
