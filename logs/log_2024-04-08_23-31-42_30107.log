> I find the whole Meno's slave inquiry a bit ridiculous. It's clear that Socrates is teaching the boy, and that the new knowledge comes from the outcomes of logical inquiry, not memory. And with Socrates's love of the dialectic, surely he knows this. Why does he and Meno pretend that recollection is an explanation for it?
**assistant**:
> The Meno's slave scene in Plato's "Meno" is most often interpreted in the context of Plato's theory of recollection, where all learning is essentially remembering things the soul knew in a previous life but had forgotten. The scene features Socrates questioning a servant boy to elicit his inherent knowledge about geometry. This questioning, or Socratic method, is a form of guided discovery where knowledge is ostensibly unearthed, not implanted – hence the claim that the boy recalled the knowledge, rather than being taught it.
> 
> Your view is certainly not uncommon, and critics argue that this scene merely reflects Socrates guiding the boy towards a pre-determined conclusion rather than facilitating the boy's spontaneous remembrance of prior knowledge.
> 
> Why Plato, through Socrates, posits this theory of recollection is an interesting question. As a Platonic plot device, the theory of recollection serves several key philosophical purposes:
> 
> 1. **Innatism:** Plato wanted to establish that some knowledge is innate, not learned. This supports his theory of forms and the idea of a realm of unchanging truths that our mutable, sensible world participates in or imitates.
> 
> 2. **Socratic Irony:** Claiming that he's helping the boy "remember" what he already knew is a manifestation of Socrates' famous claim that he knows only one thing, that is, that he knows nothing. This forces his interlocutor into the driver's seat of their own learning, instead of passively receiving information.
> 
> 3. **Moral Education:** For Plato, virtue cannot be taught, it must be remembered. This is a more organic, self-reliant way of thinking about moral education that emphasizes personal insight and discovery over external teaching.
> 
> 4. **The Role of Inquiry:** Even if the knowledge does come from the outcomes of logical inquiry, as you suggest, this could still support Plato's theory. Logical inquiry may indeed be the mechanism by which the soul recalls its forgotten knowledge.
> 
> While this scene in "Meno" might raise some semantic and pedagogical issues and seem counter-intuitive, it perhaps becomes more coherent in the broader context of Platonic philosophy. However, the interpretation of this scene – and indeed much of Plato's work – is still a subject of ongoing debate among scholars.
**user**:
> So the claim is that mathematical deductions, just like moral virtues, are based on innate realities? I can believe that, but then it's not from past lives but instead from the truth embodied in reality itself.
**assistant**:
> Yes, your interpretation aligns with a different perspective on Plato's theory of recollection. Instead of focusing on past lives, this view emphasizes the idea that knowledge, whether it be in the realm of mathematics or moral virtues, is based on timeless truths or forms that exist independently of human experience. In this framework, the process of recollection could be understood as the soul reconnecting with these eternal realities that underpin the world we perceive.
> 
> Mathematical deductions, in this sense, are not arbitrary constructs or mere products of logical inquiry but rather reflections of the fundamental truths embedded in the fabric of the universe. By engaging in logical reasoning and inquiry, individuals have the opportunity to rediscover and comprehend these universal principles inherent in reality itself.
> 
> This perspective suggests a more ontological foundation for Plato's theory of recollection, emphasizing the objective existence of transcendent forms that serve as the basis for understanding concepts such as mathematics and moral virtues.
> 
> By framing recollection as a process of reconnecting with these eternal truths rather than retrieving past-life memories, this interpretation highlights the inherent order and intelligibility of the universe, as well as the potential for human beings to grasp and embody these truths through reflection, inquiry, and contemplation.
