> Using R's dplyr, how can I pass a variable to group_by? That is, I want to specify the column that the data is grouped by as a string.
**assistant**:
> You can use the `group_by()` function in combination with the `across()` function for such cases. Here's a way to use it with a string variable specifying the column name:
> 
> ```r
> library(dplyr)
> 
> # Example dataframe
> df <- tibble(
>   group_a = c("A", "B", "A", "B"),
>   group_b = c("X", "Y", "X", "Y"),
>   value = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
> )
> 
> # Variable holding the column name as a string
> column_name <- "group_a"
> 
> # Grouping by the specified column
> grouped_df <- df %>%
>   group_by(across(all_of(column_name)))
>   
> # Summarise example
> summary_df <- grouped_df %>%
>   summarise(total_value = sum(value))
> 
> print(summary_df)
> ```

> ### Explanation:
> 1. **tibble:** Creates the example dataframe `df` using `tibble` (from the `dplyr` package).
> 2. **column_name:** Sets the variable `column_name` to hold the name of the column you want to group by.
> 3. **group_by(across(all_of(column_name))):** Uses the `group_by()` function combined with `across(all_of(column_name))` to specify the column to group by dynamically.
> 4. **summarise:** Demonstrates a simple summarisation, calculating the total value for each group.
> 
> This approach allows you to dynamically specify the grouping column based on a variable containing the column name as a string.
