> I am designing a new language, consisting only of the letters N, I, and O. Below I provide some information about the language, and then I have questions.
> 
> The meaning of words is related to the letters or groups of letters that make them up. Generally, the first letter/group of a root provides the general concept, and subsequent letters/groups refine it.
> 
> O denotes the definite, active, and immediate; and can be used for the first person pronoun, nomative case, present tense, indicative verbs, and to denote a noun is singular. As a root, it generally means "do".
> 
> I denotes the observable or dependent; and can be used for the second person pronoun, genitive case, future tense, subjunctive verbs, and to denote a plural mass noun. As a root, it generally means "describe".
> 
> N denotes the unknown or static; and can be used for the third person pronoun, accusative case, past tense, imperative verbs, and to denote a plural count noun. As a root, it generally means "be".
> 
> There are also 9 derived letters.
>  - OO makes B: act
>  - OI makes Q: change
>  - ON makes A: capable
>  - IO makes P: know
>  - II makes U: communicate
>  - IN makes L: opine
>  - NO makes R: make
>  - NI makes J: sense
>  - NN makes M: have
> 
> Nouns are constructed as [root]N<case count>; e.g., JN or JNR means "sensation".
> 
> Verbs are constructed as [root]O<tense conjugation>; e.g., QO or QOR means "changed".
> 
> Adjectives and adverbs are constructed as [root]I<shared ending>; e.g., PI means "known" and JNR PIR means "known sensation".

> What are the most fundamental words that I should define, as a start of a general dictionary?
**assistant**:
> To create a foundation for your language, you should define the most common and essential words that people use to communicate. These fundamental words should cover basic concepts, actions, and objects. Based on the language rules you provided, here's a list of words to get started:

> As your language grows, you can continue to add more vocabulary to your dictionary. Keep in mind that languages often evolve over time, so your dictionary may require updates and revisions as new words are added and existing words take on new meanings.
**user**:
> These examples are closely based on the roots I provided. I am curious about other important roots, which would be constructed by combining the letters/groups above.
**assistant**:
> Sure, let's explore some additional fundamental roots by combining the letters/groups you provided. Here are some examples of potential roots and their meanings:
> 
> 1. BA (learn): Acquire knowledge or skills through study, practice, or experience.
> 2. QU (adapt): Adjust or modify to better suit a new environment or situation.
> 3. AL (grow): Develop or mature, physically or mentally.
> 4. PA (remember): To have in or be able to bring to one's mind an awareness of something from the past.

> 
> Nouns:
> 10. BAN (learning): The acquisition of knowledge or skills.
> 11. QUN (adaptation): The process of adjusting or modifying for a new environment or situation.

> 17. QI (adaptable): Capable of adjusting or modifying to better suit a new environment or situation.
> 18. AI (growing): Developing or maturing, physically or mentally.
> 
> Remember to apply the specific language rules for conjugations, cases, and counts to create a broader range of words. This will allow your language to be more diverse and expressive.
**user**:

**user**:
> Generally, I think that opposites-- like big and small-- should be constructed by first using the word for the relevant dimension (size in this case), followed by O for a more personal extreme, N for a less personal extreme, and I for an intersectionality between the two. Given that, can you provide new options for love, hate, happy, sad, good, bad, big, and small?
**assistant**:
> Sure, using the new rule for constructing opposites, let's create words for love, hate, happy, sad, good, bad, big, and small. 
> 
> First, we need to establish words for the core concepts: emotions, quality, and size. Let's use the following roots:
> 
> 1. Emotions: LJ (Combination of sensation (J) and opine (L))
> 2. Quality: PA (Combination of know (P) and act (A))
> 3. Size: QA (Combination of change (Q) and capable (A))
> 
> Now we can create words for the opposites using your proposed structure:
> 
> 1. Love (Positive Emotion):
>    - Noun: LJO (positive emotion)
>    - Verb: LJOA (to love, to express positive emotions)
>    - Adjective: LJOI (loving, affectionate)
> 
> 2. Hate (Negative Emotion):
>    - Noun: LJN (negative emotion)
>    - Verb: LJNA (to hate, to express negative emotions)

>    - Adjective: QAOI (big, large)
> 
> 8. Small (Lesser Size):
>    - Noun: QAN (lesser size)
>    - Verb: QANA (to shrink, to become small)
