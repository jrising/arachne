**assistant**:
> The error that you're encountering originates from trying to use multi-dimensional indexing on pandas Dataframes or Series. Pandas no longer supports such operations, and now they must be done on a NumPy array.
> 
> In your case, it seems like the dataframe `plotdf2` contains the data you want to plot. But, if `plotdf2.x` and `plotdf2.y` are of complex data types (e.g., series of arrays or nested dataframes), they need to be converted into NumPy arrays before indexing.
> 
> You can convert pandas series or dataframes into NumPy arrays by calling `.values` method on them.
> 
> Here is how to modify your code:
> 
> ```python
> plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
> plt.plot(plotdf2.x.values, plotdf2.y.values)
> ```
> 
> This will convert the dataframe's x and y columns into NumPy arrays and then use them for plotting.
> 
> If this doesn't resolve your issue, then it would help to see the structure of your data and how `plotdf2` is created. You can provide these details by calling `print(plotdf2.head())` and `print(plotdf2.dtypes)` and sharing the output.
