**user**:
> What do the acronyms in this sentence mean: "There will also be data in EA/EIS for wind power by BOEM for Maryland Wind Energy Area."
**assistant**:
> In the sentence you provided, the acronyms stand for the following:
> 
> - EA: Environmental Assessment. This is the process under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in which the potential environmental effects of a proposed federal project are evaluated.
> 
> - EIS: Environmental Impact Statement. This is a more detailed evaluation under NEPA that typically takes place if an EA indicates significant potential impacts.
> 
> - BOEM: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. This is the U.S. federal agency responsible for managing the development of the nation's offshore resources in federal waters.
> 
> - Maryland Wind Energy Area: Designated offshore territory for the development of wind energy. It is an area identified by the BOEM for potential commercial wind energy leasing.
>   
> In the context of your sentence, it means that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will also provide data related to wind power for the Maryland Wind Energy Area in their Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.
