> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Bathymetry” as a data gap. Here is the discussion in Dewberry Engineers 2018:

> Bathymetry is essentially “submarine topography,” or the depths and shapes of underwater terrain. In the same way that topographic maps represent the three-dimensional features (or relief) of overland terrain, bathymetric maps illustrate the land that lies underwater. Bathymetry data are typically collected using acoustic (or sonar) technology; there are several types of sonar systems that may be used to capture the data. Often, additional sensors will be deployed at the same time to collect additional information that can be used to characterize the sediment type, bottom surface, plant cover, subfloor seabed type, and water column properties. In suitable nearshore areas, bathymetry may be collected using a lidar sensor that can capture topobathymetric data. Bathymetry data are typically delivered as a Digital Elevation Model.

> Bathymetry is currently available in piecemeal in the data registry, but it is difficult to find what is needed, the data are not seamless, and not all areas of interest have high-resolution bathymetry. Better tools to find and download the data are needed. Ideally, an updated version of the Coastal Relief Model (CRM) should be published more frequently. The CRM, published by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) integrates offshore bathymetry and land topography into a seamless data model out to the continental slope as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Some areas of the CRM have not been updated since 1998, others are more up to date (2013).
> 					
> High resolution bathymetry out to 60 meters depth is needed for the Great Lakes, all of the Gulf Coast states (even better would be out to the OCS), and out to the OCS on the West Coast. Nearshore bathymetry is also needed for the Pacific Islands.
> 					
> The West Coast seabed data are quite old and only about a third of the shelf has been mapped with high resolution multi-beam bathymetry. Federal funding is often made available for data collection (e.g. by NOAA, BOEM, and others) but is often project based and outside the state waters. California is undertaking an effort to map the seafloor of its state waters; data collection is complete, but the data processing and analysis to derive bottom texture and habitat from the bathymetry are not complete.
> 					
> Nearshore topobathymetric lidar data are needed for American Samoa.
> 					
> Great Lakes bathymetry is also quite old. Some harbors are surveyed frequently, but other areas have not been surveyed recently. There is no high resolution bathymetry for Lake Superior, which has not been surveyed this century. In some areas, to address the lack of adequate bathymetry, local collections have taken place and these data may or may not be shared publicly.

> Bathymetry data are collected and distributed in a patchwork form and are difficult to find and use at scales beyond individual surveys. Additional high resolution/full bottom surveys are needed for complete coverage in priority areas of interest, especially near shore. Seamless ‘best available’ products and more up to date bathymetry data products are needed.

> Identified as a data gap by Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021), bathymetry—the study of the "submarine topography," i.e., underwater terrain—is a crucial aspect of sustainable spatial planning. It underpins several pertinent issues, from offshore activities like renewable energy and aquaculture siting, to community resilience measures and climate adaptation efforts, as well as species and habitat management.
> 
> _*Dewberry Engineers (2018)*_ signaled the current limitations of bathymetry data as piecemeal and challenging to access reliably, with particular issues highlighted such as lack of seamless data, gaps in high-resolution bathymetry, and outdated data in certain areas. They call for enhancements, including better data retrieval tools and more frequent updates of the Coastal Relief Model (CRM), which integrates offshore bathymetry and land topography into a seamless model reaching the continental slope.
> 
> They also emphasized the need for high resolution bathymetry for a variety of geographic locations, including the Gulf Coast states, Great Lakes, Pacific Islands, and West Coast. While these locations may not directly apply to Delaware's geography, the overarching need for updated bathymetry data remains relevant. Indeed, they mention that some areas of the CRM have not been updated since 1998 which could similarly apply to Delaware's ocean and bay areas.
> 
> Finally, _*Dewberry Engineers*_'s report highlights the importance of interpreting bathymetry into bottom habitat information. Understanding the features of various habitats and regions of ecological significance can offer valuable insights to manage fisheries, habitats, and invasive species more effectively.
> 
> According to the _*Trice et al. (2021)*_, bathymetry data suffers from its patchwork nature, encompassing disjointed individual surveys. They underscore the necessity for additional full bottom surveys and seamless 'best available' products to ensure comprehensive coverage, especially in nearshore areas—areas that could be particularly relevant to Delaware given its extensive coastline.
> 
> While the aforementioned gaps and needs may not have been specifically associated with Delaware in these reports, the need for high-resolution, up-to-date, and easily accessible bathymetry data seems universal. For Delaware's planning process, addressing these deficiencies could aid in reconciling a variety of issues, from offshore wind development and aquaculture operations to climate adaptation and species habitat protection.
