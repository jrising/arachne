> Introduction and Background
> The physical impacts of climate change are increasing at an alarming rate and have become macro-
> critical issues, with the budgetary impacts and fiscal pressures from extreme events growing in many
> countries and significantly affecting the responsibilities of economic decision-makers worldwide. Yet
> whilst there has been an increase in investment in adaptation, it remains severely underfunded
> across all countries, with inadequate engagement from Finance Ministers, key economic decision-
> makers, and Heads of State. 1
> To respond to this need, the Gates Foundation is preparing a range of products to inform the
> adaptation discussions in the run up to COP30 in Belém, Brazil. The overall intention is to build a
> package of products that can reference each other and jointly create a compelling case for
> adaptation for COP30. This might be complemented by a communications and engagement effort
> led by senior economic decision-makers and thought leaders.
> Work already underway includes a study by WRI to assess the returns to specific adaptation
> investments using the ‘triple dividend’ framework. This will inform complementary work assembling
> a collection of “best buys for adaptation” in key sectors and matching this to how to finance them.
> The Gates Foundation have asked GRI to consider a contribution to this series of products with a
> focus on highlighting the latest evidence on the macroeconomic costs of inaction on mitigation and
> adaptation and summarizing the macroeconomic arguments for investing in adaptation for
> economic and other decisionmakers.
> GRI proposes to undertake a global review and analytical synthesis of the costs, benefits, and
> potential of investing in adaptation at the macro-economic and macro-fiscal level and
> complementing this with a set of case studies of countries that have and have not invested in
> resilience, their success factors and financing instruments involved. Both mitigation and major
> adaptation investments are urgently needed as the longer we wait the more costly it will get, and
> the less effective adaptation will be. As a rule of thumb, the costs of adaptation increase with
> warming, and there are thresholds beyond which some adaptation options are no longer viable.
> Adaptation is likely to be more effective at reducing losses in a 2°C scenario than in a 3°C scenario. 2
> Whilst resilient development is a necessary condition for reducing climate risk, it is wholly
> insufficient unless complemented by targeted adaptation investments (see World Bank, 2024).

> 1 The UNEP Adaptation Gap Report 2024 estimates that while international public adaptation finance flows to developing

> estimated US$187-359 billion per year (https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024).

> Proposed study
> Fortunately, there is growing evidence in this area, although assessments differ widely in their
> underlying assumptions, modelling approach and context. A coherent understanding among policy
> makers would benefit from assembling and synthesising the existing studies on costs of inaction as
> well as on the wider benefits of taking action in a compelling way. This includes recent analyses
> which underscore the substantial macroeconomic costs associated with inaction on climate change. 3
> For example, a report by the Climate Policy Initiative estimates that the global cost of inaction could
> reach USD 1,266 trillion, considering various warming scenarios and timeframes (Alberti, 2024). 4
> All countries are already experiencing impacts of slow onset change and experiencing greater
> extreme weather event. Assessing the experienced damages from climate change already occurring
> is a key starting point and can help communicate to MoFs the macroeconomic and fiscal costs
> already being experienced, as well as analogues from other countries to provide real-world
> examples. This also allows MoFs to understand the transmission mechanisms through which climate
> is likely to affect drivers of growth and spending pressures, and align them to existing national
> economic modelling frameworks.
> Moving to the adaptation side, what is often unclear is the role of adaptation in dealing with these
> climate damages, but also how to frame adaptation and conduct relevant analysis to inform macro-
> economic and fiscal policy and investment.
> Adaptation has economic benefits because it reduces the risks of climate change, but it has costs
> associated with planning and implementation. Assessing these costs and benefits is key to building
> the case for adaptation, and for assessing alternatives, but this analysis is extremely challenging. 5
> This is because adaptation is a response to site and context-specific risks (determined by hazard,
> vulnerability and exposure) that change dynamically over time and involve very high uncertainty,
> which in turn affect the level of adaptation needed and the level and timing of its benefits.
> Adaptation is therefore increasingly recognized as a process that requires capacity-building, planning
> and delivery of multiple types of activities (often in portfolios), rather than a set of one-off decisions.
> While uncertainty is not a reason for inaction, it requires a different mindset, i.e., to make decisions
> under uncertainty, and has led to a growing focus on using adaptive management and adaptation
> pathways (see IPCC, 2022 6 ).
> Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that adaptation can deliver net-positive economic (societal)
> benefits. This comes from two complementary areas. First, impact assessments of future climate
> change identify that adaptation is net-beneficial, with positive net present values or benefit-to-cost
> ratios (BCRs) e.g. as identified in modelling studies on coastal protection (Hinkel et al. 2018 7 ).
> 
> 3 Note that important part of the proposed study will be to consider the conflicting results that are generated from
> different cost of inaction studies, as these act as a barrier to action by Ministries of Finance. For example, depending on the
> global modelling study taken, the range of possible costs of inaction vary from modest to catastrophic, and for some
> sectors or countries, some studies even project positive results. The analysis will assess these differences, and also
> compare global estimates to more national based studies, as part of a ground truthing exercise. This information can then
> be used to provide more informed guidance to MoFs on the use of data.

> We are just starting, and have been asked by a partner to more clearly define the measures of macroeconomic and macro-fiscal climate impacts we will study.  What should we consider, to be well-grounded in the available evidence?
**assistant**:
> This sounds like a comprehensive and important project, James! To define the measures of macroeconomic and macro-fiscal climate impacts you're going to study, you might consider a range of indicators across different dimensions of economic and fiscal policy:
> 
> 1. **Direct Economic Impacts:**
>    - **GDP Loss:** Look at reductions in GDP due to climate-induced changes in productivity, labor supply, and output losses across sectors.
>    - **Sectoral Output:** Examine the differential impacts on various sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and manufacturing.
> 
> 2. **Fiscal Impacts:**
>    - **Public Expenditure:** Focus on increased expenditures related to disaster relief, infrastructure repair, and health impacts resulting from climate events.
>    - **Revenue Impacts:** Evaluate potential losses in tax revenue from impacted sectors, reduced labor productivity, or shifts in trade balances.
> 
> 3. **Investment Needs:**
>    - **Adaptation Costs:** Assess the costs associated with implementing necessary adaptation measures, and how these costs compare to potential avoided damages.
>    - **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Use tools like Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCRs) to evaluate the return on investment for different adaptation strategies.
> 
> 4. **Growth and Productivity:**
>    - **Long-Term Growth Projections:** Model how climate impacts could alter growth trajectories, considering both direct impacts and secondary effects through changes in investment and innovation.
>    - **Productivity Shifts:** Measure changes in productivity due to extreme weather events, changes in crop yields, and shifts in labor availability.
> 
> 5. **Fiscal Sustainability and Stability:**
>    - **Debt and Deficit Changes:** Explore changes in national debt and fiscal deficits as governments adapt or respond to climate impacts.
>    - **Risk of Fiscal Crises:** Assess how climate impacts could heighten the risk of fiscal crises or exacerbate existing vulnerabilities in countries' fiscal positions.
> 
> 6. **Insurance and Financial Instruments:**
>    - **Risk Transfer Mechanisms:** Include analyses of how governments use insurance and financial markets to manage climate risks, and the fiscal implications of these strategies.
>    - **Role of Public and Private Financing Instruments:** Evaluate the viability and effectiveness of different financing instruments in climate resilience building.
> 
> 7. **Transmission Mechanisms:**
>    - **Economic Linkages:** Study how climate impacts are transmitted through trade, supply chains, and global financial markets, affecting national economies.
>    - **Cross-Border Impacts:** Consider the implications of international climate impacts—such as migration or food security—on national economies.
> 
> Your methodology could use models that simulate these indicators under various climate and adaptation scenarios, while critically analyzing case studies to contextualize these measures in real-world experiences. Collaborating with economists and leveraging existing data from initiatives like those by the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action would provide grounding and credibility. 
> 
> Lastly, ensure you're aligning your measures with the most recent empirical literature and frameworks, such as the IPCC reports and UNEP assessments, to ground your work in robust evidence.

> Can you explain to me how Debt and Deficit Changes and Risk of Fiscal Crises emerge, other than just through an imbalance of tax revenue and government expenditures?
> 
> Also, should I be looking at other macroeconomic variables? I know there are results on labor productivity and on capital loss, but I don't know if those would be considered macroeconomic in this sense. Similarly, I know macroeconomists look at unemployment and such-- should I include anything like that?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Understanding how debt and deficit changes, as well as the risk of fiscal crises, can emerge involves exploring various channels beyond the straightforward imbalance between tax revenue and government expenditures. Here are some key points to consider:
> 
> ### Factors Beyond Revenue and Expenditure Imbalance
> 
> 1. **Economic Growth Rate:**
>    - A slowing growth rate can lead to lower tax revenues (due to reduced incomes and profits) while expenditures for social safety nets may increase, contributing to a rising deficit and mounting debt.
>   
> 2. **Interest Rates:**
>    - Increased interest rates raise the cost of borrowing, which can exacerbate deficits if governments have to pay more on existing debt. This can create a feedback loop where rising debt leads to even higher interest rates.
>   
> 3. **Inflation:**
>    - High inflation can erode the real value of debt temporarily, but it may also lead to increased nominal government spending (e.g., indexing social benefits), which can worsen fiscal positions unless inflation leads to proportional revenue growth.
> 
> 4. **Changes in Economic Structure:**
>    - Structural changes in the economy (e.g., declines in key sectors) may result in falling revenues and increased costs for assistance or retraining programs, worsening fiscal balances.
> 
> 5. **External Shocks:**
>    - Natural disasters or geopolitical events can create immediate expenses for recovery efforts, straining budgets and leading to increased borrowing.
> 
> 6. **Contingent Liabilities:**
>    - Governments often face liabilities related to pensions, social security, and health care which can grow unexpectedly due to demographic changes or economic downturns, increasing fiscal pressures irrespective of current expenditure and revenue levels.
> 
> 7. **Monetary Policy Interactions:**
>    - Central bank policies (like quantitative easing) may allow for temporary fiscal easing, but reliance on such measures can distort responsibilities and lead to instability in long-term interest rates.
> 
> ### Additional Macroeconomic Variables to Consider
> 
> Absolutely, broader macroeconomic variables can provide vital context for understanding fiscal dynamics:
> 
> 1. **Labor Productivity:**
>    - Productivity levels dictate economic growth potential. Higher productivity can enhance revenue without increasing tax rates while reducing pressure on social programs.
> 
> 2. **Capital Depreciation/Loss:**
>    - As capital goods lose value or become obsolete, this can reduce overall economic output and the tax base, contributing to fiscal pressures.
> 
> 3. **Unemployment:**
>    - Higher unemployment increases government spending on social safety nets while reducing tax revenues, creating a direct impact on deficits.
> 
> 4. **Public Investment:**
>    - Analysis of public investment levels can reveal how governments are preparing for future growth, as inadequate investment can lead to spiraling costs down the line.
> 
> 5. **Trade Balance:**
>    - Persistent trade deficits may weaken currency value, leading to more expensive imports and inflation, which can affect fiscal health.
> 
> 6. **Economic Cycles:**
>    - Debt and deficit issues often correlate with business cycles. During downturns, fiscal deficits tend to widen due to falling revenues and increased spending, leading to potential fiscal crises during bust periods.
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> In summary, it’s crucial to adopt a holistic view of fiscal health by considering a range of macroeconomic variables and interactions. This will allow for a more nuanced understanding of how fiscal dynamics evolve over time and why certain economies may become more vulnerable to crises. Incorporating labor productivity, unemployment, capital loss, and other macroeconomic indicators will enrich your analysis and provide a broader context for understanding fiscal challenges.
