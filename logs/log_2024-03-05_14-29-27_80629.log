> How can I get full, absolute urls from a page that I am parsing in BeautifulSoup?
**assistant**:
> The Python package Beautiful Soup is a powerful tool for web scraping. For extracting full, absolute URLs from parsed HTML, it's important to note that the `href` attribute in an `a` tag can hold either a relative or full URL. To ensure you always get the absolute URL, you can make use of the `urljoin` method from Python's `urllib.parse` module.
> 
> Below is an example of how to use Beautiful Soup to parse a webpage and collect the full, absolute URLs:
> 
> ```python
> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
> import requests
> from urllib.parse import urljoin
> 
> # Load web page
> url = "https://example.com"
> response = requests.get(url)
> 
> # Parse the page with BeautifulSoup
> soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
> 
> # Iterate over every link with an href attribute
> for link in soup.find_all('a'):
>     href = link.get('href')
>     if href:
>         # Create the absolute URL
>         full_url = urljoin(url, href)
>         print(full_url)
> ```
> 
> Here, `urljoin` combines a base URL (the webpage you're parsing) with the relative URL found in the `href` attribute to create a full, absolute URL.
