> Introduction
>  For centuries, biologists and economists have been challenged with figuring out the most efficient and effective way to regulate fishing pressures on certain fish populations without hurting the fishermen’s success. In addition to getting agreement among all parties, there is the challenge of being flexible and effective when handling the constantly changing factors within the fishery system. Fisheries are difficult to manage due to fish migration/immigration, seasonal changes, competition among fishermen, and many more moving factors. Two common regulatory methods are caps on total allowable catch (TAC) and individual transferable quotas (ITQs). TACs limit the catch that the entire fishery may harvest. ITQs, on the other hand, assign rights to portions of a TAC to individual fishers, with the ability to trade, buy, and sell quotas amongst each other to generate more revenue. These two methods vary in success and are each subject to their controversies. Successfully regulating a fish population so the species does not go extinct and the fishermen can make a living remains a complex problem.
> Fisheries are a critical part of a healthy economy and ecosystem. Fisheries help employ over 40 million people globally (Teh & Sumaila, 2011). Jobs range from working in fishing fleets to being in factories to process the fish so it can be sold. There are thousands of employees in factories around the world processing fish for use in other products, so the scope of fishery jobs is very broad. If a fishery were to collapse, then tens of thousands of people would become unemployed. A collapse not only impacts the economy but also harms consumers. Many fish brought to the market are a primary source of protein for the majority of the world. Salmon, for example, is one of the most common fish species found in many everyday diets (Sargent, 1997). Losing a species could cause significant shifts in consumer behaviors, as their primary source of protein has disappeared. Fisheries are also economically beneficial as they bring in revenue from coastal tourism and provide income for many communities (Otrachshenko & Bosello, 2016). Along with their economic benefits, fish play a critical role in marine ecosystems. If one species were to become extinct, an entire food web could collapse, causing imbalances in other aquatic populations (Jackson et al., 2001). Maintaining fisheries at a healthy level for all is crucial to keeping a vital source of food, income, ecosystem, and industry. 
> Global fisheries have experienced periods of varying severity of overfishing at some point over the past few centuries. Overfishing causes a targeted species’ population to decline, which impacts an ecosystem’s structure. It can shift predator-prey food webs, causing a trophic cascade effect. It can also lead to bycatch and habitat destruction, which impacts non-targeted species (Kappel, 2005). Some fisheries have been more fortunate because their targeted fish population was able to make a full recovery after being overfished. However, many of the fisheries that experienced overfishing met their demise when the regulations put into place, if any, were unsuccessful. Fishing regulations have been tricky because multiple parties are involved. The fishermen see a pool of promise to raise their income, where they want to outcompete the other fishers first and catch as much fish as possible to earn the most profit. The biologists are primarily concerned with the fish species depleting faster than they can grow and reproduce, which could lead to species extinction and a cascade effect of various ecological issues. Alternatively, economists are worried about the fish market’s success, ensuring the fishery brings in revenue, and maintaining fishermen’s job security. Trying to satisfy the goals of fishermen, biologists, and economists is the root cause of the issues that arise in fisheries management. Their goals don’t align, and they lack communication and cohesiveness, preventing regulations from being effective. This is just one aspect of the dynamic system that is fisheries management.
> One of the largest fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean is the Icelandic Atlantic Cod (IAC) fishery, which has catch reports dating back to the 1500s. The IAC population faced many periods of overfishing and recovery, but fishing pressures drastically increased around 1950. After World War II ended, there were numerous subsequent wars over who owned the rights to fish throughout the northern Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and its surrounding countries. The Icelandic Ministry of Fisheries (IMF) initially thought if it extended its area of control to 200 nautical miles off its coast, it could better manage its Atlantic cod population and keep it from declining further. Despite pushing out foreign ships, the IMF still faced a plummet in IAC population size. So, they implemented quotas and landing fees, attempting to allow the cod population to replenish itself. However, these management efforts were difficult to enforce, and Iceland spent several decades altering and honing its fishing regulations.
> The IAC seems to have finally stabilized under a nearly universal ITQ system implemented in 1990. However, ITQs have faced substantial debate due to their potential for distributional inequalities. With larger fisheries such as the IAC, it is common for smaller ships to be “bought out” by the larger vessels. If the larger vessels are able, they will use their profits to buy the rights to keep fishing even further. These buyouts can substantially impact small fishing communities and create high barriers to entry for new fishers. To that end, Iceland’s ITQ system has faced numerous changes over the years while attempting to protect smaller fishers. Our research investigates one such compromise, which was ultimately scrapped as ineffective to gain further insight into this common management technique.
> Research Question
> Over the past century, the IAC population experienced several periods of rapid decline followed by recovery. However, by 1983, the population had drastically decreased again. As a result, we want to test the impacts of additional management methods on the success of the IAC population growing back to a sustainable level. In 1984, Iceland implemented an incomplete ITQ system. Small vessels could opt to fish under an effort-based system instead, in which their days at sea were regulated. But, they could fish 20% beyond what their quota would have allowed under the ITQs. Over the next six years, the fishing fleet exploded by nearly 1,000 more small vessels, and the portion of catch by the small vessel fleet jumped from 3% to 14% (Gretarsson, 2010). Cod continued to sharply decline, and in 1990, the effort-based system was eliminated. Nearly all ships were required to operate within the ITQ system, and the cod began to recover.
> The effort-based option seemed a harmless compromise that preserved the autonomy of the small boat fleet, yet it was considered a primary factor in the fleet’s collapse. It is possible that the blame for Iceland’s continued decline in cod after 1984 has been misplaced, and an effort-based quota system could offer relief to small fishers in other contexts. We thus study the question of whether the effort-based complement to Iceland’s ITQ system was a critical driver of cod’s decline and whether it would have continued to reinforce this downward trend.
> In order to answer this question, we will build an agent-based model of a fishery in which we can vary the proportion of small vessels which fish under the broader ITQ system or under their own effort-based quota. Recognizing the complexity involved in simulating the economics  system of quota trading, we will create a fish stock and quota market which are relatively predictable and static in their behavior. Instead, the main variables in the model will involve the effort-based component which serves as the crux of our research question. This model will be calibrated to the conditions of the 1984 fishery as much as possible, with modern data used as a proxy for missing historical values. 
> Model 
> To answer this question, we built an agent-based model representing a single stock fished by individual ships (Figure 1). This model simplifies the state of the Atlantic cod fishery at the time ITQs were introduced. The fish consist of a single mass that changes via logistic growth, defined by a growth rate and carrying capacity. The stock was set at an initial size of 1,000 (in thousands of metric tons) to roughly match the size of the stock in the study period (OECD, 2017). The fishery is capped by a TAC of 238,000 metric tons, the TAC set in  1990 (Pálsson & Helgason, 1995). 
> Because data on the fishing fleet is only available by tonnage rather than several vessels (Eythórsson, 2000), the fishing fleet is approximated by the fleet’s status today. Our population of boats began at just 600; in reality, the population of vessels was more than 1,700 in 1984 (Gretarsson, 2010). Within our model’s population, we generated proportional numbers of vessels for each of four categories defined by Statistics Iceland: boats of 0-10 gross tonnage, 10-200 GT, greater than 200 GT (capped at 1,000), and trawlers (assumed 1,000-1,500 GT). Triangular distributions were used for each category, peaking at the mean tonnage (Statistics Iceland, 2022). We similarly calculated operating costs and revenues per ship to define annual cost and price curves. Catchability, beginning profits balance, and beginning tradable quota were all scaled by the size of the ship under the assumption that larger ships would possess more resources.
> Two key behaviors of the ships were implemented. First, small ships (defined as 0-10 GT) could fish either as part of the quota system (only up to their share of the TAC) or under an effort-based quota. Under the effort-based quota, the modeled small ships would fish only for a reduced period (278 days in the model’s default scenario) but up to 20% over what their quota would have been (Gretarsson, 2010). Small boats were randomly assigned to either the effort quota or ITQ systems by the model at a base rate of 75%. Ships assigned to either fishing scheme remain in that fishing scheme throughout the simulation; in reality, eligible ships could choose which scheme to pursue at any given point, resulting in the majority of small ships pursuing an effort-based quota until the elimination of that system (which we justify via our high starting rate of small ships in the effort-based system). The second behavior added to the model is a simplistic mechanism for quota transfers. Each year, ships assess the other ships fishing in the area around them on the ITQ system. Their quota then changes based on how their profits differ from the average profits of the ships around them. If they have lower-than-average profits, they will give up their quota, transferring it to ships with higher-than-average profits. If a ship’s quota (or the fish stock) drops to 0, the ship is bought out and removed from the fleet.
> The model generally behaves along one of two paths depending on the initial random proportions of ship weights. First, the model may immediately begin a rapid growth until it reaches its carrying capacity, where it’s fished freely at its TAC. Second, the model may decline and eventually collapse. Depending on the values of other variables (as shown in our experiments), this collapse may be rapid and immediate or could follow a decade or two of relatively steady fishing and biomass. There do not appear to be any common scenarios in which the fish stock reaches any equilibrium other than reaching its carrying capacity or collapsing entirely. This lack of stability is due to the static nature of our model. While fishers’ catch is dependent on biomass, the TAC is constant. The fishers can be bought out of the fishery, but it would simply transfer their quota (and essentially their total catch) to other fishers; the actual cumulative fishing effort does not cease completely without the fish stock collapsing. On the fishers’ end, our modeled ships collectively seldom fish out the full TAC due to the reduced stock size (though individual ships may fish their fully assigned portion depending on size) apart from scenarios of rapid stock growth. This behavior is not unprecedented but, in reality, ships could fish until they had used up their total portion of the TAC based on their quota ownership. This would be dependent on the fish population and catchability. 
> The quota mechanism also results in a steady decline of the smallest ships over time. Our model is constructed such that quota is automatically transferred based on differentials in profits, and it also assigns an initial value of profits equal to ship size. Therefore, no other scenario likely exists except for small ships generally transferring their quota to larger ones over time. For this reason, our model is not designed to study how ITQs change the balance between large ships and small ships, as such a study would require a highly accurate and sensitive model. Instead, our model assumes the condition that ITQs cause a decline in small ships. The model is suited to investigating the power of the group outside of the ITQ system (the effort-based fishers) to influence the health of the fishery, even if the relative rates of decline in the ITQ-based small ships (due to growing or shrinking differences in profits) may change throughout the simulations.
> Results
> 	Since the model is agent-based, results differ each time it is run based on the initial distributions of fleet ship sizes and the number of small ships that opt for the effort-based quota. Therefore, each experiment was performed in 20 trials, and the results were averaged. Our first experiment was designed to address the core of our research question: were the effort-based ships truly responsible for the stock’s continued collapse from 1984-1990, or did another underlying problem with the ITQs or the TAC cause the problem? To answer this question, we ran the model under two conditions. For a control, we first ran it with the effort ratio set to 0; in this scenario, the entire fleet participated in the ITQ system (applied after 1990). Second, we ran our model with the effort ratio set to 0.75, representing roughly 75% of small ships choosing to fish under an effort quota. We then compared the health of the stock in two ways. First, since the ITQ still often resulted in our model collapsing, we compared the raw number of trials in which the stock collapsed versus undergoing rapid growth. The model was allowed to run for 50 years (from 1984 to 2033), and the point of collapse was measured upon the fish stock reaching 0. However, it should be noted that in cases of collapse, the stock was collapsing beyond recovery long before the stock completely disappeared (sometimes for a decade or more). In the cases of collapse, the second variable for comparison was the average number of years it took for the stock to collapse.

> 	In the control case, the fish stock almost always exploded in growth and stabilized at carrying capacity (Table 1; Figure 2A). The fishing fleet steadily consolidated, with larger ships buying up quota, and the fleet fished at the constant TAC. In 15% of control trials, the stock collapsed, but only after several decades. When the effort-based fishers were added in at a 75% rate, the stock collapsed in every trial. While it took an average of 17.7 years for the fish to disappear entirely, the experimental case showed an immediate, sharp drop in stock from the first year (Figure 3). Notably, this sharp drop very closely mirrored the decline in cod from 1984-1990 that was measured in reality during the time in which the effort-based quota system was active. In the primary experiment, there is thus a marked difference in the stock’s ability to recover depending on the existence of the effort-based system. The evidence indicates that the answer to this study’s research question is that the allowance of ships to pursue an effort-based quota was the reason that Iceland’s initial ITQ system did not immediately improve stock health. While the pure ITQ system was imperfect, the stock successfully recovered in 85% of trials without the effort-based system in this simulation.

> 	We also ran several sensitivity tests on this result to verify the extent to which it holds. We selected a proportion of 75% of small ships pursuing effort-based quotas because of the popularity of this system for its greater catch; however, some critical numbers may exist such that a population of ships could depend on the effort-based quota without the stock collapsing. Thus, we ran the experiment again with the effort ratio set at 25% and 50% to test how the effect of the effort-based group on the stock changes with relative size. As the proportion of effort-based users shrank, the degree of collapse also was reduced in a non-linear fashion. In the 25% and 50% sensitivity runs, the stock collapsed 80% and 95% of the time respectively. However, despite the high rate of collapse in the 25% run, it took an average of 30.2 years for the stock to disappear completely. These tests indicate that even moderate cohorts of effort-based fishers can slowly chip away at the stock’s health, and such a system would have to be limited to an extremely small group to retain a high likelihood of recovery.
> 	Given this model’s immense simplification of the quota-trading and effort-based systems, we also wanted to verify that a misestimation of the mechanics of these systems could not alter the degree of effect. In the default model, quota was traded at a rate equal to the profit differential multiplied by 0.001; the multiplier was adjusted to 0.0001 and 0.01. Because our model does not change the net quota available to ships, we would not expect changes in this value to substantially alter the fish stock, instead only affecting the balance of varying ship sizes. 
> In both cases, the stock collapsed in every trial (as in the base case). However, compared to the base case’s average collapse time of 17.7 years, reducing the multiplier to 0.0001 (slowing trading) increased the average time to 18.7 years, and increasing the multiplier to 0.01 (increasing trading) decreased the average time to 15.05 years. Student-t tests were conducted to compare these averages to the base case, with borderline significance (P=0.098) and strong significance (P=0.000), respectively. It is possible that many ships are not able to fish at their full potential given the current state of the stock, but larger, more profitable ships can do so more efficiently in the model. However, this result may be an aberration of the model itself, as ships would have little incentive to buy quota given the large portion of TAC not being utilized. This result indicates that the trading mechanism of the model should be adjusted in future studies to create more precise trading behavior.
> For the effort-based system, we also tested our model with the effort-based fishers fishing for 180 days and 365 days (instead of the base 278). In a 365-day scenario, the effort-based fishers would fish at the same rate as the quota fishers but would never be able to be bought out. The 180-day scenario tests a more restrictive effort-based system. Again, both sensitivity runs collapsed in every trial, with the 180-day and 365-day run having average collapse times of 17.8 years (P=0.810) and 18.8 years (P=0.093). These results do not differ greatly from the base scenario, an unexpected result that indicates that the level of effort does not change the rate of collapse. Several possibilities might explain this result. First, the potency of the effort quota in causing the stock to collapse may simply be that these fishers can fish 20% more quota than they would in the ITQ system (Gretarsson, 2010). While the overall TAC is not met, if smaller ships are normally able to meet their full quota (while perhaps larger ships fail to), then the additional coverage could be sufficient to cause a collapse.
> A much more troubling explanation concerns a core limitation of the model. Unless they are bought out of the ITQ system, the fishers do not stop fully fishing. Thus, even after the stock completely collapses, the full effort-based sector remains intact and fishing (albeit at a reduced catch due to the reduced stock) when they, in reality, might be forced out of the fishery (Figure 3). Even in the ITQ-based system, the slow reduction in ships does not see any increased drop during a collapsing stock, with ships only exiting en masse upon the stock’s total disappearance (Figure 3). Thus, the stocks simulated in this model are experiencing greater pressures during their most vulnerable periods, potentially compromising our ability to accurately assess their health.
> 	Our model is subject to several other severe limitations that should be considered. One of the principal limitations is the uncertainty in the mechanics of the fish stock itself (such as its growth rate, growth equation, and carrying capacity). During the study period, it was believed the fish stock had a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 400,000 tons, and the TAC was set to 238,000 tons (Arnason, 1993). With a 1984 estimated stock of 950,000 tons of cod (OECD, 2017), this TAC thus represents fishing out roughly a quarter of the existing stock. At a growth rate of 0.1, the stock couldn't avoid collapse if fished at the TAC. With a carrying capacity of 5,000-10,000 thousand metric tons, growth rates of 0.3 or more would be required for the stock to recover. These extremely high growth rates can indicate that a logistic growth model may not be appropriate for this stock, or stock assessors may not genuinely have expected the full TAC to be caught for this stock to recover given its depleted state. 
> 	Furthermore, the quota system works by transferring profits from smaller ships to larger, more profitable ships nearby. The inability of our model to simulate the actual changes in the fleet due to supply and demand may affect how it changes and thus change the stock. However, just as we do not remove ships from the model due to shrinking stocks, an important aspect of our model is that we also do not add ships. As noted, the years in which the effort-based quota was active saw a boom of nearly 1,000 additional small ships (Gretarsson, 2010). In this sense, our model provides a somewhat conservative assessment of the effects of the effort-based system and could demonstrate a diluted effect that would only grow in the true system.
> Conclusion and Discussion
> When Iceland first created its ITQ system, allowing small fishers to continue to fish on an effort-based system seemed like a sufficient compromise to preserve both the cod and small fishing operations. However, this study reaffirms Iceland’s later decision that the additional catch created by such a fishery can prevent a stock from recovering. This simulation’s conclusions support that ITQs are only fully effective if the entire fishery operates within the TAC. 
> The results suggest that fisheries managers seeking to create more equitable quota systems should pursue other avenues besides allowing a subsector of the fishery to continue fishing beyond the desired cap. For example, Iceland eventually implemented rules preventing any one owner from possessing more than a maximum proportion of the total quota. A later system allowed Iceland’s smallest fishers to fish under their hard catch limits. The specific scenario studied here may also be considered a cautionary tale on the problem of enforcement. Fisheries can be difficult to monitor, and some fishers may illegally fish beyond their assigned limits (much as our effort-fishers did legally). Fisheries that experience pervasive issues with compliance would function analogously to our system and could thus fall into disarray.
> However, our results are based on a substantially simplified version of the fishery. We studied a static, uniform fishery under high uncertainty. Most critically, our simulated fishery lacked the economic motivations of the real world. Fishers neither exited nor entered the fishery, and quotes were traded in a formulaic manner. While the feedback of the fishery reasonably approximates the fishery as it existed in 1984 (Figure 3), these differences may fail to capture tipping points that would greatly alter the trajectory of this model. As other fisheries consider modified ITQ systems, this research may thus be considered enlightening but far from definitive. Future studies should more rigorously model the economic conditions of the system and consider how the influx or outflux of fishers may change a system’s paradigm, and stocks should be modeled according to more timely stock assessments and more precise science.

> The sustainable management of fisheries is paramount in preserving fish populations, supporting the livelihood of fishermen, and maintaining the balance within marine ecosystems. This study focuses on the role of individual tradable quotas (ITQs) in conserving Iceland’s Atlantic cod (IAC), specifically investigating the impact on the IAC population when small vessels operate under alternative management methods. Utilizing an agent-based model calibrated with historical and modern data, the research simulates a fishery under a dual system combining ITQs and an effort-based quota, which small vessels could opt into, allowing them to catch beyond their ITQ allocation. Results clearly demonstrated that the inclusion of effort-based quotas significantly contributed to the decline of the IAC stock from 1984-1990, with a complete collapse occurring in every trial when 75% of small ships chose the effort-based quota. Sensitivity tests suggested that even a minor presence of effort-fishers could hinder stock recovery. The study emphasizes the necessity for comprehensive adherence to ITQ systems for the successful regeneration of fish populations and questions the efficacy of providing concessions that allow overfishing.
