**user**:
> In an example of dimensional analysis, I see more than one unitless product formed, and then these are related proportionally. Do you need more than one, or can you just say that a unitless product equals a constant?
**assistant**:
> In dimensional analysis, the goal is to establish relationships between physical quantities by analyzing their dimensions. While it is possible to have multiple unitless products in an equation, it's not necessary to have more than one to establish proportional relationships.
> 
> In dimensional analysis, a unitless product represents a dimensionless quantity, often referred to as a dimensionless constant or a pure number. This dimensionless constant captures the proportional relationship between two or more quantities.
> 
> For example, let's consider the equation:
> 
> A = k * B * C,
> 
> where A, B, and C are physical quantities with their respective units, and k is the dimensionless constant. In this case, the product B * C is dimensionless because it does not have any units. The dimensionless constant k represents the proportionality between A and the product B * C. It establishes the numerical relationship between the quantities without any dependence on the specific units.
> 
> Therefore, you can indeed express a proportional relationship using a single dimensionless product and a dimensionless constant.
