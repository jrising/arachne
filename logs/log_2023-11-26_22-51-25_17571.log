>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

> My name is Matheus Fronza and I am contacting you in regard to the PhD program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. I am a recent graduate of Temple University with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Latin American Studies. I am planning to apply for a graduate student position to begin in the Fall 2024 semester. While doing research on environmental economics, I read some of your research (and the website "Practical Guide to Climate Econometrics"), and I believe our interests overlap well. I am interested in climate econometrics and modeling socio-environmental systems. My senior thesis at Temple was a basic econometric model that sought to understand what socioeconomic factors drove up photo voltaic capacity in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of hurricanes Irma, Maria and Fiona. My goal is to further develop my mathematical, environmental and economical knowledge and apply it to model and analyze policy in Latin America and the Caribbean.

> In the previous month, I attended an open house event for the Environmental Economics program hosted by Dr. Kimberly Oremus, and she mentioned she wasn’t sure if you’re planning on taking any new graduate students for next academic year. The purpose of this email is to introduce myself and also ask if you are planning to take in any new students.

> I was inspired by what I read in two articles that you co-authored, “The Missing Risks of Climate Change” and “Climate damage projections beyond annual temperature”. I concur that quality environmental/economic research requires interdisciplinary collaboration, and that many risks and factors are crucially ignored or underrepresented. While researching about Puerto Rico's electricity crisis I had that sentiment as well. Especially when including those often-neglected factors such as precipitation, temperature extremes and variability exacerbate the disparities between the Global South and the Global North. In my experience as an economics undergraduate at Temple, I felt that environmental concerns were largely ignored or compartmentalized as “externalities”, however I believe that they should be in the forefront of policy and economic analysis, as humanity's response to the climate crisis will be the defining struggle of the 21st century.

> I hope you enjoy your holiday break and the last few weeks of the academic semester. I also contacted two other faculty members at the University of Delaware whose research interests are similar to mine (Dr. Franscisco Costa and Dr. Martin Heintzelman). I am quite impressed with the Enviromental Economics graduate program at the School of Marine Science and Policy and its interdisciplinary approach. I hope to be able meet you in the future.

**assistant**:
> Dear Matheus Fronza,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and your interest in the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. It appears based on your research interests and past work that you would be a good candidate for this program.
> 
> Given your focus on climate econometrics and modeling socio-environmental systems, aligning with my research, particularly to implement this in the Latin America and Caribbean context, makes it seem like a potential good match.
> 
> However, please note that funding is limited in our Ph.D. program. Having your application in by the end of the calendar year would put you in the running for any available funds, and feel free to mention my name in your statement of purpose, given our overlapping interests.
