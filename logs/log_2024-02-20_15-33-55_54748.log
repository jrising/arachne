> Can you explain Subjective expected utility theory to me?
**assistant**:
> Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) theory is a significant normative model of decision making under uncertainty. It was developed by Savage (1954) and is based on several axioms reflecting rational choice behaviors. Here's a brief explanation:
> 
> 1. **Preferences**: Suppose we have a set of possible outcomes O (e.g., gaining $10, losing $10), and a set of "lotteries" L over these outcomes. A lottery is a probabilistic mix of outcomes, like a gamble. For example, a 50% chance of gaining $10 or a 50% chance of losing $10 is a lottery. SEU assumes that an individual has a preference order over these lotteries.
> 
> 2. **Subjective Probabilities**: Each individual assigns subjective probabilities to each outcome in a lottery or event. These probabilities reflect the decision maker's belief about the likelihood of each outcome.
> 
> 3. **Utility**: Each individual assigns a "utility" to each possible outcomeâ€”a measure of its value or desirability to the decision maker. The utility function is designed to capture the individual's risk attitude. 
> 
> 4. **Expected Utility**: To determine the value of a lottery, the individual calculates the "expected utility" of the lottery, which is the sum over all possible outcomes of the product of the probability of the outcome and the utility of the outcome.
> 
> SEU theory suggests that rational individuals choose among lotteries by comparing their expected utilities and choose the one with the highest expected utility.
> 
> While this theory has been very influential, it has also received objections and refinements. Some critics argue that people do not always behave as the theory predicts due to flaws in their thought processes or biases, leading to developments such as Prospect Theory.
> 
> There's much more to say on subjective expected utility theory, especially when it comes to its various axioms and their implications. Is there anything specific you're interested in?
