> Introduction to the illustrative cases. To assist with the use of the principle-based risk assessment frameworks, this section illustrates the application of the guiding questions to two examples of specific ecosystems, called Illustrative Cases. The Illustrative Cases are intended to demonstrate, in a largely qualitative way, how the three phases in the Framework can be navigated. In doing so, findings are incorporated from existing academic literature, newspaper articles, analyses, and tools such as ENCORE and WWF risk filters to arrive at a best-effort understanding of the relevant nature-related financial risks related to those ecosystems. By providing color to the potential use of the phases and guiding questions, the Illustrative Cases showcase how the structure of the Framework may help to break down the complexity of nature-related financial risk assessments into manageable parts. In doing so, these Illustrative Cases seek to facilitate the assessment of nature-related financial risks by central banks and supervisors. Importantly, the Illustrative Cases are not intended to be prescriptive. Nor is an attempt made to offer comprehensive risk assessments for these ecosystems, the jurisdictions in which they are located, or sectors that may depend on or impact these ecosystems. This would require, among other things, substantive further analysis such as quantitative assessments. For guidance on such quantitative assessments and forward-looking recommendations in this regard, reference is made to the Technical Document on Nature Scenarios. The jurisdictions covered by the illustrative cases do not necessarily endorse the analysis or have responsibility for adopting its conclusions. 
> 
> The two Illustrative Cases are based on a freshwater ecosystem and a forest ecosystem. In phase 1 of the framework, it is highlighted that central banks and supervisors may wish to prioritize certain sectors or ecosystems that are more likely to be sources of material risks. For the Illustrative Cases, an ecosystem-based approach was adopted. Without prejudice to the relevance of other types of ecosystems, the Illustrative Cases were based on freshwater ecosystems and forests for the following reason: several national and regional impact and dependency studies highlight the potential economic importance of the ecosystems services provided by freshwater and forest ecosystems. Degradation of these ecosystems and pressure affecting them present recognizable examples of nature-related financial risks. The degradation of these ecosystems is closely linked to climate change, offering an opportunity to highlight the climate-nature nexus. 
> 
> The specific ecosystems selected for the Illustrative Cases are the Colorado River Basin in North America and the Amazon Rainforest in South America. This selection is based on their large size, prominence, and the availability of existing ecological and economic research on these ecosystems. The use of these examples does not imply a view that these are the most critical ecosystems from an economic or financial risk perspective. Instead, they are merely two of many ecosystems that could be used for future examples or studies. Examples include the Nile, Rhine, Yangtze, Ganges, and Congo Rivers, wetlands such as the Pantanal in Brazil or Lake Chilwa wetland in Malawi as well as other rainforests such as the rainforests of Southeast Asia and the Congo Basin.

> When assessing risks related to such other ecosystems, research and data may not always be readily available. In those situations, the Illustrative Cases could provide inspiration to find relevant materials, to search for information on similar ecosystems that could serve as a proxy, and/or to leverage expertise held by local experts and institutions. Even if this does not result in a comprehensive assessment, it may help to answer some of the guiding questions and provide a starting point to progressively improve the understanding of the relevant nature-related financial risks. Those efforts included an extensive search for relevant publicly available materials, as well as feedback on the initial findings by members of the Task Force and outside experts. Despite those efforts to arrive at a balanced and sufficiently comprehensive understanding of potential nature-related financial risks, the information presented in the Case Study is merely intended to provide a starting point and should not be considered as exhaustive. Recommendations toward the development of scenarios for assessing nature-related economic and financial risks were provided by NGFS in December 2023.
