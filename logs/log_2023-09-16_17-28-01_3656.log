> 
>   2023-03-09:
>   Is there an open access version of InstructGPT?; InstructGPT is proprietary, but GPT-3 or open source models like GPT-2, RoBERTa, and BERT can be useful.
> 
> 
> 
>   2023-07-13:
>   Creating map-based survey, off-the-shelf (Survey123, Maptionnaire) or DIY with R Shiny; Shiny can collect data.

> 
> 
> 
>   2023-07-28:
>   James seeks to combine AVX and SSE implementations of dot product using a dynamic VECTOR_SIZE; Arachne provides a solution and suggests caution in handling system support.
> 
> 
> 
>   2023-03-09:
>   James asked about the AI tool Galactica for literature reviews; Arachne clarified that neither Facebook nor Meta developed such a tool.

**user**:
> What would be a good one-word name for stuff that includes both datasets and tools?
**assistant**:
> A suitable one-word name for the combination of datasets and tools could be "Datakit." This name captures the essence of both elements, representing a collection of data and the accompanying tools needed to work with and analyze it.
**user**:
> I meant, like it would be a channel where both new tools and useful datasets could be posted.
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the misunderstanding. For a channel that encompasses both new tools and useful datasets, a good one-word name could be "DataHub." This name suggests a central repository or platform where various data-related resources, including datasets and tools, are shared and made accessible to users. "DataHub" conveys the idea of a hub or central resource for discovering, accessing, and utilizing data and associated tools.
