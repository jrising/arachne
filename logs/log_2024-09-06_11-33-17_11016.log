> I hope this mail finds you well. I am MD Zobayer Rahman, and I am very eager to pursue graduate studies in marine resoureces management at the University of Delaware in the upcoming fall semester of 2025 under your cordial supervision. I have completed my B.Sc. in Fisheries Science from Sylhet Agricultural University, Bangladesh, with a CGPA of 3.927 out of 4.00 (top 2%). I achieved a CGPA of 4.00 out of 4.00 (top 1%) during my Master of Science in Fish Health Management at Sylhet Agricultural University, Bangladesh. My IELTS overall score is 6.5 (S-7.5; R-6.0; W-6.0; L-6.0).
> 
> I have worked on several research projects as an RA (research assistant) in numerous departments of Sylhet Agricultural University and Khulna Agricultural University in Bangladesh. Your impressive profile has convinced me that I can unleash my potential and talent under your guidance. I believe there are several commonalities between your specialization and my research interests. Hence, as a prospective graduate research student, I would appreciate an interview opportunity to demonstrate my potential.

**assistant**:
> MD Zobayer Rahman has expressed interest in graduate studies in marine resources management, which suggests a focus on marine policy or a related field. Based on their background, the Master's in Marine Policy or the Master's in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) with a Marine track could be suitable programs. Zobayer's strong academic performance and research experience could also potentially align with a Ph.D. program if they wish to pursue doctoral studies.
