> I want to show a smooth curve through some points in ggplot2. Specifically, the relationship I have is log(y) ~ x, so it's an exponential decay. But when I do method = 'lm', formula = log(y) ~ x, I get a straight line offset-- so I think it's using the values from log(y) as the y values.

> To visualize an exponential decay using `ggplot2`, you'll need to fit the model using `log(y) ~ x` but transform the predictions back to the original scale of `y`. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:
> 
> 1. **Fit the model**: Fit a linear model to `log(y) ~ x` to obtain your parameters on the log scale.
> 2. **Transform the predictions**: Exponentiate the predictions to transform them back to the original scale of `y`.
> 3. **Create a smooth curve in ggplot2**: Use `geom_line()` for the transformed predictions.

**user**:
> Can I also get this with the uncertainty bounds, like geom_smooth shows?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely! You can add uncertainty bounds to your exponential decay model in `ggplot2` using a combination of `geom_smooth()` with a custom formula. However, since `geom_smooth()` doesn't directly support transforming the predicted values back to the original scale for custom formulas, you can achieve this by extracting the fitted values and confidence intervals manually.

> ### Explanation:
> 1. **Model Fitting**: The `lm()` function fits the linear model on the log scale.
> 2. **Predictions with Confidence Intervals**: Use `predict(..., interval = "prediction")` to get the fit and its lower and upper bounds.
> 3. **Transforming Back**: Use `mutate()` from `dplyr` to exponentiate the fitted values and the bounds.
> 4. **Plotting**: 
>    - `geom_point()` shows the original data.
>    - `geom_line()` displays the fitted curve.
>    - `geom_ribbon()` adds a shaded area between the lower and upper bounds for uncertainty visualization.
> 
> This will give you a smooth exponential decay curve along with shaded uncertainty bounds.
