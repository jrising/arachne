> I would like to include a glossary of terms in a perspective article I am writing called "Bridging the Disconnect: A Joint Perspective on Economic and Physical Sciences of Climate Risks", intended to be published simultaneously in a natural science and economics journal. I was imagining separate sections for (1) physical and biological science terms and (2) social science and economics. I am particularly interested in terms relevant to how each field understands climate risks but are likely to be misunderstood by the other field. Common terms like "climate change" and "greenhouse gases" can be omitted. Can you provide some suggestions for this glossary?

> ### Physical and Biological Science Terms (might be misunderstood by Social Science and Economics readers)
> 
> **1. Radiative Forcing:** A change in the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation. Without any radiative forcing, solar radiation coming to the Earth would continue to be approximately equal to the infrared radiation emitted from Earth. The resulting imbalance due to greenhouse gases forces the climate system to change.
> 
> **2. Carbon Sequestration:** The long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide or other forms of carbon to either mitigate or defer global warming and avoid dangerous climate change.
> 
> **3. Albedo Effect:** The measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed. It's related to climate because surfaces that reflect more light cool more quickly and contribute to lower global temperatures.
> 
> **4. Climate Sensitivity:** A measure of how responsive the temperature of the climate system is to a change in the radiative forcing. It is usually expressed as the temperature change associated with a doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere.
> 
> **5. Permafrost:** Ground, including rock or soil, with a temperature that remains at or below the freezing point of water for two or more years. Significant in climate dynamics due to its capability to sequester large amounts of carbon.
> 
> **6. Anthropogenic Biomes:** Also known as "anthromes" or "human biomes", are globally significant ecological patterns within the terrestrial biosphere caused by sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems.
> 
> **7. Marine Heatwaves:** Prolonged periods of unusually warm water in the ocean, these events have been increasing in frequency with climate change and significantly impact marine life and systems.
>       
> **8. Tipping Elements:** Components of the Earth system that could be tipped into qualitatively different states by small external perturbations, which in turn might lead to severe consequences for large proportions of the planetary ecosystem.
> 
> 
> ### Social Science and Economics Terms (might be misunderstood by Physical and Biological Science readers)
> 
> **1. Carbon Credit:** A generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the rights to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or the mass of another greenhouse gas with a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide.
> 
> **2. Externality:** Costs or benefits that affect a party who did not choose to incur those costs or benefits, often used in the context of negative externalities related to environmental costs.
> 
> **3. Cap And Trade:** An approach to managing and minimizing the pollution impacts of certain human activities. Specifically, 'cap and trade' is used for controlling emissions considered harmful to the environment.
> 
> **4. Contingent Valuation:** A method of estimating the value that a person places on a good. The process of ascribing a value to non-market goods or services, like ecosystem benefits.
> 
> **5. Discount Rate:** In the context of climate change, this is a key factor in how society values future damages from global warming versus the costs of immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
> 
> **6. Risk Aversion:** The behavior of humans, when exposed to uncertainty, in attempting to lower that uncertainty or mitigating potential harm.
> 
> **7. Path Dependency:** The tendency of institutions, cultures, technologies, or methodologies to be shaped by their pastâ€”relevant in understanding why certain harmful climate behaviors continue despite evidence of their negative impacts.
> 
> **8. Energy Poverty:** The situation where individuals or households are not able to access adequate energy services, which can influence climate injustice and the uneven impacts of climate change.
> 
> **9. Just Transition:** A framework that has been developed by the trade union movement to encompass a range of social interventions needed to secure workers' rights and livelihoods when economies are shifting to sustainable production.
> 
> **10. Non-Marginal Changes:** Large-scale changes that significantly shift markets or systems, away from the standard economic assumption of small, gradual, or incremental changes. Large shocks to economic systems, such as those that could occur with extreme climate events, are examples of non-marginal changes.

> I think many of the terms at the top will be general knowledge and many across the list are unlikely to impede collaboration (people know when they need to look them up). Here are some terms I think are important to add:
> Physical...:
>  - Exposure (and other elements of how the IPCC understands impacts)
>  - Biophysical/Process-based model (the predominant impact modeling approach coming from the sciences and engineering)
>  - Reasons For Concern (RFC) (maybe also relate these to planetary boundaries?)
> Economic...:
>  - Marginal (scientists are used to the term derivative)
>  - Social welfare function (relate to discounting)
>  - Economic damages (note that it is not the same as financial loss or GDP)
**assistant**:
> Great suggestions! Here are the additional terms for your glossary:
> 
> ### Physical and Biological Science Terms:
> - **Exposure**: The nature and degree to which a system, element, or population is exposed to climate hazards. It encompasses the presence of people, ecosystems, or assets in places that could be adversely affected.
> - **Biophysical/Process-based model**: A modeling approach used in physical and biological sciences that simulates the physical processes and interactions in the natural world to understand the impacts of climate change.
> - **Reasons For Concern (RFC)**: A framework utilized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that identifies and categorizes key risks and vulnerabilities associated with climate change across various sectors and systems. Relating RFCs to planetary boundaries can help assess the state and overshoot of Earth's natural limits.
> 
> ### Social Science and Economics Terms:
> - **Marginal**: In economics, the term "marginal" refers to the additional or incremental change resulting from a small adjustment or unit of input. It is often used to analyze the impact of small changes on economic outcomes or behavior.
> - **Social welfare function**: A concept in economics that captures the overall well-being or utility derived from the consumption of goods and services by a society. It provides a framework for evaluating policies and decision-making processes.
> - **Economic damages**: Refers to the quantifiable economic costs associated with impacts or losses resulting from climate change. It goes beyond financial losses or declines in GDP by considering the broader economic consequences across sectors, such as infrastructure damage, reduced agricultural productivity, or increased healthcare expenses.
> 
> Including these terms will help promote a better understanding of the key concepts and facilitate collaboration across the physical and biological sciences, as well as social science and economics.
**user**:
> Let's also add:
> Physical...:
>  - Hazard (as understood in the IPCC risk framework)
> Economic...:
>  - Marginal effect (this is better to include than just "Marginal") - but maybe clarify that marginal effect is the derivative while marginal is a small change.
>  - Econometric model
> 
> Also, can you clarify the definition of RFCs? As written, it could mean any kind of risk, but RFCs are particularly pervasive.
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are the additional terms and a clarification for RFCs:
> 
> ### Physical and Biological Science Terms:
> - **Hazard**: In the context of the IPCC risk framework, a hazard refers to a potentially damaging physical event or phenomenon, such as heatwaves, floods, storms, or droughts, which can pose risks to human and natural systems.
> 
> ### Economic Terms:
> - **Marginal effect**: The term "marginal effect" refers to the change in an outcome or response resulting from a small incremental change in a specific variable. It is often used in econometric analysis to understand the impact of one variable on another.
> - **Econometric model**: A statistical model used in economics that seeks to analyze and quantify the relationships and patterns between economic variables. Econometric models are commonly employed to estimate and predict economic phenomena, such as the effects of policy interventions or the relationship between variables.
> 
> ### Clarification for RFCs:
> RFCs (Reasons For Concern) are a core part of the IPCC's risk framework, aiming to highlight key risks associated with climate change. They are not intended to include any kind of risk, but rather represent specific categories of risks that are recognized as particularly pervasive and relevant to human and natural systems. RFCs offer a structured way of categorizing and assessing the potential impacts of climate change, helping policymakers and researchers understand the urgency and severity of specific risks and their potential consequences.
