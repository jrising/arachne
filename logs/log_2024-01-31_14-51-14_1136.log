> What resolution does the NOAA Fisheries’ Marine Recreational Information Program's MRIP Query Tool currently have? I see an update that it "wave-level" catch and effort data will be available in the future-- what does that mean?
**assistant**:
> The NOAA Fisheries’ Marine Recreational Information Program's (MRIP) Query Tool typically provides data at the level of individual trips or fishing events. The resolution varies depending on the availability and accuracy of the data, and can range from local (such as a particular body of water) to regional (such as the entire U.S. East Coast).
> 
> Wave-level data refers to a more specific temporal resolution within a year. In the context of the MRIP, a "wave" is a two-month interval. Thus, there are six waves in a year: 
> 1. Wave 1: January and February
> 2. Wave 2: March and April
> 3. Wave 3: May and June
> 4. Wave 4: July and August
> 5. Wave 5: September and October
> 6. Wave 6: November and December   
> 
> So, the update about "wave-level" data means that NOAA is planning to provide the MRIP data at this more granular temporal scale, which can enable more precise analysis of temporal patterns in marine recreational fishing activity.
