> What projects have attempted a comprehensive assessment of climate risks?
**assistant**:
> Several projects and organizations have attempted to provide comprehensive assessments of climate risks. These assessments typically evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems, human health, infrastructure, and the economy. Some notable examples include:
> 
> 1. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports: The IPCC is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, producing periodic assessment reports since 1990. These reports are based on a comprehensive analysis of scientific, technical, and socio-economic information and provide insights into climate change, its impacts, potential risks, and strategies for mitigation and adaptation.
> 
> 2. United States National Climate Assessment (NCA): The NCA is a congressionally mandated report produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) that provides a comprehensive assessment of the current understanding of climate change impacts and risks in the United States.
> 
> 3. European Environment Agency (EEA) Climate Change Adaptation Reports: The EEA produces regular reports that evaluate the state of climate change adaptation in Europe, providing information on observed and projected climate change impacts, vulnerability assessments, and adaptation actions.
> 
> 4. Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative: This initiative, managed by the World Bank, focuses on enhancing early warning systems and improving climate risk management in vulnerable countries to better protect lives and livelihoods from climate change impacts.
> 
> 5. The World Resources Institute (WRI) Climate Risk and Adaptation Atlas: The WRI atlas is an interactive tool that enables users to visualize climate risks and explore adaptation options at a regional level.
> 
> 6. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) National Adaptation Plans (NAPs): The NAPs are a set of guidelines and support mechanisms aimed at helping countries identify and address climate risks through the development of national adaptation strategies.
> 
> These assessments and initiatives involve collaboration between governments, international organizations, academia, and the private sector. They provide valuable information and resources for policymakers and stakeholders to develop strategies to manage and mitigate climate risks.

> What projects have attempted a comprehensive assessment of climate risks, calculating total welfare losses across all impacts?
**assistant**:
> Assessing total welfare losses across all climate change impacts is an incredibly complex task, as it requires accounting for various factors, such as the economic, social, and environmental consequences of climate change. However, several projects and models have attempted to provide an integrated assessment of climate risks and calculate the potential welfare losses associated with different climate change scenarios. Some of these include:
> 
> 1. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): IAMs are a class of computational models that aim to synthesize knowledge across disciplines to better understand the complex interactions between climate change, the economy, and society. Examples of well-known IAMs include the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model by William Nordhaus, the Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation, and Distribution (FUND) model by Richard Tol, and the Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE) model by Chris Hope. IAMs provide an integrated framework for estimating climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation costs, and welfare losses, though there are significant uncertainties associated with these models.
> 
> 2. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change: Published in 2006 by the UK government, this report, led by economist Sir Nicholas Stern, is considered one of the most comprehensive analyses of the economic consequences of climate change. The Stern Review estimated the welfare losses from climate change by assessing the costs and benefits of taking action against climate change versus not taking action, providing a range for potential welfare losses based on different climate change scenarios.
> 
> 3. The Climate Impact Lab (CIL): The CIL is a collaboration between economists, climate scientists, and data engineers that aims to quantify the social and economic impacts of climate change at a granular level. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the CIL has developed comprehensive assessments of climate risks and their welfare implications across various sectors, such as agriculture, health, and energy.
> 
> While these projects and models attempt to provide a comprehensive assessment of climate risks and welfare losses, it is important to note that there are inherent uncertainties and limitations in these estimates due to the complexities of modeling the various factors involved in climate change and its impacts on human welfare.
**user**:
> Are there academic papers that claim to calculate a total welfare loss across all climate risks, for any region?
**assistant**:
> While there is no single academic paper that claims to provide a complete and definitive calculation of total welfare loss across all climate risks for any specific region, there are papers that attempt to assess welfare losses related to specific sectors or climate risks in certain regions. 
> 
> These papers typically use Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), sector-specific models, or regional-scale models to estimate welfare losses resulting from climate change impacts. Some examples of academic papers addressing welfare losses related to specific risks or sectors include:

> 
> These studies address specific aspects of welfare losses in the context of regional climate risks, but they do not provide a comprehensive assessment of all climate risks for any region. The inherent complexities and uncertainties in estimating the total welfare loss across all climate risks make it difficult for any single study to cover all aspects of this challenge.
**user**:
> Are there academic papers that perform an expert elicitation of the total welfare loss across all climate risks, for any region?
**assistant**:
> Expert elicitation is a method used to gather opinions, judgments, or insights from experts when there is limited empirical evidence or high levels of uncertainty. While expert elicitations have been conducted on several aspects of climate change, it is difficult to find a specific study that focuses solely on expert elicitation of total welfare loss across all climate risks for any region.
> 
> However, there are a few studies that use expert elicitation to assess the economic costs of climate change and potential welfare implications in certain areas. These studies can provide some insight into the welfare losses due to climate change. Some examples include:

> What academic papers is the damage function in DICE based on?
**assistant**:
> The Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, developed by economist William Nordhaus, uses a damage function to estimate the economic costs of climate change. The damage function relates changes in global mean temperature to a reduction in global economic output (GDP). The development of the DICE model's damage function is based on several sources, primarily from the existing literature on climate change impacts and cost estimates.
> 
> Some of the academic papers and reports that have informed the development of the DICE model's damage function include:
> 
> 1. Nordhaus, W. D. (1991). To slow or not to slow: The economics of the greenhouse effect. The Economic Journal, 101(407), 920-937. This is an early paper by Nordhaus that laid the foundation for the DICE model, including the formulation of the damage function.

> 
> It is essential to note that the damage function in the DICE model has evolved through multiple iterations and revisions over time. It has incorporated various sources and assumptions based on new scientific findings and economic research. However, the DICE model's damage function is still an area of ongoing research, and there is a considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the true magnitude of the economic costs of climate change.
**user**:
> How have economic researchers thought about the problem of being comprehensive in climate risks, given the current limitations of our knowledge?
**assistant**:
> Economic researchers have acknowledged the complexity and uncertainty involved in comprehensively assessing climate risks, given the current limitations of our knowledge. To deal with these challenges, researchers have adopted several approaches and methods:
> 
> 1. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): IAMs, such as the DICE, FUND, and PAGE models, are designed to synthesize knowledge across disciplines and represent the complex interactions between the climate system, the economy, and society. These models account for climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation costs, and welfare losses under different scenarios, even though they may not cover every single impact comprehensively.
> 
> 2. Scenario Analysis: Scenario analysis is widely used to explore a range of plausible future outcomes based on different assumptions about climate change impacts, socioeconomic development, and policy responses. This approach helps decision-makers and stakeholders to better understand the potential consequences of different pathways and to develop robust strategies in the face of uncertainty.
> 
> 3. Expert Elicitation: Expert elicitation is a method used to gather opinions, judgments, or insights from experts when empirical evidence is limited or highly uncertain. Expert elicitation has been used in various climate change studies, such as assessing the potential economic costs of climate change, estimating probabilities of extreme events or tipping points, and identifying effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.
> 
> 4. Meta-analyses: Meta-analyses combine and synthesize findings from multiple individual studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a particular research question. This approach can help overcome some of the limitations in single studies and provide a broader perspective on the range and distribution of possible climate change impacts and associated costs.
> 
> 5. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Economic researchers have increasingly recognized the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to better understand the complex and multifaceted nature of climate change risks. By collaborating with climate scientists, ecologists, social scientists, and other experts, economists can improve their understanding of climate change impacts and design more effective policy interventions.
> 
> 6. Emphasizing Uncertainty and Risk Management: Researchers have highlighted the need to communicate and manage uncertainties surrounding climate change impacts and economic assessments. They emphasize the importance of risk management, precautionary measures, and adaptive planning to build resilience in the face of uncertain climate risks.
> 
> Despite these efforts, researchers acknowledge that it is currently impossible to be fully comprehensive in assessing all climate risks due to the limitations of our knowledge and the inherent complexities involved. Nonetheless, they continue to improve methods and models to better capture and communicate the potential consequences of climate change and inform policy decisions.

> 
> Although these papers do not provide a fully comprehensive estimate of damages, they do attempt to provide an extensive assessment of climate change impacts on a regional or global scale. The estimates from these studies are often subject to various assumptions and uncertainties, but they offer valuable insights into potential damages due to climate change.
**user**:
> I am skeptical that any of these make a claim of comprehensiveness. Stern is an early result; Hsiang et al. (2017) uses only 5 sectors; Dell, Jones, & Olken only discuss GDP damages. Where is there an attempt to be truly comprehensive?
**assistant**:
> You are correct in noting that the papers and reports mentioned previously do not claim to provide a fully comprehensive assessment of all climate change damages. Indeed, it is currently a significant challenge to produce a truly comprehensive estimate due to the complexities and uncertainties involved in assessing the diverse impacts of climate change across various sectors and regions.
> 
> However, these studies do provide a more extensive assessment of damages than many other studies, as they try to include as many relevant aspects as possible given the state of knowledge at the time. Researchers are continuously working to refine their methods and models to better capture and communicate the potential consequences of climate change.
> 
> To address the comprehensive aspect of your question, it is important to recognize that while no single study or model may offer a completely comprehensive estimate, synthesizing insights from various studies and disciplines can help provide a more robust understanding of the potential damages from climate change.
> 
> It is also worth noting that there is a growing focus on incorporating various climate change impacts into integrated assessment models (IAMs) to better reflect the wide-ranging consequences of climate change on human welfare. For example, recent iterations of models such as DICE, FUND, and PAGE have attempted to include additional aspects of climate change impacts, such as health effects, ecosystem services, and non-market damages.
> 
> Nevertheless, the quest for a truly comprehensive estimate of damages remains elusive due to the inherent limitations of our knowledge and the complex nature of the problem. As such, it is crucial to focus on risk management and precautionary approaches to address climate change impacts and to continuously update our understanding as new knowledge emerges.
