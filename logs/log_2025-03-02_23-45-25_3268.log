> Below is my assessment of an ongoing grant project:
> ===
> 2.1 Objectives and work plan
> Is the progress in line with work plan as specified in the DoA? If there are significant deviations, please comment.
> Please split this section into two parts.
> 1. Objectives (this part is a bit repetitive with section 2.1 (question 1), it should be more detailed here and more general above):
> •	Assess to what extent the objectives of the project as described in the DoA have been achieved.
> •	In particular, indicate if the project as a whole has been making satisfactory progress in relation to what was described in the DoA. 
> 2. Work packages: For each work package (WP):
> •	Assess the progress in relation to the DoA (including the achievement of deliverables and milestones).
> •	Comment on any significant deviation and/or delays, the reasons for them and corrective action taken.
> 
> On both points, more information will be provided in the periodic report.	Yes
> The deliverables and achieved milestones closely follow the specifications in the DoA, despite some identified deviations.
> 1. Objectives
> Progress is being made toward O1, although (1) the concrete incorporation of stakeholder co-creation input and (2) the reporting of distributional consequences needs to be further developed. (1) There is an apparent lack of integration between stakeholder activities and modelling. This is further discussed under deliverable D1.3. (2) It is understood that distributional aspects are to be developed under T4.2.
> Appropriate plans are in evidence to achieve O2, O3, and O4.
> The success of O5 will depend upon effective stakeholder co-creation of the project outputs. There is evidence of continued interaction with deep engagement stakeholders, in addition to the co-design workshop. However, it is hoped that concrete pathways of uptake would be identified through these interactions by this point in the project, and those are not enumerated.
> 2. Work packages:
> The stock-take in D1.1 has multiple identified gaps, and a lack of general synthesis of the various physical impacts, economic impacts, and adaptation costs and benefits.
> The content in D1.3 raises questions about the extent to which stakeholder concerns are allowed to direct the work of the project. More needs to be done to justify the many cases where partner questions which are not considered priorities by stakeholders are given precedence over those that are priorities.
> Some of the modelling assumptions used in D2.2 may have significant implications for the usefulness of these results to stakeholders. More information should be provided on modelling assumptions, and in many cases, comparative evaluations between modelling assumptions are needed.
> A revision is requested of D2.3 to address a number of methodological points, including choices around weather hazards, econometric controls, and the cost-benefit analysis of AC subsides.
> D2.3 has not assessed health impacts of extreme flood events. This was previously identified as critical implementation risk 8, with a mitigation action of drawing on other estimates for similar regions. This mitigation action has not been performed. In the absence of internal estimates, a systematic review of the literature is needed to identify appropriate estimates and the limitations of the existing knowledge base, and to apply the estimates to the extent possible.
> A revision is requested for D5.2. While a broad range of activities are described, key information on audiences and a pathway to the general public by way of stakeholders are missing.
> The progress toward other deliverables is appropriate.
> Are the objectives of the project still scientifically, technologically and economically relevant?
> Assess whether the project continues to be scientifically, technologically and economically relevant.
> Indicate whether the objectives are still relevant and ambitious (i.e. provide exceptional ground-breaking R&I, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models), and whether they are still achievable within the time and resources available. 
> Assess also whether the approach and methodology continue to be relevant.
> Please split this section into 2 sub-sections as per the general instructions:
> 1. Relevance of the project and of its objectives.
> •	Please provide here a general assessment on objectives.
> More information will be provided in the periodic report. The consortium is requested to report progress per objective with references to project's achievements.
> 
> 2. Relevance of the approach and methodology.
> Please check the methodology of the project as per DoA and based on the results achieved, assess whether the approach and methodology are still relevant.	Yes 
> [insert comments to justify the answer]
> 1. Relevance of the project and its objectives.
> If anything, adaptation in the EU has become an even more pressing issue, and actionable information on adaptation costs and benefits is central to effective policy-making. The high-resolution results provided by the project, well-grounded in the frontier of knowledge, are an excellent and essential component of this.
> 2. Relevance of the approach and methodology.
> The impact assessments draw upon both state-of-the-art process-based models, and effective econometric approaches. The adaptation strategy process (D3.1) is also state-of-the-art. The SSP-based scenarios and adaptation storylines used are appropriate for this kind of work. 
> Critical risks
> •	Are the critical implementation risks described in the DoA still relevant?
> •	Have new critical implementation risks been identified?
> •	Have the relevant risks been properly mitigated with adequate measures?
> Please see the information provided in the periodic report.	Yes 
> Three critical risks materialised, and one of these (Risk No. 8) has resulted in a deviation from the DoA. Of the remaining risks that could still emerge, Risk Nos 5 and 6 required continued watching.
> Risk No 5: Integration across methodologies is essential for the success of the project. Although pre-emptive mitigation planning has been performed, new problems may emerge when the actual integration is needed. 
> Risk No. 6: Some (but not all) key outputs from WP2 have already been provided, but outputs from WP3 are still needed. The success of WP4 depends on these inputs, and minor delays that have already occurred could push the work further back.
> Does the project respect the ‘do no significant harm’ principle? 
> Assess, where relevant, if the project methodology complies with the ‘do no significant harm’ principle set out in Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation No 2020/852, i.e. that it is designed in a way to not significantly harm any of the following six environmental objectives :
> 	climate change mitigation
> 	climate change adaptation
> 	sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
> 	transition to a circular economy
> 	pollution prevention and control
> 	protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.	Yes 
> Existing outputs are informational, and implicitly respect the “do no significant harm” principle. The adaptation case studies appear to respect this principle, however the changing of stakeholders in the deviations under T3.2 may justify a closer look.
> Is the gender dimension appropriately taken into account?
> Assess how the gender dimension (i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s research and innovation content. If the project has considered that the gender dimension is not relevant, assess whether the justification provided in the proposal is still relevant. 
> Note: Here ‘sex and/or gender dimension’ refers to the subject of the project, not to the researchers involved.
> Please check DoA (Part B) and any relevant deliverables tackling this point. The consortium was asked to report on this in the periodic report. 	Partially 
> Gender is sometimes taken into consideration in the analyses (e.g., heatwaves on economic wellbeing), but it is limited to a control variable. Climate impacts are differential by gender, given both the distributions of exposure and vulnerability, and this is an important point to be considered. The DoA specifies that gender will be considered explicitly in socioeconomic impacts, but this is not described sufficiently in the deliverables.
> The gender ratio across researchers is excellent, and the level of resources is appropriately distributed, but is not clear how this translates to how gender dimensions are captured in the project’s research.
> Does the project respect the commitments concerning open science as described in the DoA? Is it undertaking additional open science practices? 
> Assess the extent to which the project has engaged in the open science practices described in the DoA.
> In addition, assess whether the project has engaged in additional open science practices. 
> Such practices may include: 
> 	early and open sharing of research (for example, through pre-registration, registered reports, pre-preprints or crowd-sourcing)
> 	research data deposited in trusted repositories federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)
> 	for research outputs other than publications and data: research output management in line with FAIR
> 	for research outputs other than publication and data: deposition in trusted repositories and granting them open access 
> 	actions with regards to enhancing the reproducibility of results 
> 	participation in open peer review actions
> 	involvement of relevant knowledge actors, including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents	Yes 
> Open Science practices are embedded in ACCREU. However, there are some considerations to be watched in future evaluations. First, most data remains unavailable, and will only be released with publications. It is important, then, that publications are achieved across the full range of data and in a timely manner. Second, the DoA mentioned significant data being provided on stakeholder engagement. This is not currently evidenced.
> Is the project adequately integrating social sciences or/and humanities? (for SSH topics)
> Assess if the project has adequately engaged in an effective integration of social sciences or/and humanities, as outlined in the DoA. If only partially or not at all, does the project provide an acceptable justification and corrective measures?
> Note: Projects funded under SSH-flagged topics should show an effective integration of social sciences or/and humanities, unless justified in the proposal that these disciplines are not relevant for the project.	Yes 
> The main social science/humanity contribution described in the DoA is through economics. This is being adequately incorporated into results. The DoA does mention engaging with political science, but this is not currently evidenced. Other humanities which could be helpful in achieving project goals are not identified in the DoA.
> Have the ethics/security deliverables due for the current period been adequately addressed and approved?
> The proposal was ethics and security cleared (i.e., no significant ethics issues were recognised). Regardless, some ethics issues concerning involvement of humans (e.g. participation in project events, stakeholder workshops, case studies) and processing of their personal data (e.g. through surveys), and involvement of non-EU countries (UK and Vietnam with potentially some benefit-sharing actions, e.g. data sharing, import/export).
> DoA (Part B) and D6.1 tackle these issues, and more information might be provided in the periodic report. I don’t expect to you to go into much detail here, however, based on your best knowledge, please assess if the project is sufficiently addressing ethics issues and record here if some of the activities raise your concerns in terms of ethics and security issues.	Not applicable
> The Ethics Management Plan was outside of the collection of deliverables I was asked to review.

> 2.2 Impact
> Is the proposed pathway to achieve the expected outcomes and impacts still credible?
> Please list the expected outcomes and impacts as per DoA (Part B) and provide your assessment for each expected impact (and related outcomes) as per general instructions.
> •	Assess the credibility of the expected outcomes and impacts in terms of scientific, economic/technological and societal aspects. 
> •	Assess whether there is any potential negative environmental outcome or impact of the project, including when expected results are brought at scale (such as at commercial level) and, if yes, whether the project proposes how to manage this.
> Note that more information will be provided in the periodic report which should help you in the preparation of your assessment.	Yes 
> EO1: Appropriate progress is being made toward this EO.
> EO2: Both sudden onset events and slow onset processes are being considered across the WP2 impact assessments. However, in many cases, impacts susceptible to both sudden and slow processes are not both considered. For example, health and wellbeing results rely upon econometric methods, which largely describe the effects of shocks. Natural disasters (e.g., as described in EM-DAT) are generally not being studied.
> EO3: Appropriate progress is being made toward this EO.
> EO4: Appropriate progress is being made toward this EO.
> EO5: As discussed under O5 and D5.2, the concrete pathway for informing public and private decisions is not yet clear.
> EO6: Appropriate progress is being made toward this EO.

> How will the project have an impact on policy making (if any)?
> Assess whether:
> •	The project results or activities will contribute to designing, monitoring, reviewing and adjusting (if necessary) existing policy and programmatic measures or 
> •	Whether the project will contribute to shaping and supporting the implementation of new policy initiatives and decisions, (e.g. healthcare, transport, environment, energy, migration, regional development, etc.) by supporting policy implementation, policy stakeholder engagement or exploring new technological approaches for policy objectives. 
> When writing your assessment, please be specific about which policies were addressed and how well, and provide recommendations if any.
> More information will be provided in the periodic report, however, some information might be extracted from some deliverables.	Yes 
> Please indicate the EU headline priorities to which the project has contributed or will contribute to. 
> The project was requested to address in the periodic report how it contributes to the headline priorities.
> Please assess the progress of the project to contribute to the priorities (also against the DoA). The most relevant is the European Green Deal, while others (may) have less importance in project’s context.
> However, if you see other priorities are relevant and the project contributes to any (or could/should contribute to), please mention it. Other EU priorities are not so relevant for this project but if you see any other  or other listed here.	European Green Deal
> 
> The project has contributed to Horizon destination 1. Stakeholders have stated that ACCREU results are expected to provide input to local, national, and EU-level policy making.
> However, as described above, using the connection with stakeholders to identify concrete pathways for impact is essential and not currently shown.
> Are the measures to maximise impact still suitable? (n/a for EIC Pathfinder)
> Please check DoA (Part B), section 2.2, tasks in relevant WPs and any relevant deliverables submitted
> •	Assess whether the planned measures to maximise the impact as set up in the plan for the dissemination and exploitation including communication activities are proportionate to the scale of the project, and contain concrete actions to be implemented both during and after the end of the project, e.g. standardisation activities.
> Are the measures for public/stakeholder engagement properly implemented?
> Are the measures for raising awareness about the project outputs/outcomes, including through open science, efficient?
> Are the exploitation measures to facilitate translation of research results into innovations with societal or economic impact are effective (i.e. end-users testing and industrial design, IPR and freedom to operate, standardisation, regulation …)?
> •	Assess whether why each measure chosen is best suited to reach the target group addressed. Are the measures still realistic and achievable. Please provide recommendations on the adjustments to the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities.
> •	Where relevant, and for innovation actions, include in your assessment the measures for a plausible path to commercialise the innovations. This is a research and innovation action (RIA). Nevertheless, please provide your assessment whether commercialisation of project’s outputs is plausible (is it foreseen in the exploitation plan?). Provide recommendations if any.	Partially 
> As described elsewhere, there is a concern that stakeholders have not been provided with concrete ways to shape the project, and as a result the outcomes remain traditionally academic. The project does not set out sufficiently concrete ways that stakeholder opinions will be incorporated, or how ACCREU outputs will be shaped to maximise impact through these stakeholders.
> Are the measures for public/stakeholder engagement properly implemented? (for EIC Pathfinder)

> 2.3 Implementation
> Has the project been efficiently and effectively managed (including risk management)?
> Assess how the project is managed, is it in line with the planning. Mention significant delays, necessary changes to the work plan, etc. If there is room for improvement, please provide recommendations.	Yes 
> The project and risks are being effectively managed, as evidenced by the existing deliverables.
> Have all the obligations described in the grant agreement (contract) been respected by the participants (including ethics and security requirements, if applicable)? 	Yes 
>  
> 
> Have all participants contributed to the project according to the work-plan described in the DoA? 
> Please assess here if the partners performed the work as planned. Please mention if significant deviations are noticed/reported and whether they are justified and mitigated without significant impact or risks to the project.
> More information will be provided in the periodic report. 	Yes 
> As far as the provided materials show, all participants are effectively contributing to the progress of the project.
> 
> Have the EIC beneficiaries protected the IPR of the results with market potential (foreground) as planned in the DoA (including patents filing or any other formal IPR protection)? How do the beneficiaries plan to get return on investment over the generated IP? (for EIC Pathfinder)
> This question is not applicable to this project. Please mark ‘not applicable’.	[Yes][No][Partially][Not applicable]
> Not applicable
> 
> Have the participants disseminated project results (foreground) and have they communicated project activities and results as planned in the DoA (e.g. through publications, a page for the project on social media, press-releases, a website, video/film, etc.) and have they included a reference to EU funding?
> Please check the DoA and relevant deliverables, publications, etc. Some information will also be provided in the periodic report.	Partially
> The academic dissemination of the outputs is an area needing further watching over the next months. Only four publications have been produced, and this channel for dissemination may be underused.
> Only one policy brief is currently online, although Milestone 14 specifies 5 policy briefs. This is an important output that still needs to be developed.
> Has the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results (if required) been updated and implemented as described in the DoA, in particular as regards intellectual property rights?   Give details if a (further) update is needed.
> How effective were the measures planned? (only for final report) 
> Not applicable to this review.	[Yes][No][Partially][Not applicable]
> 
> 
> If the plan for exploitation and dissemination provides for exploitation primarily in non-associated third countries, have the participants explained how that exploitation is still in the EU interest? Is it acceptable?
> Please comment here also if the communication, dissemination and exploitation plan should be adjusted or updated.	Not applicable
>  
> 
> Are the critical implementation risks and mitigation actions described in the DoA still relevant?
> Assess how the identified risks in the project are managed, including the new risks identified in the reporting period, if any, and the proposed mitigation measures. 
> This information will be provided in the periodic report.	[Yes][No][Partially][Not applicable]
> Only one set of implementation risks is provided, and this is discussed above under “Critical Risks”.
> 
> 2.3. Resources (n/a for Lump Sum and Unit Grants)
> Were the resources used as described in the DoA and were they necessary to achieve the project objectives? 
> This information is (will be) provided in the periodic report. Please focus here on the effort (person-months) reported are reasonable and in line with the performed work (see descriptions of the WPs in the periodic report).
> Please report any issues at project or partner level.	Yes 
> Resources appear to be appropriately distributed across the consortium partners, consistent with their planned contributions to the project and the stage of work they are in. The one exception is the funding provided to the Cyprus Institute, which is comparatively high for its level of contribution. Cyl is leading one task, but has over the median level of resources, and has a funding level nearly as high as some of the work package leaders. However, since this is a Hop On member, which presumably came with additional resources through that process, it is not a barrier to achieving the project goals. 
> If there are significant deviations from planned budget, have they been satisfactorily justified?
> Assess whether they been used in a manner consistent with the principle of sound financial management (in particular economy, efficiency and effectiveness)
> This information is (will be) provided in the periodic report. Please focus here on the total amounts claimed (at project and partner level). It is not necessary to go into details per cost category, unless you notice some issues.	No 
> The budget is progressing as planned.
> If unforeseen subcontracting costs are declared, do you agree with them? (n/a for expert report)
> This information is (will be) provided in the periodic report. Please assess if the circumstances and costs are justified. 	Not applicable
> No unforeseen subcontracting costs.
> If unforeseen in-kind contributions costs are declared, do you agree with them? (n/a for expert report)
> This information is (will be) provided in the periodic report. Please assess if the circumstances and costs are justified.	Not applicable
> No unforeseen in-kind contributions.

> Deliverable number	Deliverable name	Status	Comments
> D1.1	Project research framing and stocktaking report	Submitted

> Request for revision 	
> The extensiveness of the review of the literature on climate impacts and adaptation in the EU is commendable.
> 
> While the SSP2-based scenarios chose are methodologically defensible, it is concerning that scenarios were presented to stakeholders as already chosen, and that their requests (to use alternative socioeconomics, consider NGFS scenarios, use stochastic scenarios, and use scenarios appropriate to shorter timelines) were largely ignored. D1.3 presents adaptation narratives within these socioeconomic assumptions, but the stakeholder feedback in D1.1 suggests that the concern is that different socioeconomics (e.g., income levels and demographics) are key to the adaptation question, not independent of it. Formulate a process to address stakeholder scenario concerns using these scenario results.
>  
> The studies mentioned under agriculture have a wide range of assumptions (role of natural disasters, labour effects, irrigation availability, carbon fertilisation). Provide a better synthesis of this.
> 
> Add top-down analyses of agricultural productivity (e.g., Acevedo et al. 2020, Newell et al. 2021) to the agricultural section.
> 
> Add the impact of AMOC weakening (e.g., Ritchie et al. 2020) to agriculture.
> 
> Add a stock-take of livestock, since the existing agriculture section appears to only consider horticulture.
> 
> Arguably, the most important adaptation for fisheries to climate change is improved scientific management. Depending on the current regime, these practices can result in a much greater increase in economic output than the losses from climate change. Add a synthesis of the extensive experience on the costs and benefits for such policies under climate change.
> 
> In the adaptation to drought section, add discussion of standard water demand policies, including improved irrigation, and the role of groundwater management.
> 
> The adaptation section for energy is unlike the other adaptation sections. There is no information provided on adaptation options available to address impacts on energy supply. The energy demand services that are described are adaptations to other sectors and relate to the adaptation costs incurred there. Add a discussion of adaptation to address energy supply impacts.
> 
> It is surprising that the authors claim “The specific impacts of climate change on biodiversity … are reasonably well understood.” These impacts on individual species are not well understood, much less ecosystems. The initial physical impacts section of 7 provides no quantitative estimates. Provide more evidence for this claim, or otherwise extend the discussion on the state of knowledge of biodiversity impacts.
> 
> No attempt is done to synthesize the available knowledge in the various sections. Instead, results from each study are reported, and readers cannot evaluate the best evidence available. Add a synthesis paragraph to each subsection (physical impacts, economic impacts, adaptation) which reports the state of knowledge (quantitatively where possible), generally with multiple supporting citations for each statement, rather than having the information organized by study.
> 
> Carefully evaluate the references. A “Rhode et al. 2021” reference is included in the text of Section 3, but not in the references (maybe they mean Rode, also not included in the references). Burke et al. 2015 is included in the text of section 5 but not its references, and the references of section 10 but not its text. Hsiang et al. 2013 is included in the references of section 3 but not the text.
> D1.2	Co-creation protocol for ACCREU	submitted
> 
> Accepted  	The review of relevant literature appears to be excellent. A methodology for reviewing the literature would help make it more broadly usable.
> 
> The stakeholder protocol is missing clear statements on the outcomes expected from stakeholders and how these will be used in the project. What depends upon the stakeholders? Are there specific questions will be asked of them, and how will their answers shape the project? How is the interaction between the stakeholder process and each work package structured? In the absence of this information, the stakeholder groups can end up just being a sounding board, and while that can provide useful input for the project, it falls short of co-production.
> 
> It is not clear how the emergent co-creation process will be used, and how it interacts with the bounded co-creation process.
> D1.3	Report on research agenda and participatory scenarios	submitted
> 
> Request for revision 	Although the process behind this deliverable is sensible, the reported material raises a number of questions. The request for revision is not only seeking additional information, but reflects the need for better integration with stakeholders interests. 
> 
> Many relevant questions are classified as « Maybe ». Please clarify how it will be decided if these will actually be studied.
> 
> Several questions are refused with no explanation, including questions of primary importance (e.g., the two under 2.2.3). Please clarify on what basis are these are refused.
> 
> Provide information for the partners column entries which are generally missing for the tables in 2.2.3.
> 
> There is one rejected question marked as high-priority by stakeholders, and 9 marked « Maybe », while many research questions not marked as priorities for stakeholders have been selected by ACCREU. Presumably, more of the high-priority questions could be addressed if partner questions were not prioritized. In most cases, no justification is given for these decisions to not follow stakeholder priorities. Since ACCREU is intended to be co-created, deviations from stakeholders interests need to be justified.
> 
> The section on participatory scenarios is underdeveloped. The decision to consider higher and lower challenges of adaptation needs to be quantified, presumably in a way that is distinct from the higher and lower challenges of adaptation scenarios already in the unused SSP scenario framework.
> D2.1	Impacts on infrastructure and built environment	Submitted
>  
> Accepted	Despite some concerns, this deliverable provides important updates around flood risk for the EU.
> 
> The models appear to not include transportation challenges from flooding, technological advancement in flood protection, and non-technological costs to adaptation. These should be discussed.
> 
> As modelling resolution increases (e.g., GLOFRIS modelled at NUTS3), the lack of transportation interconnections that can be disrupted becomes a greater problem. This should be quantified.
> 
> The DoA states that GLOFRIS will be updated to ACCREU scenarios, but this deliverable states that GLOFRIS is modelled under CMIP5.
> 
> The DoA specifies improvements to the DIVA and LISFLOOD models, but these are not described here (except for NBS which will be added to DIVA under T2.4). In particular, the deeper dive into smaller coastal units for DIVA and the rail network extension for LISFLOOD, appears to be missing.
> D2.2	Impacts on food, energy, and water	submitted
> 
> Request for revision 	This deliverable provides results from a powerful integration of models for land use and crops, and new innnovations to understand energy impacts. However, several points require revisiting.
> 
> The analysis depends upon “climate shifters” or “climate shifts”, which are long-run averages of parameters of interest. It is not clear at what stage in the processing the averageing takes place. In some cases, these appear to be averages of the outputs of biophysical models (e.g., pg. 28 refers to crop yields), presumably prior to input into GLOBIOM. This slows adaptation considerably. In other cases, an averaging is applied to climatic hazards (e.g., pg. 33 in reference to CDDs and HDDs). The resulting outcomes are the response to an average, rather than an average of the response, and this seems particularly inappropriate for energy demand. The implications of this choice should be evaluated.
> 
> The energy demand model regressions are cut-off, so it is not clear whether the fixed-effects model is called such because it is not a random effects model or because it includes certain econometric fixed-effects. In the absence of econometric fixed-effects, this regression model will ascribe all energy differences between countries (including, e.g., those from industrial use) to their climate. The model assumptions should be clarified.
> 
> The irrigated water requirement appears to replace the standard biophysical water requirement in EPIC-IIASA (irrigation to address water deficits) with an empirical relationship that bases water demand on yield. There are two problems with this:
> -	Irrigation is one of the most effective adaptation options for crops, and this appears to drop it.
> -	Yield is an outcome of water use, not the other way around, and this matters because high-yielding varieties are not always high water demand varieties (e.g., for high-yield drought-tolerant rice).
> The consequences of this change should be studied.
> The domestic water demand equation does not seem like it could explain the historical decreasing trend in water demand (as reported in the World Bank, not as shown in Figure 19), even as GDP (nearly equal to the product of population and GDP per capita raised to 0.85) has rapidly increased. In particular, the values of technological improvement appear too small to explain this. Provide a hindcast and explain the limitations of the approach.
> The energy demand adaptation results suggest that there are only two scenarios: Low (which is fairly implausible, since we see autonomous adoption of AC) and Reference/High. These do not help stakeholders in understanding plausible barriers to the adoption of energy efficient technologies. Better integrate this with the AC subsidy work in D2.3.
> Water available for irrigation produced by CWatM will account for river flows, while GLOBIOM will treat these values as simultaneously available everywhere along a river. The single-loop coupling between CWatM and GLOBIOM is likely to result in multiple uses of irrigation water. Please evaluate the extent of this problem.

A depreciated imports method is used in some sections of the deliverable but not others. Additionally, the AC adaptation policies considered here (subsidies) are more sophisticated than the ones used in D2.2. The two approaches should be merged, and the energy and health results are currently inconsistent.
> 
> The accepted practice is that health and productivity are most heavily influenced by high wet bulb temperatures (hot and humid conditions) not drought temperatures (hot and dry conditions). A comparison should be performed, and the differences explained.
> 
> The DoA states that the models would be run under the ACCREU SSP scenarios, but here RCP8.5 is used, and population projections come from a different source.
> 
> The income effect methodology does not account for the changing population, under migration and deaths, since it does not include longitudinal information. While this would normally not be an important effect, the analysis of income quantiles may make it so, because effects of heat waves on other portions of the population can change the studied populations in these quantiles. This should be evaluated.
> 
> Optimal temperatures for labour supply are presented in section 2.3, but this is an incorrect way to describe the peak of the temperature-labour supply curve. Presumably, the fixed effects also have temperature-correlated heterogeneity, and this would have to be studied to find optimal temperatures. These results should be reframed.
> 
> In section 3, a different type of optimum temperature is introduced. It is not clear whether this optimal temperature is held constant or allowed to vary under future temperature distributions, and this has implications for the assumed level of adaptation. The methodology should be clarified.
> 
> Chapter 5 describes a policy intervention, using a WTP elasticity from the Yangtze River Delta region of China. That estimate was based on empirical results of temperature shocks. The policy intervention described is based on subsidies, and WTP estimates from a subsidy experiment would be an appropriate way to evaluate likely uptake. Consider alternative WTP estimates that are more appropriate to the intervention. 
> 
> It seems that the authors in the cost-benefit analysis of the AC subsidy program are counting the subsidy as some kind of cost. Subsidies are mainly a transfer. Although there may be indirect costs associated with the subsidy, the main question is whether AC is underprovided, from the planner’s point of view. If the cost of an AC unit is less than the expected health benefits from that unit, 100% AC adoption is optimal. The calculations need to be justified or corrected.

> The analysis of West Nile virus has a serious missing variable problem. The key missing variable is the lagged presence of the virus. Since it is a disease, this kind of regression will describe the current state of spread, rather than true environmental suitability conditions. The analysis should be redone including lagged disease incidence as a predictor, or the problem should be handled another way.

> The consortium claims that the health impacts of flooding cannot be evaluated. As described above, their exclusion is not in-line with the risk mitigation strategy, and a systematic review should be conducted to draw appropriate estimates from the literature.
> D3.1	Conceptual and methodological framework for adaptation assessment	submitted
> Accepted 	This deliverable offers a comprehensive ontology for describing adaptation strategies, at the concrete and general levels. It does an effective job of highlighting key elements that might otherwise be overlooked, including indirect costs and benefits, uncertainties, path dependency, and distributional effects.
> 
> While the framework is extensive, it is possible that very few cases will allow for it to be fully filled out. Current and future risks tend to be poorly described for any particular adaptation option. Co-benefits and co-costs are difficult to quantify. Generally all of this work requires future projections of information that do not exist. 
> 
> While at the case study level, careful data collection can answer many current features of the solution, it is not clear how informative these are for generic adaptation options.
> D5.2	1st Updated CDEP	submitted
> Request for revision 	The description of dissemination activities is appropriately broad, but lacks key elements that could do much to improve impact.
> 
> The consortium’s communication potential, as a whole, depends upon leveraging different channels for different audiences. The tables in section 2 should be augmented with information about what kinds of audiences use the platforms, and how big those audiences are. Furthermore, there should be a plan to intelligently use that information.
> 
> ACCREU has a co-dissemination plan (D1.2), but this seems to lack a channel to the general public. In particular, there is no evidence of work in ACCREU to shape deliverables so that stakeholder representatives who themselves are interested in engaging with the general public have the materials they need. The general public dissemination activities fall far short of extension activities that could inform the general public. This is disappointing, since the public has much more reason for interest in these activities than businesses, which can move more easily.

> # Executive Summary
> 
> The ongoing project demonstrates continual progress towards its objectives, as outlined in the Description of Action (DoA). Key achievements include the completion of various work packages, notably making strides in providing high-resolution results essential for shaping effective adaptation strategies in the EU. The project relies on state-of-the-art methodologies and frameworks, exemplifying its strong scientific and technological underpinnings.
> 
> Noteworthy successes include robust literature reviews, the co-creation protocol, and advancements in conceptual frameworks for adaptation assessment. However, several deviations from the DoA are identified, requiring attention and corrective measures. These include a lack of integration between stakeholder activities and modeling efforts, underdeveloped pathways for stakeholder engagement, and insufficient dissemination of project outputs to stakeholders and the general public.
> 
> Furthermore, some deliverables encountered significant challenges, such as the need for revision of methodologies regarding stakeholder interaction, scenario development, and the integration of gender and open science dimensions. Of particular concern are the deviations in risk mitigation strategies, notably regarding health impacts of flooding and the integration of stakeholder perspectives into socio-economic scenarios.
> 
> While the project remains scientifically, technologically, and economically relevant, strengthening concrete actions for stakeholder engagement and refining deliverable methodologies can maximize the project's impact. Attention to these areas, along with addressing critical risks identified, will be crucial for ensuring timely and impactful completion of project objectives.
> 
> Overall, the project effectively contributes to the European Green Deal by providing substantial input into policies at multiple levels. Although there have been implementation challenges, the consortium has demonstrated a commitment to addressing these issues, guided by robust management strategies.

**assistant**:
> Absolutely! Here’s a structured recommendations section with action points based on the specified areas:
> 
> ---
> 
> # Recommendations
> 
> ## 1. Acceptance or Rejection of Resources
> - **Action Point 1:** Assess the funding provided to the Cyprus Institute (Deliverable D1.1) relative to its contributions to ensure alignment with work package responsibilities. Further justification may be required if resource utilization appears inconsistent with planned deliverables.
> 
> ## 2. Work Done and Corrective Actions
> - **Action Point 2:** Require the resubmission of Deliverable D1.1 to incorporate stakeholder feedback more effectively and to address scenario concerns raised (D1.3). Ensure integration of stakeholder inputs in future deliverables.
> - **Action Point 3:** Mandate revisions of Deliverables D2.2 and D2.3 to clarify modelling assumptions and enhance methodological rigor regarding climate impacts on health, adaptation strategies, and econometric controls.
> - **Action Point 4:** Enforce corrective actions related to Deliverable D2.4 on flood impacts and D3.1 on the conceptual framework for adaptation assessment, ensuring they provide clear pathways for adaptation strategies and stakeholder integration.
> 
> ## 3. Dissemination and Communication Activities
> - **Action Point 5:** Enhance dissemination strategies outlined in Deliverable D5.2 to ensure timely and effective delivery of policy briefs. Prompt the consortium to produce the remaining four briefs to meet Milestone 14.
> - **Action Point 6:** Develop a comprehensive communication plan that specifies target audiences for various dissemination channels, including traditional media and social platforms. Ensure that materials are available for stakeholder representatives to effectively engage the general public.
> - **Action Point 7:** Regularly monitor the availability of data and other outputs in adherence to open science principles, aiming for timely release aligned with publication schedules.
> 
> ## 4. Exploitation Plans and Related Activities
> - **Action Point 8:** Strengthen exploitation plans by defining clear pathways for translating research outputs into practical applications, especially for policy influences (e.g., Deliverable D5.2). Ensure stakeholder input shapes these pathways to maximize societal impact.
> - **Action Point 9:** Evaluate and update the intellectual property rights (IPR) strategy to safeguard research results with market potential. Ensure compliance aligns with the DoA and explore internationalization opportunities for broader impact.
> 
> ## 5. Other Aspects
> - **Action Point 10:** Reassess identified critical risks as outlined under "Critical Risks." Develop contingency plans for new and existing risks, ensuring regular updates in periodic reports to maintain project robustness and adaptability.
> - **Action Point 11:** Emphasize the importance of integrating gender analysis into project outputs to fully address the differential impacts of climate change. Ensure that relevant methodologies from the DoA are effectively executed in forthcoming deliverables.
