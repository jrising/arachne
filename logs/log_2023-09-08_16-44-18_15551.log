> Why does Thai iced tea have a orange color in it?
**assistant**:
> Thai iced tea gets its distinct orange color from the addition of a special ingredient called "Nam-dang," which is a type of food coloring commonly used in Thai cuisine. Nam-dang is typically made from anatto seed, which gives it a natural reddish-orange hue. When combined with the strong black tea and other ingredients in Thai iced tea, such as condensed milk and sugar, it creates the vibrant orange color that is characteristic of this delicious beverage.
