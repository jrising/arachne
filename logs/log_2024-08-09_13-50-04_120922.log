> how does IMT's building innocvation hubs support this portfolio of the Joyce Foudnatipn and why should they fund us? "Shifting to non-carbon sources of electric power is essential to eliminating global warming pollution – both directly by reducing the burning of fossil fuels in power plants, and indirectly as the transportation, industrial, building heating, and other sectors switch to electricity. There is positive technological, economic, and—in some Great Lakes states—policy momentum behind transitioning to carbon-free electric power. Yet, no states in our region are more than about halfway to achieving complete electric sector decarbonization, and some still get 80 or 90 percent of their electricity from fossil fuels. Joyce will support work on clean energy policy in Great Lakes states to secure long-term commitments to 100 percent carbon-free electricity.
> 
> Goal: To put Great Lakes states on a path to achieve just, equitable, carbon-free electric power systems by 2040.
> 
> Secure long-term commitments to transition to carbon-free electricity, including states establishing 100 percent carbon-free electricity goals and strategies, and states, utilities and their stakeholders embracing racial equity and energy justice as core elements of decarbonization plans
> Achieve full implementation of near-term state energy efficiency and renewable energy policies, with strategies tailored to fit the unique needs and opportunities in each state— focusing mostly on Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota, with smaller investments in Ohio and Wisconsin
> Support policy innovation to achieve complete, equitable decarbonization, closing the gap between the cumulative reductions that can be driven by the current generation of clean energy policies and 100 percent decarbonization"

> The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT)'s Building Innovation Hubs provide an excellent platform to support the Joyce Foundation's goal of achieving just, equitable, carbon-free electric power systems by 2040. Here's how:
> 
> 1. **Securing Long-term Commitments**: Building Innovation Hubs work with local governments and businesses to improve building energy performance and drive system efficiencies. This commitment to system-level changes aligns with Joyce Foundation's goal of achieving long-term commitments to decarbonize the power sector. By funding IMT, the Joyce Foundation will be supporting an organization that strives to reduce the carbon intensity of power from the ground up.
> 
> 2. **Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Policies**: The Hubs actively promote best practices for energy efficiency and encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources in the buildings sector. As the Joyce Foundation seeks to support the full implementation of near-term state energy efficiency and renewable energy policies, funding IMT’s initiatives will directly contribute to this objective.
> 
> 3. **Support Policy Innovation to Achieve Decarbonization**: Hubs engage with a diverse array of stakeholders to encourage innovative policy changes that pave the way for greater energy efficiency. By supporting this work, the Joyce Foundation will be underpinning efforts to achieve the policy innovation required for comprehensive decarbonization.
> 
> 4. **Promote Racial Equity and Energy Justice**: IMT has a deep commitment to promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion in all its operations. They recognize the disparate effects of climate change on marginalized communities, and work to ensure that climate action is both equitable and just. This aligns with Joyce Foundation's pursuit of racial equity and energy justice in decarbonization plans.
> 
> Funding IMT's Building Innovation Hubs means investing in tangible, grassroots efforts that are essential to accelerating the clean energy transition while ensuring it is fair and equitable. Hence, It will enable the Joyce Foundation to see direct impacts towards the realization of the sustainable, social equity goals that form its mission.
