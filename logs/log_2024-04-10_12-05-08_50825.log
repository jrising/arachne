> What does an economist mean when they call changes "non-marginal"? I think they mean more than just "not small", but rather that there's nonlinear change-- maybe discontinuous change?
**assistant**:
> When economists refer to changes as "non-marginal", it often implies more significant shifts than just "not small" changes. In economics, a marginal change usually means a small, incremental adjustment to an existing set of conditions. It assumes that the existing conditions are relatively stable or in equilibrium and that a small step away will not topple the entire system.

> In contrast, "non-marginal" changes can imply a departure from this assumption of stability and continuity. These can include nonlinear, discontinuous, or abrupt changes that have the potential to fundamentally disrupt the existing equilibrium or underlying systems.

> Such non-marginal changes may even cause shifts into new equilibria or trigger feedback loops that aren't apparent in a marginal change analysis. It's not just that these changes are larger; they might also involve different forces or mechanisms entirely. One might think about climate tipping points as an example of such changes in a different context.
