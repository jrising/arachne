**user**:
> I'm finishing a hand written addendum to my Christmas letter for someone who loves puzzles and puns, writing "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and ...", and I want to end with an anagram of a pun. Do you have suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Sure, I love the idea of an anagram pun to close out your note. You can use a simple, well-known phrase and then anagram it. 
> 
> For instance: 
> 
> "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and... **A dimly sung star: try grand mussels!**"
> 
> This is an anagram for "May your struggles turn into grand successes."
> 
> You can guide your friend to find out the original phrase, making it a fun puzzle for them to solve. I hope they will enjoy it!
