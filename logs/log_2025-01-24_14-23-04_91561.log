> I am writing a grant proposal. The grant proposal describes a set of work programs and tasks, as follows:
> ===
> Work Programmes
> 
> 
> 
> 
> WP1: Scenario development
> WP1 consists of two related sets of scenarios: Climate and socioeconomic scenarios, used to project impacts, and risk case study scenarios, used as potential financial stress tests.
> 
> Task 1.1: Develop projection scenarios: Global warming levels are key markers to understand risks, but are not sufficient to project climate risks. Future climate impacts depend upon future socioeconomics, including income levels and inequality, population density, and past adaptation decisions, as well as the rate of warming and the pattern of warming domestically and internationally. This task lays out a set of scenarios, backed by broad narratives, and conforming to 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C global warming levels, and an AMOC scenario. These will roughly follow SSP3-7.0 in years 2040, 2060, and 2080.
> Future work will distinguish scenarios under high and low growth or international convergence, and represent other features of tail climatic risk, including the Labrador-Irminger Seas Convection tipping point and rapid sea-level rise.
> 
> Task 1.2: Case study scenario identification: In this project, case studies that describe potential macroeconomic and financial stress will be derived from a thorough exploration of the space of bottom-up (WP2) and top-down (WP3) risks. We will identify compound events in the projections, across the range of uncertainty and variability. Case studies will combine chronic shifts in climate with unexpected shocks to particular sectors, and explore how these propagate through the economic system, mirroring the approach in Ranger et al. (2024)1. These will be co-designed in consultation with HMT. Potential case studies will consider (1) agricultural failures leading to price spikes and inflation; (2) a heat wave driving spiraling hospital costs; and (3) a flooding event which results in infrastructure disruption. This task will translate quantitative information into narratives, while Task 4.1 will translate narratives back into quantitative scenarios.
> 
> 
> 
> Future work will explicitly represent cascading impacts through quantitative modeling and engage a larger body of stakeholders in the co-design process.
> 
> WP2: Expanding bottom-up financial risks
> 
> WP2 will improve upon the process developed for Rising et al. (2022)2, where results from detailed models are (a) translated into emulators using each model’s underlying climate assumptions, (b) producing damage functions for UK regions according to the underlying models, and then (c) downscaled to high-resolution administrative units across the UK. The key innovation will consist of incorporating adaptation benefits and costs, drawn from multiple sources.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Task 2.1: Collect channel-specific model results. Draw upon new literature and collaboration with experts across the UK to develop a robust set of detailed model results. Drawing upon the work of the ACCREU project and the Climate Impact Lab, we will also collect results on the costs and benefits of (1) autonomous adaptation and income-driven reductions in vulnerability and (2) policy-driven adaptation investment.

> Task 2.2: Calibrate regional damage functions: Using the approach in Rising et al. (2022), we will fit emulators to the results from Task 2.1. In addition, the relationships between adaptation costs and reductions in vulnerability will be represented as elasticities, allowing us to project damages under any level of social adaptation costs.
> Future work will separately model different types of investments, rather than considering a single aggregate adaptation cost relationship, and account for interdependencies that adaptation approaches have across multiple risks.
> 
> Task 2.3: Projection of domestic damages and financial risks: Domestic damages will be projected under the scenarios from Task 1.1 at high resolution across the UK. These will be related to financial risks, in collaboration with OBR. The focus of the financial risks will be on risks to financial stability and the tax base for the UK government.
> Future work will expand the understanding of financial risks to include insurance and business-side risk.
> 
> WP3: Incorporating adaptation into top-down risks
> Econometric studies have greatly increased our understanding of the impact temperatures and other weather variables have on GDP growth. NGFS currently uses one of these results, from Kotz et al. (2024), to describe financial risks. However, the NGFS approach misses important evidence. (a) The number of studies have explored this relationship is rapidly increasing with very different assumptions, and we will use a meta-analysis approach, developed by Rising & Tahmid (WP), to develop a best-estimate of top-down risks. (b) A number of studies show that impacts to GDP growth are persistent beyond the lower-bound used in Kotz et al., and we will model the uncertainty around these explicitly. (c) Estimates in this literature do not include risks related to sea-level rise, which we will add on. (d) These estimates structurally exclude effects from international interactions, which we will incorporate using a trade model (possibly also NiGEM).
> 
> Task 3.1: Model macro-econometric growth losses: While Rising & Tahmid (WP)5 study the effects of macroeconomic losses from 9 models in this historical period, we will project these damages into the future using the scenarios from Task 1.1, across all countries.
> Future work will incorporate information from expert elicitation of damages, from Howard & Sterner (2017) and Moore et al. (2024), and globally-correlated losses from Bilal & Känzig (2024).
> 
> Task 3.2: Meta-analysis of macro-econometric results: The meta-analysis will synthesize information from the models studied in Task 3.1 to produce a best-estimate of future GDP losses. This approach uses machine learning as developed in Rising & Tahmid (WP)5, and translates draws upon the different results from different study approaches to construct losses that are robustly likely to be estimated from a gold-standard approach.
> Future work would incorporate “error term” information to explore the variability around impacts, rather than just the expected loss level.
> 
> Task 3.3: Projection of foreign damages: Using the best estimate from Task 3.2, we will project damages into the future accounting for uncertainty. These will then be input into the NiGEM model to understand how trade will result in risk spillovers for the UK.
> Future work will use a empirically-estimated dynamic vulnerability approach, developed for the PAGE integrated assessment model, to incorporate adaptation into GDP growth effects.
> 
> WP4: Macroeconomic framework integration
> WP4 will combine information from WP2 and WP3 and translate it into inputs appropriate for the NiGEM model, following the approach used in Ranger et al. (2024)1. This is conceived as an iteration with WP1 and a collaboration with NIESR.
> 
> Task 4.1: Elaborate case study scenarios: After case studies have been identified and described across the space of potential risks in Task 1.2, this task will translate those risks into quantitative impacts for the NiGEM macroeconomic model. This will again use the results from WP2 and WP3 (as in Task 1.2), but draw specifically from results that correspond to the narratives.
> Future work will perform an iterative modeling process, incorporating cascading risk information, whereby the narratives and quantitative representations are developed through repeated stakeholder engagement.
> 
> Task 4.2: Analyse NiGEM results: The results from NiGEM will further inform the narrative process in WP1, and highlight avenues for improvement. The key outcome of the NiGEM integration under this task is a clearer understanding of financial and macroeconomic risks resulting from the narratives.
> Future work will expand the range of scenarios input into the NiGEM model to improve the tool development process in Task 5.1.
> 
> WP5: Adaptation policy development
> WP5 will translate results from WPs 2, 3, and 4 into an easy-to-use, flexible tool for HMT. The main goals of this tool are (1) the ability to quickly explore new scenarios of domestic and trade-related risks; (2) the ability to propose and analyse adaptation investment plans; and (3) the production of outputs that can be input into models like NiGEM for further analysis.
> 
> Task 5.1: Co-develop a flexible tool: The flexible tool will take the form of a sophisticated spreadsheet, incorporating @RISK Monte Carlo simulations. It would include (1) the projection scenarios produced in WP1, with the ability to adjust their assumptions; (2) the emulated relationships produced in WP2 for multiple bottom-up risks; (3) the trade spillover risks produced by incorporating top-down risks from WP2 into macroeconomic modeling under WP4. It would also include options to design sophisticated adaptation scenarios, consisting of channel-specific investments. The process for updating risk relationships and adding new ones will be simple and clearly documented. The flexible tool would produce tables and figures, as well as outputs designed to be used with mapping tools and NiGEM. The tool would be co-designed with HMT to ensure that it meets its needs now and in the future.
> Future work will use a custom-calibrated AI to translate narrative scenarios into quantitative inputs appropriate for exploration within the tool.
> 
> Task 5.2: Analyse adaptation policies: Using the tool, a number of adaptation policies will be explored that aim to help the UK government maximize the returns from investments in adaptation policy. This task would explore a range of policies to identify the maximum benefit-cost ratio, and to understand where vulnerable groups can be best supported by existing adaptation options and where new adaptation options are needed.
> Future work will develop explicitly optimise across the adaptation options included in the flexible tool under multiple budget constraints, to provide clearer policy advice.

> The next section of the proposal is to produce KPIs. Here's the description from the funder:
> KPIs (please also reflect in KPI template): What does success look like? Specifically, what are the key performance indicators or outcomes for this proposal so we can know whether the work was achieved? 
> 
> However, I think what I want to do is mainly produce a set of "Objectives", based on the tasks. Can you write up a draft of this next section?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Creating a set of objectives that align with the tasks outlined in your work programs will provide a clear framework for measuring success. Here's a draft that you can use and adjust as needed:
> 
> ---

**user**:
> This seems a bit too much repeating the information from the WP section. Maybe I can produce some more general objectives, and then use a table to relate them to specific tasks?
> 
> Here are a description of the objectives from a scoping document produced by HMT:
> 3. Research questions and objectives
> 
> There are three core questions which HMT (and the OBR) would like to be in a position to answer:
> a)	What are UK macroeconomic impacts of climate change, including international spillovers/imported risk (addressing the limitations of NGFS), and accounting for autonomous adaptation and its costs?
> b)	What are the fiscal impacts associated with these damage and adaptation costs (updating the OBR FRS24, which relied on NGFS for inputs)?
> c)	Across a suite of key adaptation options, what are fiscal and socioeconomic costs associated with various levels of risk reduction?
> d)	How can funding best distributed across adaptation options to achieve risk reduction goals?
> 
> We are looking for expertise in particular on a) and c), with an initial focus on a). If needed, we can scope b) out and cover that within HMT/OBR.
> 
> The objectives are then:
> 1.	Shape HMT’s understanding and response to climate risk, including our approach to managing economic and fiscal risk and our international and financial stability work (questions a-c, with a focus on a). 
> 1.1.	Develop outputs on macroeconomic impacts that we can use as part of our core narrative across HMT and for Ministers, as well as the basis for our ongoing work in this space.
> 1.2.	Set out an economic baseline which includes climate damage for use as a reference point for framing our work on economic growth, rather than the de facto ‘no climate’ baseline.
> 2.	Ensure our quantification of the fiscal risks is based on the best evidence that we have no major gaps on transmission channels.
> 3.	Ensure spending decisions on climate adaptation are based on the best possible evidence, and the benefits can be traced back to an assessment of UK climate damages.
> 4.	Support timely decision-making as part of an ongoing programme of work, by designing the approach to include new evidence as and when this is available, including 2026 CCRA4 outputs on adaptation, and developing open-source tools.
> 5.	Support other countries to undertake similar work, by developing open-source tools and sharing insights.
> 
> 4. Outputs
> 
> The critical piece for us is that the modelling tools and assumptions are fully transparent and well documented, including detailed outputs in spreadsheet format (interim sectoral results and macroeconomic outputs) which can be shared. 
> 
> Ideally, we would like to be able to run the macroeconomic model in-house, as would the OBR, and develop tools that can be updated with better evidence as and when (including CCRA4 outputs for example, or anything coming out of OECD and IMF modelling on the international side). Being able to run models in-house also increases the likelihood that these will have a more significant policy impact and become embedded in day-to-day thinking.
> 
> Can you try to produce some somewhat distinct objectives and a table to relate them to the tasks?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are a set of more general objectives based on your provided information, followed by a table that correlates these objectives to the specific tasks outlined in your work programs.
