**assistant**:
> Sure, I can suggest a simple and fast vegetarian recipe: A Stir-Fry Vegetables with Tofu in Soy Sauce. This dish is packed with nutrients and is an excellent choice for a quick dinner. It serves 4 and takes around 30 minutes to prepare and cook.
> 
> **Ingredients:**
> 
> - 2 tablespoons olive oil
> - 1 block (14 oz) of tofu, cubed for a complete protein source
> - 1 large bell pepper (you can use any color), sliced
> - 2 medium carrots, thinly sliced on the diagonal
> - 4 celery stalks, thinly sliced on the diagonal
> - 1 small onion, sliced
> - Salt and pepper to taste
> 
> **For the stir-fry sauce:**
> 
> - 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
> - 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
> - 1 tablespoon cornstarch
> - 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup
> - 1-2 cloves garlic, minced
> - A pinch of crushed red pepper flakes if you like heat (optional)
> 
> **Steps:**
> 
> 1. First, prepare the tofu. Drain it and press it to squeeze out as much water as possible. Then, cut it into cubes.
> 
> 2. As the tofu drains, prepare the stir-fry sauce. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, cornstarch, honey (or maple syrup), minced garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using). Set it aside.
> 
> 3. Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes and cook them until they're golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Once they're browned, remove them from the pan and set them aside.
> 
> 4. Add the second tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Then, add the onion, sliced bell pepper, carrots, and celery to the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender.
> 
> 5. Return the tofu to the pan. Stir in the sauce, making sure all the vegetables and tofu are well-coated.
> 
> 6. Cook for another minute or two, until the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
> 
> 7. Serve the stir-fry over rice or noodles, if desired.
> 
> Enjoy your meal! This stir-fry is a great way to get a healthy dose of vegetables and protein in one dish. Plus, the sauce adds lots of flavor without being overly sweet or salty.
