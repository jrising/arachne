**assistant**:
> To suppress the debugging output from `imaplib`, you can disable debugging by setting the debug level to 0. Here is how you can modify your code to hide all that text:
> 
> ```python
> import imaplib
> 
> # Disable IMAP debug output
> imaplib.Debug = 0
> 
> # connect to the server
> mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')
> 
> # login to your account
> mail.login('your_email@gmail.com', 'your_password')
> 
> # now you can proceed with the rest of your IMAP operations
> mail.select('inbox')
> 
> # Add your IMAP operations here
> 
> # Don't forget to logout when you're done
> mail.logout()
> ```
> 
> Setting `imaplib.Debug = 0` disables the debug output to `stdout`. If you want to re-enable it later for debugging purposes, you can just set it back to a higher value (`imaplib.Debug = 1` or more) as needed.
