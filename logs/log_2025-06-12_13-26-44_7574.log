> Where can I make a reddit-style upvoting system for a collective online mechanism for people to work vote and propose alternatives on the vision statement that I'm trying to help people collaborate around?
**assistant**:
> Creating a Reddit-style upvoting system for collaborative decision-making and idea proposal can be done with several platforms and tools. Here are a few suggestions:
> 
> 1. **Loomio**: Loomio is a decision-making platform designed for collaborative discussion and consensus building. It may not have a traditional upvote/downvote system, but it focuses on reaching agreements through informed discussions.
> 
> 2. **DemocracyOS**: An open-source platform designed to foster democratic participation, allowing users to discuss, propose, and vote on ideas and solutions. It can be customized to include upvoting and downvoting functionalities.
> 
> 3. **Pol.is**: A tool for gathering opinions and clustering similar ones, which can help visualize consensus and dissent. Although it isn't exactly an upvote system, it allows participants to express agreement or disagreement, and it maps the relationships between opinions.
> 
> 4. **Kialo**: A discussion platform that allows for structured debates and collaborative reasoning. Users can upvote and downvote arguments, helping highlight popular or well-reasoned ideas.
> 
> 5. **Discourse**: An open-source discussion platform that supports forums with voting systems. You might need to use plugins or customizations to replicate a true upvote/downvote system.
> 
> 6. **Google Forms + Google Sheets**: For a more DIY approach, you could create a Google Form for submitting ideas and use Google Sheets to handle the voting data. This requires some manual work but gives you a lot of flexibility in designing the system.
> 
> Consider your technical skills, the scale of your project, and whether you prefer an open-source or a commercial solution when choosing a platform. If you need more customized functionality, you might also think about building a simple web app using frameworks like Django (Python) or Ruby on Rails.

> Which of these have upvoted things "float to the top", like Reddit?
**assistant**:
> For platforms that have a feature for upvoted items to "float to the top" like Reddit, consider the following:
> 
> 1. **DemocracyOS**: This platform allows users to propose ideas and vote on them, with the most popular ideas rising to the top, making them easier for everyone to see.
> 
> 2. **Kialo**: This structured debate platform allows users to upvote arguments and counterarguments, effectively making the best-supported ideas more prominent through their voting mechanism.
> 
> 3. **Discourse**: With the right plugins, Discourse can be configured to allow for upvoting and sorting discussions based on popularity, helping to highlight popular topics and ideas.
> 
> 4. **Loomio**: While it focuses on consensus decision-making, the most supported proposals can be prioritized in discussions, although it may not be as direct as traditional upvote systems.
> 
> 5. **Reddit itself**: If you're looking for a very straightforward Reddit-like experience, you could create a dedicated subreddit for your collaborative effort, allowing users to propose ideas and vote directly.
> 
> These platforms facilitate a voting system that prioritizes popular contributions, so users can easily find the most relevant and supported proposals.
