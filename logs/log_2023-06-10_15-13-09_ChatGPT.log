> I have a 36 month old and a 9 month old. I want to move the younger one out of our bedroom to share a room with the older one. My question is, how do I manage bedtime with the two of them. The older's bedtime routine involves books and songs. The younger's will involve a bottle feed.
**assistant**:
> Transitioning your younger child to share a room with their older sibling can be a process that needs some careful planning to make sure it goes smoothly. Here are some steps you could consider to help manage bedtime routines:
> 
> 1. **Staggered Bedtimes:** You could start by setting staggered bedtimes for both of them. Generally, the younger child might need to go to sleep earlier than the older one. Feed and put the baby to bed first, and once they're asleep, you can start with the older one's bedtime routine. Make sure to keep the bedtime routine for your older child calm and quiet to avoid waking the younger one.
> 
> 2. **Include the Older Child in the Routine:** Make your older child feel included in the younger sibling's bedtime routine. For instance, they could help get the bottle ready or select a lullaby to play softly. This helps foster a bond between the siblings and can make the older child feel important and responsible.
> 
> 3. **Synchronize Bedtime Routines:** Over time, you may wish to slowly align the bedtime routines. Start the routine for both at the same time. You could read a story that both enjoy while feeding the younger one their bottle. Then, after the story and the bottle, it could be time for a quiet song before lights out.
> 
> 4. **Create a Calming Environment:** Make sure the room has a soothing and calming atmosphere conducive to sleep. This includes dimmed lights, comfortable temperature, and minimal noise.
> 
> 5. **Prepare for Night Waking:** There will be times when one child wakes up in the middle of the night and might wake the other. It's important to set expectations with the older child that this may happen and that it's okay. Teach them to comfort their sibling or call you rather than trying to play or get upset.
> 
> 6. **Communicate:** This will be a big change for your older child, so make sure to talk with them about it. Let them know what to expect, and listen to their concerns or questions. It's important they feel heard and included in the process.
> 
> Remember that every child is unique, and you may need to adjust these suggestions to best fit your children's needs and personalities. Patience, flexibility, and consistency will be key in this transition.

> Should a 9 month old be able to sleep through the night? Ours currently nurses in the middle of the night. How can we do sleep training with them in the same room?
**assistant**:
> By around 6 months of age, many infants can sleep through the night without needing a nighttime feeding, but this varies greatly from child to child. Some babies will still require a night feeding at 9 months, particularly if they're breastfed. However, if your pediatrician feels your child is growing and developing well, it might be possible to gradually eliminate night feedings.
> 
> Sleep training in the same room can be challenging, but it's definitely doable. Here's a possible approach:
> 
> **Gradual Night Weaning:**
> 
> 1. *Reduce the amount:* Gradually reduce the amount of milk your baby is getting during their nighttime feedings. If you're bottle-feeding, you can do this by decreasing the amount of milk in the bottle. If you're breastfeeding, you can try nursing for a shorter period.
> 
> 2. *Extend the time between feedings:* Another approach is to gradually extend the time between nighttime feedings. If your baby is used to eating every 3 hours, for example, you could try waiting 3 and a half hours before feeding them. Then, after a few days, you could extend it to 4 hours, and so on.
> 
> **Sleep Training:**
> 
> Sleep training methods vary widely, but they generally involve helping your baby learn to self-soothe and fall back asleep on their own. Common methods include:
> 
> 1. *Ferber method:* Also known as "gradual extinction," this involves checking on your baby at increasingly longer intervals until they fall asleep. You begin with short intervals (a couple of minutes) and gradually increase them over several nights.
> 
> 2. *Chair method:* This involves sitting in a chair next to your baby's crib until they fall asleep, and then gradually moving the chair further away over several nights until you're out of the room.
> 
> 3. *Pick up/Put down method:* This method involves picking up your baby when they cry, comforting them until they're calm, and then putting them back in their crib while they're still awake.
> 
> **Room-Sharing Tips:**
> 
> When sleep training with a sibling in the room, you might want to consider:
> 
> 1. *Temporary Separation:* If possible, you might want to temporarily move the older child out of the room during the first few nights of sleep training. This could mean having a fun "sleepover" in another room.
> 
> 2. *White Noise:* Use a white noise machine to help mask the sounds of the baby stirring or crying.
> 
> 3. *Communicate:* Talk to the older sibling about what's happening and reassure them that their sibling is okay. Encourage them to stay in bed even if the baby cries.
> 
> Remember to consult with your pediatrician before starting any sort of sleep training or night weaning process to ensure that it is appropriate for your child's age, weight, and overall health.
