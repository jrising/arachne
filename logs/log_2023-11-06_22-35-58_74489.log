> Estimating Current Climate Losses - Project Proposal
> PI: James Rising, University of Delaware
> 
> Context: The planet has already warmed by 1.34 Â°C [1.2 - 1.5 Â°C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. Under one expert review of global damages, this suggests that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion. In poor, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be significantly greater.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> Deliverable: This project will develop best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome will be percent reductions in GDP per capita and percent reductions in capital wealth, in 2023, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP per capita is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels. A recent estimate of GDP losses, combining three of these results and produced by the PI for a previous ECF-funded project on the cost of climate change in the UK, is shown below.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses will provide new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change. The losses would also be reported as a global average and for various regional and country groups (e.g., LLMICs, G77, Sub-Saharan Africa).
> 
> Annually varying loss estimates will underlie these results, which will reflect greater losses in years with heat waves and in later years as climate change accelerates. We will develop short case studies from the EU and LLMICs will compare these GDP losses to other reported impacts of recent heat waves.
> 
> The estimates will be produced as part of a short report made initially available to the sponsors Nov. 1, 2023, and for release during COP 28. The work will then be prepared for academic publication.
> 
> Unique contribution: To produce these results, we bring together existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate (see Table under Points of Methodology). Over the past decade, this literature has proposed many different approaches to understanding the effect of climate on GDP, including investigations of the differential vulnerability of poor countries, the role of persistent losses to growth, and the potential of adaptation. Current attempts to synthesise this literature are limited to simply averaging the results. Using a machine learning model, calibrated to the results from this literature, we will produce an estimate that reflects the most advanced features of all of these papers.

No single existing estimate captures the full range of relevant factors that has been identified in the literature.
> 
> We will use ERA5 reanalysis weather data to produce historical projections of climate effects, available 1940 - present. To construct the counterfactual without climate change, we will resample values from the baseline period (1940 - 1960). A key question in the literature is the extent to which impacts put countries on a permanently lower growth trajectory. This was carefully analysed in a previous paper of the PIâ€™s, and the resulting uncertain distribution of persistence will be used here.
> 
> Drawing upon both the headline estimates and additional results in the paper will provide evidence across the space of possible combinations of model elements. A random forest model will then be fit to these models, informed by meta-data about each. Finally, the random forest will be queried for damages from a model that simultaneously represents high-quality features in all model categories.
> 
> As an additional line of evidence, we will use the previously mentioned Howard & Sterner meta-analysis of damage results derived from expert elicitation. This provides both a measure of catastrophic risk, which will be applied uniformly across the globe, and an estimate of non-catastrophic global losses, which can be used as a loose constraint on the sum of the machine learning results.

> These GDP values, along with additional information from the World Bank, will be used to calibrate country-specific Solow growth models, and this will be used to infer the loss to the total capital base that these GDP results imply.
> ---
> 
> I am now writing the results and findings section. The next part should discuss the time-series I have produced on GDP losses. Please include the following points:
> 
>  - Globally GDP losses have tracked temperatures. Since 1960, temperatures have risen nearly linearly by about 1 Â°C as population-weighted GDP has fallen 6.4% (see Figure #GLOBALTIME).
>  - Outcomes for individual countries vary widely, and individual years can be quite different (Figure #COUNTRYTIME). GDP in Russia has increased by 13% [10 - 17%] due to climate change, while GDP in Saudi Arabia has fallen by 13% [3 - 19%]. These results assume that fossil fuel extraction is unaffected by temperatures.
>  - The US and China have had similar experiences, and are both currently near the break-even point, with neither losses from high temperatures nor gains from milder winters.
**assistant**:
> # 4. Results and Findings
> 
> Our analysis of the relationship between climate change and GDP losses, built on a solid foundation of existing research and enriched with machine learning techniques, has produced compelling insights. The following sections shed light on these results.
> 
> ## 4.1 Global Trends in GDP Losses and Temperature Increase
> 
> Our study suggests a strong correlation between GDP losses attributable to climate change and rising temperatures. Since 1960, we have observed a nearly linear increase in global temperatures of 1Â°C, in pace with a corresponding reduction in global population-weighted GDP by approximately 6.4% (Figure #GLOBALTIME). The persistent year-by-year temperature increase underscores the pervasive influence of climate change.
> 
> Reliably translating these findings into economic outcomes, we have found that incremental increases in temperature have consistently mapped to escalating losses in GDPâ€”evidence of the profound, unfolding economic toll that climate change has exerted on economies worldwide.
> 
> ## 4.2 Variability Across Individual Countries 
> 
> Our geographic analysis of these trends, however, reveals marked disparities across territories. Climate change is not an indiscriminate phenomenon; its effects manifest divergently across different regions and in varying magnitudes, as seen in Figure #COUNTRYTIME.
> 
> A case in point is Russia, which has paradoxically seen a 13% increase in GDP [10 - 17%] attributable to climate change. However, these results are premised on the assumption that temperatures do not affect fossil fuel extraction, a significant component of Russia's economy. The milder winters experienced as a result of climate change may have catalyzed economic activities, leading to the counter-intuitive GDP increase.
> 
> Contrastingly, Saudi Arabia has endured a 13% [3 - 19%] drop in GDP owing to climate change, under the same assumption about fossil fuel extraction. Harsher temperatures could have adversely affected the country's other economic sectors, offsetting any advantages gained in oil extraction efficiency from warmer climes.
> 
> ## 4.3 Comparative Analysis of The US and China 
> 
> To throw into sharper relief the economic impacts of climate change, we examined its effects on the world's two biggest economies: the US and China. Coincidentally, both countries currently hover near the break-even point, revealing neither significant GDP losses from excessively high temperatures nor substantial gains from comparatively milder winters. 
> 
> It is worth noting that these situations might be transient. As global temperatures continue to inch upward, the subtle balance maintained by these nations could easily tip into the negative axis, leading to unprecedented economic strain.
> 
> Through these findings, several questions emerge: Are these dynamics sustainable? If not, when will the scale tilt from balance to imbalance? The sustainability and resilience of "break-even" economies amid escalating global warming will indubitably be focal points in future analyses. 
> 
> In the next section, we turn to the future trajectory of these patterns and the prospective implications for global sustainability.
**user**:
> The final section should discuss capital losses. Please include the following points:
> 
>  - Losses to GDP also cause capital investments to fall, which eventually drives down the stock of produced capital in a country.
>  - Here, we also see significant heterogeneity. High income countries have an estimated $549 billion less in produced capital than they would have without climate impacts, while the rest of the world has $2033 billion less (see #LEVELCHANGE).
>  - The effect on renewable capital is more muted because of two effects pushing in opposite directions. We model temperature as having a direct (generally negative) effect on the ability of the natural world to generate ecosystem services. At the same time, reductions in GDP also reduce the strain placed upon the natural world, allowing capital to grow. On net, these effects result in a loss of $339 billion in rich countries and $583 billion in the rest of the world, with a notable increase of $134 billion in renewable capital in low income countries.
>  - We do not model changes in human capital (education) or nonrenewable capital due to climate change.
**assistant**:
> ## 4.4 Capital Losses and the Erosion of Productive Capacity
> 
> The repercussions of climate change extend beyond immediate GDP losses; they also reverberate through capital investments, culminating in a decline in a country's total stock of produced capital. Consequently, our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in the magnitude of capital losses experienced across different income groups and geographic regions.
> 
> Broadly speaking, countries confronted with climate impacts suffer from diminished capital investments, exacerbating the erosion of their productive capacity over time. The extent of these capital losses carries critical implications for long-term economic resilience and the ability to sustain growth.
> 
> ## 4.5 Heterogeneity in Capital Losses
> 
> High-income countries have witnessed a substantial reduction in their produced capital, estimated at $549 billion less than they would have had in the absence of climate impacts (Figure #LEVELCHANGE). This figure underscores the significance of climate change as a formidable downward force on capital accumulation in economically advanced nations.
> 
> In contrast, the rest of the world, comprising low and middle-income countries, has experienced even more pronounced capital losses, totaling $2033 billion. The sheer magnitude of these impacts demonstrates the heightened vulnerability faced by these regions and further underscores the urgency to address climate change as an issue of not just economic stability but global equity as well.
> 
> ## 4.6 The Impact on Renewable Capital
> 
> Renewable capital, a vital component of sustainable development, is influenced by climate change dynamics in more nuanced ways. Our models consider two factors that simultaneously exert opposing influences on renewable capital.
> 
> Firstly, we model temperature as having a generally negative effect on the natural world's ability to generate ecosystem services, thus potentially tempering the growth of renewable capital. On the other hand, reductions in GDP resulting from climate change can alleviate strain on the natural world, engendering scope for capital growth.
> 
> When these effects are weighed, a net loss of $339 billion in rich countries and $583 billion in the rest of the world emerges for renewable capital (Figure #LEVELCHANGE). However, notably, low-income countries exhibit a counterintuitive trend, experiencing an increase of $134 billion in renewable capital. This indicates a unique opportunity for these countries to leverage renewable resources and foster sustainable development, even in the face of climate change challenges.
> 
> ## 4.7 Limitations of the Analysis
> 
> While our study comprehensively addresses the impact of climate change on GDP and produced capital, there are certain aspects beyond the purview of our analysis. Notably, changes
