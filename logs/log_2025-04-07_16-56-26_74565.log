**assistant**:
> The Kyoto Protocol controls several classes of fluorinated gases, which are potent greenhouse gases. These include:
> 
> 1. **Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs):** These are used primarily as refrigerants in air conditioning and refrigerating systems, in foam blowing, and as solvents.
> 
> 2. **Perfluorocarbons (PFCs):** Often used in the electronics and medical industries, PFCs are also released as byproducts in aluminum production.
> 
> 3. **Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF₆):** This gas is mainly used as an insulating gas in high-voltage electrical equipment.
> 
> These gases, while making up a smaller fraction of overall emissions compared to CO₂, have a much higher global warming potential, making their regulation critical under international climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol. Additionally, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol has further targeted the reduction of HFCs, reflecting a continued international effort to mitigate their impact on climate change.
