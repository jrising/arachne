> Community ClimateShift is a groundbreaking initiative designed to transform how communities and local governments work together to ensure that new building performance standards, or other decarbonization policies, implemented by cities and states contribute to a Just Transition and reflect community priorities. 
> 
> IMT’s Community Climate Shift achievements include:
> Building Community Climate Shift’s national movement infrastructure to appropriately support a range of partners, including local and state governments, community-based organizations (CBOs), and technical assistance providers, to equitably and efficiently collaborate.
> Developing and implementing a formal governance plan that centers community leadership.
> Supporting deep, place-based work in four communities and began outreach to nine more.
> Securing a $5M award from the U.S. Department of Energy to assist local and state governments as they build collaborative climate action plans with community partner
> A steering committee composed of environmental justice and community-based organizations now guides CCS’s resource allocation. The core values guiding this work are based on the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing, which include inclusivity, bottom-up organizing, and working together in solidarity and mutuality. We are committed to maintaining a collaborative governance and decision-making model that honors consensus building and authentic, accessible participation that results in informed outcomes toward community-driven solutions.

> IMT and its partners were selected for a $5M award to support community-centered policy and program creation using the principles of Community Climate Shift. This funding is through the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation opportunity, which is part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The purpose of the grant is to create relationships and shared goals between local governments and community members that produce equitable building performance policies and supporting programs. The funding supports technical assistance providers to manage this process and provide the necessary analysis, research, and facilitation to design and implement place-based equitable building decarbonization programs. As mentioned above in the application, this grant will allow us to support the following state and local governments: California; Chicago, IL; New Orleans, LA; Philadelphia, PA; Washington DC; Kansas City, MO; St. Louis, MO; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington State.

> 
> Community ClimateShift, driven by the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), is a state-of-the-art initiative that reengineers the way local governments and communities collaborate. Our goal is to ensure that the implementation of new building performance standards and other decarbonization policies by cities and states not only contribute to a Just Transition, but also mirror community concerns and aspirations. 
> 
> Our notable achievements under the Community Climate Shift project encompass:
> 
> - Establishing a robust nation-wide infrastructure to foster effective collaborations among a diverse range of partners - local and state governments, community-based organizations, technical assistance providers and more.
> - Crafting and realizing a comprehensive governance plan with a focal point on community leadership.
> - Undertaking in-depth work in four distinct communities while extending outreach to nine others.
> - Procuring a substantial $5M grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to support local and state governments in crafting collaborative climate action plans with community partners. 
> 
> Our approach is steered by a committee comprising environmental justice and community-based organizations, using the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing as a roadmap. These principles, which stress inclusivity, grassroots organizing, solidarity and mutuality, are the guiding beacon for our decision-making methodology. We aspire to foster an environment that encourages consensus building and promotes authentic, accessible participation leading to well-informed, community-driven solutions.

> Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation, a component of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), recognized the potential of our community-centered policy and program creation approach and awarded IMT and its partners a $5M grant. This resource will enable us to cultivate strong bonds and shared objectives between local governments and community members that lead to the development of equitable building performance policies and complementary programs. The grant will be used to avail technical assistance providers, thereby facilitating the necessary analysis, research and facilitation required to design and implement region-focused equitable building decarbonization programs. The regions to benefit from this grant include California; Chicago, IL; New Orleans, LA; Philadelphia, PA; Washington DC; Kansas City, MO; St. Louis, MO; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington State.
