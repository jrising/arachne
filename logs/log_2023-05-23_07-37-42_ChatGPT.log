> I have two plug adapters, each of which has two round pegs, but on one the pegs are thicker than the other. Where can I use them?
**assistant**:
> Plug adapters with two round pegs are common in Europe and parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. However, the thickness of the pegs can indeed differentiate where they can be used as different countries use different types of plug sockets.
> 
> 1. Thinner round pegs: This is typically Type C plug, often called the Europlug. It has two round pins which usually measure 4.0mm in diameter and are spaced 19mm apart. This plug is used widely in Europe, South America, and parts of Asia.
> 
> 2. Thicker round pegs: This is likely a Type E or F plug, commonly known as Schuko plug. It also has two round pins, but they typically measure 4.8mm in diameter. This plug is used in countries such as Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and others.
> 
> However, do note that there can be exceptions and variances even within countries. I would strongly advise checking a reliable travel adapter guide or consulting with the power company in the country you're visiting to ensure you have the correct adapter. It's also important to remember that adapters do not convert voltage or frequency, so check whether your device is compatible with the electrical system of the country you're visiting.

> Which should I use in Portugal?
**assistant**:
> In Portugal, the power plugs and sockets are of type F and C. Both types have two round pins, but the Type F is a bit thicker and often includes an earth clip or pin. The standard voltage is 230 V and the standard frequency is 50 Hz.

> 1. If your plug adapter has thinner round pegs (typically 4.0mm in diameter), it's a Type C plug. You can use this in Portugal.
> 
> 2. If your plug adapter has thicker round pegs (typically 4.8mm in diameter), it's a Type F plug. You can also use this in Portugal.
> 
> So, you can use either of your adapters in Portugal. However, remember to ensure that your devices can handle the 230 V voltage in Portugal. If not, you will need a voltage converter.
