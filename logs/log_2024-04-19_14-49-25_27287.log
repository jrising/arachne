> What is a standard linear interpolation function in python?
**assistant**:
> In Python, one of the simplest ways to perform standard linear interpolation is by using the `numpy.interp()` function. Here's a simple example:
> 
> ```python
> import numpy as np
> 
> # Define your known data points (x, y)
> x_known = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 5])
> y_known = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 5])
> 
> # Define points for which you want to interpolate
> x_new = np.array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4])
> 
> # Interpolate
> y_new = np.interp(x_new, x_known, y_known)
> 
> print(y_new)  # gives: array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.])
> ```
> This code illustrates linear interpolation in 1D. `np.interp()` interprets the `x_known` and `y_known` arrays as defining a function that it then uses to find values at `x_new`.
> 
> Interpolation functions get more complex for multi-dimensional data. For 2D or ND interpolation, the `scipy.interpolate` module provides several more advanced methods.
