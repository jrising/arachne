>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics
>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> My name is Nasrin Badrzadeh, I am a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering from Tarbiat Modares University. (one of the best Iranian universities). The project of my thesis was “Modeling and Assessment of Management Practices on Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Discharges into River Systems”. I am sending this email to inquire if you have any available funded Ph.D. positions.
> 
> I believe that my greatest contribution to water systems management will be achieved by obtaining a Ph.D. While recognizing that I am at an early stage of my education, I have already achieved the following accomplishments:
> 
> ·         Published a paper in Science of The Total Environment.
> 
> ·         Worked in Various Fields of Water Science Engineering as a junior water resource management expert at a consulting firm.
> 
> ·         Ranked  1st in the B.Sc. and 15th in the M.Sc. nationwide university entrance exam.
> 
> Furthermore, another research paper related to Optimizing Environmental Flow Regime and Water Quality in Rivers has been published to Environmental Monitoring and Assessment and water supply journal.
> 
> I was seeking a professor whose area of interest matches those of mine and, therefore, I found your recent research focus and projects appealing and of high suitability which enticed me to email you. I am confident that if you give me the opportunity, I will be a helpful addition to your lab. Attached is my CV which may help you find more about me. Please let me know if you need more information.

> I would appreciate your kind reply about the possibility of further communication.

> Dear James,

> After reviewing the email, Nasrin Badrzadeh is seeking a potential fully-funded Ph.D. position under your supervision. She has not explicitly expressed her program of interest. However, considering her background in Water Structure Engineering and interests in water systems and environmental management, it appears that she might be interested in either the Ph.D. in Marine Policy or the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics.
> 
> Nasrin has a track record in water resource management and has published papers related to water quality in rivers and nonpoint source pollution discharges into river systems. Whether she is more attracted to the policy or economics aspect would need to be clarified. 
> 
> Nasrin's email demonstrates clear interest in the research areas you focus on, especially given her experience in modeling and assessment of management practices on agricultural nonpoint source pollution discharges into river systems.
