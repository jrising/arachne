> Can you learn the IMT strategic plan for the communications and and development teams? "Position IMT as a national leader in bridging the priorities of frontline communities,
> governments, and the building industry
> o We will do this by having representatives of each IMT program speak at major
> industry conferences in each of these sectors and to influential reporters/media
> professionals who reach our core audiences. We will measure success based on
> anecdotal feedback, overall external presence during conference season and
> unsolicited media requests as well as earned media placements.
> 2. Deepen IMT’s connection to existing audiences and expand our influence to new
> audiences who can fund our work
> o We will do this by identifying and segmenting our audiences in order to tailor our
> communications to their values, goals, and preferences. We will craft messaging
> for each audience, and ensure staff understand and can use these strategies in
> their communications. We will measure success through digital engagement
> metrics, anecdotal feedback, surveys, and, when relevant, dollars raised.
> 3. Increase our capacity to tell human-centered stories about all of IMT’s work to all
> of our audiences
> ● We will do this by a) collaboratively proactively across teams and b) by training
> and supporting staff so we tell timely, compelling stories. Our goal is to produce
> at least one story-based deliverable per program per quarter.
> 4. Raise $$$ from governmental contracts, philanthropy and corporate donations
> o We will define a typology of funders aligned with our mission and approach, and
> effectively articulate our value to these audiences by training staff on how to do
> so. We will measure success through grant wins, relationship building, and total
> conversions from prospective to confirmed donors.

> 5. Assess the relevance and efficacy of our current brand. Determine alignment with

> identify opportunities to fund minor modifications or significant rebranding as needed.
> Communications Priorities
> 1. SHOW (external): Demonstrate pathways to equitable building decarbonization and
> building performance in alignment with our strategy plan for 2024-2027. We will do this
> by producing stories that amplify program and leadership priorities.
> 2. POSITION: IMT as a national leader in bridging the priorities of frontline communities,
> governments, and the building industry, so that they share power as they scale solutions
> that place high performing buildings at the center of an equitable, climate-resilient future.
> 3. STRENGTHEN: Deepen IMT’s connection to existing audiences as identified in our
> strategic plan.
> 4. ELEVATE: Raise IMT’s visibility (and that of priority sub-branded initiatives) as a trusted
> national leader so we can increase funding and better achieve our mission. Priority
> examples are:
> ● Increase corporate funding for IMT programs (membership)
> ● Increase philanthropic funding with new funders
> ● Present at influential conferences, including outside traditional energy efficiency
> events
> ● Increase our media coverage with nontechnical, widely read publications
> ● Participate in key federal grant opportunities
> ● Grow our social media presence in alignment with our priority audiences
> 5. MODEL EXCELLENCE (internal): Explore new and collaborative approaches across
> teams, that:
> ● Embody proactive strategies
> ● Increase our internal capacity to tell timely, compelling stories
> Commented [6]: What are the 'priorities' we should be
> producing stories around? Is it 'leadership' that we
> need to show or the 'strategic priorities' in our plan (ex.
> 'Act at the intersections', 'Design for the margins,
> benefit the whole'
> Commented [7R6]: We need to focus on what
> leadership deems a priority. These items are, ideally,
> already in the strategic plan. But sometimes things
> come up, and I want to be clear that Alex and Betsy will
> be clarifying the priorities. Here's a hypothetical
> example:
> Trump wins the 2024 election and IMT is suddenly
> targeted by a conservative activist group that is angry
> we are receiving GGRF funding (or for any reason) and
> pressuring DOE to cut us off financially. Suddenly
> Comms is pivoting our work to focus on stories that
> show we address whatever DOE's concerns are.
> 4
> Audiences
> When speaking publicly, IMT generally speaks about our work bridging the needs of three main audiences: government, community,
> and business. A more detailed list, below, adds other stakeholders, and also further segments these initial three groups. For

> Audience shifts for 2024-2027
> IMT audiences will mostly the same in the next three years. We will prioritize traditional
> audiences (government/utility staff, real estate providers, philanthropy) and continue to expand
> our work with community-based organizations.
> However, to achieve greater funding diversity and increase overall revenue, we must expand
> our external presence. In particular, we need new funders, new media relationships, and new
> digital strategies.
> New funders
> We anticipate a greater focus on corporate and individual giving, and on audiences who can
> participate in Hub and CEO membership programs. There are also numerous federal
> opportunities unique to this moment in time.
> For both the Hub and BPP, it would be helpful to have new and stronger relationships with
> banks and the financial institutions that can back building retrofits. The Greenhouse Gas
> Reduction Fund work may afford some new relationships.
> External visibility/media
> For external visibility, we want to move beyond narrow industry publications or conferences
> focused on energy efficiency so we can reach broader audiences. Sustainability, social equity,
> and clean energy topics have much broader appeal than energy efficient buildings.
> That said, BPS is an increasingly popular topic, which is very helpful for us. We need to

> on BPS as well as green leasing. We have also developed a reputation as energy code experts,
> and need to hold that reputation. We are not well known for our community engagement or
> utility work, so those are areas for growth.
> Digital presence
> We need to continue to invest in digital strategies that will help us rank higher in search results

**assistant**:
> Yes, I can learn and understand the IMT strategic plan for the communications and development teams as detailed. Here's a summary of key elements from the plan:
> 
> 1. **Position IMT as a national leader**: This involves having representatives from each IMT program speak at major industry conferences and to influential reporters/media professionals. Success will be measured by anecdotal feedback, overall external presence during conference season, unsolicited media requests, and earned media placements.
> 
> 2. **Deepen connections and expand influence**: This aims to identify and segment audiences to tailor communications accordingly, with success measured through digital engagement metrics, anecdotal feedback, surveys, and dollars raised.
> 
> 3. **Increase capacity to tell human-centered stories**: This involves proactive collaboration across teams and training/supporting staff to tell timely, compelling stories, with a goal of producing at least one story-based deliverable per program per quarter.
> 
> 4. **Raise funds from various sources**: This includes defining a typology of funders aligned with IMT's mission, training staff on effective articulation of IMT's value, and measuring success through grant wins, relationship building, and conversion of prospective to confirmed donors.
> 
> 5. **Assess the current brand**: Determine alignment with evolving work and strategic priorities, with a completion target of Q4 2024. This includes identifying opportunities for minor modifications or significant rebranding.
> 
> **Communications Priorities**:
> - Demonstrate pathways to equitable building decarbonization and performance, in alignment with the strategic plan.
> - Position IMT as a leader in bridging the priorities of frontline communities, governments, and the building industry.
> - Strengthen connection to existing audiences and elevate IMT's visibility to increase funding and achieve its mission.
> 
> **Audiences**:
> The strategic plan details specific audiences (such as community-based organizations, large real estate companies, financial institutions, government agencies, and more), desired actions from each, key IMT messaging, relevant IMT teams, planned engagement activities, and metrics for measuring success.
> 
> **Audience Shifts for 2024-2027**:
> Emphasizes maintaining focus on traditional audiences while expanding work with community-based organizations, seeking new funders, building new media relationships, and developing new digital strategies for greater funding diversity and overall revenue increase.
> 
> It's a comprehensive plan that leverages IMT's strengths, identifies areas for growth, and strives for a greater impact in bridging the gap between diverse stakeholders in the path toward sustainable building and community development.
