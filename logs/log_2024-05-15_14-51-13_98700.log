> About how quickly can a student read and respond to multiple choice questions, if there isn't additional work involved in answering them?
**assistant**:
> The time it takes for a student to read and respond to a multiple-choice question can depend on various factors such as the complexity of the question, the student's familiarity with the topic, reading speed, and decision-making time. On average, however, it is generally reasonable to expect that a student could read and respond to a straightforward multiple-choice question in about 1 to 2 minutes. For a more complex question requiring careful thought and consideration of each answer choice, the time might increase to 2 to 5 minutes.
