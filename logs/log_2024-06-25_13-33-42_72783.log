> I recently got a QNAP NAS, and I would like to mount if on my ubuntu server.  I noticed that it is only visible when I have ufw turned off, even though it's on my internal network. What do I need to do to access it?
**assistant**:
> It sounds like your QNAP NAS and your Ubuntu server aren't communicating due to firewall rules. To resolve this, you can configure UFW to allow the necessary traffic between your devices.
> 
> Hereâ€™s what you need to do:
> 
> 1. **Identify the NAS IP Address:**
>    Make sure you know the IP address of your QNAP NAS. You can usually find this in the settings of your NAS or by checking the DHCP table on your router.
> 
> 2. **Check Necessary Ports:**
>    Identify which ports your NAS uses. Common ports include:
>    - **NFS (Network File System):** 2049/tcp
>    - **SMB/CIFS (Samba):** 137/udp, 138/udp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp
> 
> 3. **Allow Traffic Through UFW:**
>    You can open these ports in UFW. Here are commands for common services:
> 
>    ```sh
>    sudo ufw allow from <NAS_IP> to any port 2049 proto tcp  # NFS
>    sudo ufw allow from <NAS_IP> to any port 137 proto udp   # SMB
>    sudo ufw allow from <NAS_IP> to any port 138 proto udp   # SMB
>    sudo ufw allow from <NAS_IP> to any port 139 proto tcp   # SMB
>    sudo ufw allow from <NAS_IP> to any port 445 proto tcp   # SMB
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Allow Complete Communication from NAS (optional):**
>    If you want to allow all traffic from your NAS for simplicity:
> 
>    ```sh
>    sudo ufw allow from <NAS_IP>
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Reload UFW:**
>    
>    After making these changes, reload UFW to apply the new rules:
> 
>    ```sh
>    sudo ufw reload
>    ```
> 
> 6. **Verify UFW Status:**
> 
>    You can check the status and the applied rules with:
> 
>    ```sh
>    sudo ufw status
>    ```
> 
> Once you've done these steps, try reconnecting your NAS to your Ubuntu server. You should now be able to mount your NAS without having to disable UFW.
> 
> ### Mounting Your QNAP NAS
> 
> To mount your NAS, you can add an entry in your `/etc/fstab` file or mount it manually via command line.
> 
> **Manual Mounting (for NFS):**
> 
> ```sh
> sudo mount -t nfs <NAS_IP>:/share/<your_shared_folder> /mnt/<mount_point>
> ```
> 
> **Manual Mounting (for SMB):**
> 
> ```sh
> sudo mount -t cifs -o username=<your_username>,password=<your_password> //NAS_IP/<your_shared_folder> /mnt/<mount_point>
> ```
> 
> Make sure you've created `/mnt/<mount_point>` beforehand with:
> 
> ```sh
> sudo mkdir -p /mnt/<mount_point>
> ```
> 
> **Auto-mount on Boot (in `/etc/fstab`):**
> 
> Add the following line to `/etc/fstab` for NFS:
> 
> ```sh
> <NAS_IP>:/share/<your_shared_folder> /mnt/<mount_point> nfs defaults 0 0
> ```
> 
> For SMB:
> 
> ```sh
> //<NAS_IP>/<your_shared_folder> /mnt/<mount_point> cifs username=<your_username>,password=<your_password>,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0
> ```
> 
> Replace placeholder values like `<NAS_IP>`, `<your_shared_folder>`, `<mount_point>`, `<your_username>`, and `<your_password>` with actual values specific to your environment.
> 
> I hope this helps get your QNAP NAS connected smoothly! If you encounter any troubles, feel free to ask for further assistance.
