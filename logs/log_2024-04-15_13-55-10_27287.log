> I want to construct a "barometer" of the health of the coastal economy in Delaware. In one part, I want to show frequently-updated (daily?) indices of risk to the coastal economy. What measures might be useful and where can I get the associated frequently-updated data
**assistant**:
> A "barometer" of the health of the coastal economy in Delaware would rely on a range of indices. Some potential measures could include:
> 
> **1. Weather and Climate Data:**
> 
> - Sea Surface Temperatures: Warmer temperatures can impact the health of marine life and therefore, fishing industries. You can get the data from NOAA's [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).
> 
> - Wind Speeds: High wind speeds can disrupt shipping and other marine activities. Wind data is also available at NOAA's [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).
> 
> - Sea Levels: Sea level rise due to climate change can be a risk factor impacting real estate and other coastal businesses. You'd find the data at NOAA's [Tides and Currents](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html) page.
> 
> **2. Financial and Economic Risks:**
> 
> - Regional Employment Data: Changes in employment can give signs of the health of local coastal businesses. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides monthly updates on regional employment rates.
> 
> - Real Estate Market Data: Fluctuations can suggest changes in the desirability of living and investing in coastal regions. Zillow's API gives daily updates on housing prices.
> 
> - Tourism Data: Tourist board or covert from hotel occupancy rates might give you some insights.
> 
> **3. Environmental Risks:**
> 
> - Air Quality Index: Poor air quality due to industry or other activities can impact human health and tourism. The Environmental Protection Agency provides daily updates.
> 
> - Water Quality Index: Water pollution can affect industries such as fishing and tourism. USGS's [National Water Information System](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/national-water-information-system-nwis?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) could be a source for this data.
> 
> Keep in mind it may be challenging to get some of the data on a daily basis, especially for economic and environmental indicators. Compiling all of these measures will offer a multidimensional image of the coastal economy that can be updated to reflect daily changes.
