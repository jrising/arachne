> I am preparing my external dossier for academic tenure as an interdisciplinary environmental economist. I have a few examples of the necessary sections from either disciplinary or departmental peers, but I am uncertain about some of the points of standard practice for the research section. In one tenure packet, the research statement includes a list of grants, but the others are strictly narrative. In another single tenure packet, the research statement cites papers by number and includes a bibliography, but the others use other practices. What should the research statement include?
**assistant**:
> A comprehensive and effective research statement for your academic tenure should showcase your significant contributions in your field, lay out your future research plans with regard to interdisciplinary environmental economics, and establish that your research program can sustain over the long term. Here are various subcomponents that could potentially be included:
> 
> * **Introduction:**
>   Start with a brief elevator speech of your research. Think about how you would describe it to a non-specialist in a minute or two. This section helps to frame the rest of your research statement.
> 
> * **Prior research:**
>   Demonographically and qualitatively describe your past research achievements. You may choose to build a narrative around a few key papers that you've published and the impacts they've had on the field. It might be beneficial to cite the papers by number and include a bibliography, particularly if your peers in your field use this practice.
> 
> * **Future research:**
>   Discuss your planned future research and how you foresee it contributing to the field of interdisciplinary environmental economics. Highlight the major research projects you aim to undertake and explain how they will add value to your institution and the broader academic community.
> 
> * **Grants:**
>   It's important to include information about the grants you've received. This showcases that your research has, and can, attract funding, which is a testament to its quality and relevance. You could either list them in your research statement or include it in a separate section of your dossier. Depending on the frequency and size, grant information could be made more prominent.
> 
> * **Collaboration and mentorship:**
>   Highlight instances where your research has involved a high degree of collaboration, especially interdisciplinary work, or where it has benefited from your mentorship of students or postdocs. If your work has wider impact beyond academia, be sure to include that too.
> 
> * **Fit with the department:**
>   Last but not least, indicate how your research contributes to your department's goals and enhances the overall research portfolio of the department and institution.
> 
> Remember that the expectations for what a research statement should include can greatly depend on disciplinary norms and institutional culture. It would be helpful to get advice from senior colleagues within your department, or reach out to the tenure committee for possible clarity on what they expect.
