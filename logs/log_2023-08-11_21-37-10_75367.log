> I am using a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy to identify resources and activities that should be taken into account for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. Here is a section of that report:
> ---
> Human Use
> Areas of precaution for wind turbine development carry spatial use conflicts where development may be preferable, although developers and resource managers will have significant considerations and prioritizing in the areas represented. A variety of human uses exist in the study area, from ongoing activity to submerged obstructions.
> 
> Shipping
> The mid-Atlantic region hosts high-traffic shipping routes that in many cases lie adjacent to the BOEM-designated wind energy lease blocks (WEAs) and proposed offshore wind projects. The shipping routes in the study area consist primarily of Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs), which were designated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and incorporated into the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) (IMO, 2011). The traffic separation schemes are routing measures that are meant to separate opposing streams of ship traffic through the establishment of traffic lanes. As a result of these regulations, traffic at the mouth of the Delaware Bay is orderly yet concentrated. Furthermore, to ensure safe navigation in the US waters, which is a priority of the US Coast Guard (USCG, 2011c), buffer zones will be established around the present TSSs to minimize the likelihood of shipping accidents when wind power projects are built in the vicinity. BOEM has suggested a buffer zone of up to 0.5 nautical miles (a potential increase from the initial 500 meter zone) around the Delaware TSS (DOI, 2011). Even with the currently established vessel routing measures and considerable amount of planning on behalf of BOEM and the USCG, potential conflicts between the shipping industry and offshore wind developers are likely and marine spatial planning can greatly aid with selection of appropriate wind development sites.
> To determine the habitual vessel traffic patterns outside of the designated lanes and the general distribution of the shipping traffic in the study area off the coast of Delaware, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset was analyzed. AIS is a maritime digital communication system that continuously receives and transmits vessel data over very-high frequencies (U.S. Coast Guard, 2011a). The system began operation in 2003 when the USCG implemented a vessel safety rule (Title 33 CFR 164.4, Automatic Identification System (AIS)) requiring all vessels 65 feet or greater and transiting U.S. waters to carry an AIS transponder.
> The initial goal for AIS was to help vessels to avoid collisions and assist port authorities in ship traffic control. Today, AIS is programmed to transmit the vessel’s name, call sign, dimensions, speed, destination and other parameters multiple times each minute on two VHF channels (Silber & Bettridge, 2010). Since 2003, requirements regarding which vessels must carry AIS transponders have been broadened. The initial goal for AIS was to help vessels to avoid collisions and assist port authorities in ship traffic control. Today, AIS is programmed to transmit the vessel’s name, call sign, dimensions, speed, destination and other parameters multiple times each minute on two VHF channels (Silber & Bettridge, 2010). The USCG is currently establishing a National Automatic Identification System (NAIS), which is a network of land-based receivers and relayers that will provide coverage of normal movement of AIS-equipped traffic, help during rescue operations and aid in prevention and investigation of maritime incidents (USCG, 2011b)
> 
> AIS Data Analysis
> To determine the traffic patterns in the project study area, one year of data for 2009 (with a partial month of June) was obtained through confidentiality agreements with BOEM and NOAA. Thus, the data available represented slightly less than one year of ship traffic. This data allows for fine-scale analysis of travelled commercial shipping patterns in the mid-Atlantic. To determine the routes travelled from a point dataset, a beta tool (AIS Data Handler for ArcMap 10) developed by NOAA Coastal Services Center (NOAA, 2011) was used to convert points to tracklines (polylines) linking broadcast data from unique vessel identification numbers for each month. Due to the very large amount of data, the monthly tracklines were not merged together to create an annual dataset, as ArcGIS 10 software was not able to process such amount of data. As a result, the data used in the analysis and presented in the report represent AIS data from months of December and July 2009. These two months were chosen to illustrate the winter and summer patterns in ship traffic in the study area off Delaware and can be used for the initial steps of the MSP process. Please refer to Maps 38 and 39.
> For further data analysis, an open source GIS software package Quantum GIS (QGIS) was used. Although only monthly increments of data were used, the tracklines (vessel tracks in vector data format) for each month needed to be simplified. This was accomplished by reducing the number of nodes by a factor of approximately 10. The lengths of tracklines were summed in a 1-minute grid cell resolution to depict relative density of shipping traffic in the study area. The map does not portray the exact number of vessels per grid cell; rather, relative density was chosen to indicate areas of maximum spatial conflict. The resulting dataset was converted to raster to allow for viewing the data in a gradient and explicitly shows the intensity of vessel traffic throughout the study area.
> It is important to note the difficulties and caveats of the presented AIS data analysis. The AIS data are not without faults, which can potentially be related to the beta-status of the NOAA’s AIS Data Handler tool or of the data itself. The number of vessel tracklines that resemble straight lines and cross the land is significant. Many of the tracklines appear to connect two points, such as Montreal and Baltimore, but do not include data about vessels’ starting time, cargo type, etc. These issues do not impede the usability of the data as a whole, but emphasize the need for a more detailed analysis, which are beyond the scope of this project.
> Shipping data analysis sheds light on where the most densely trafficked routes are located and how offshore wind projects could be planned to minimize shipping conflicts. Maps for the months of December and July show that shipping traffic varies by season. The majority of the vessel traffic is concentrated within the TSS, near its exit and entrance, and in a few areas along the coast. Even though analysis for every month has not been completed, the routes that vessels most commonly choose while traveling close to the coast are discernible. Furthermore, it is important to note that there are some differences in the values and the smoothness of the color range shown in the rasterized datasets for the months of December and July. The December traffic areas are more pronounced than those in July, though the traffic is concentrated in the same zones in both periods. These variations are related to the number of recorded tracklines for the corresponding month, but are not surprising considering the seasonal variation in shipping. More specifically, the original dataset for December contains 4,710 tracklines, while July dataset is made up of 6,072 tracks. The clipped and simplified datasets contain 1,297 lines for December and 1,732 lines for July. The novelty of the AIS Data Handler tool and its point-to-trackline conversion methods can play a role in the way this data was initially converted and represented, but do not suggest that the data is flawed.
> Traffic Separation Schemes
> As a part of the shipping data layer, shapefiles for the TSS at the mouth of the Delaware Bay were added, and then extended by approximately 12 nautical miles to account for the fact that ships have to disperse into the Maryland waters, and adjusted for width with 0.5 nautical mile buffers on each side. Where buffering via GIS tool was not possible, the 0.5 nm buffer was drawn manually. The Maryland Energy Administration suggested this buffer width for the MD WEA to address concerns that had been expressed over navigational safety of ships entering and exiting the Delaware Bay (Wolff, 2011). Though not yet finalized, the 0.5 nm buffer was used in this analysis as a likely minimum buffer that BOEM and USCG will require (Wolff, 2011; DOI, 2011). Additionally, circles are shown to represent the most likely dissipation area after vessels exit/enter the TSS. TSSs and buffer areas around TSS’s should be considered exclusion areas at this time.
> Anchorage Area
> Areas adjacent to USCG traffic separation scheme shipping lanes are commonly used as anchorage areas for ships entering or exiting ports through the Delaware Bay and River (BOEM, 2012). This major shipping passage is congested, and vessels often use an adjacent area to anchor for a period of time, albeit unofficially, while waiting to go to port. The USCG is considering designating this area an official anchorage ground and requested that the area be excluded from consideration for leasing (BOEM, 2012). If it is designated an official anchorage ground in the future, the area will be rendered exclusionary of activities that can occur on the water or on the seafloor, such as cable- laying (BOEM, 2011). The anchorage ground is bounded on its southern border by the southeast TSS approach to the Delaware Bay, on its northern border by the charted ordnance dumping ground, and on its eastern border by the 12 nm territorial sea line, and is equivalent to about half of an OCS block in size (see Map 38 and 39). A polygon was drawn in ArcGIS to delineate an approximate location of the anchorage ground.
