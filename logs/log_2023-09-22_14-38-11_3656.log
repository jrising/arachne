> Is there a way to ask ggplot to go through the motions of drawing a geom (a geom_tile for me), including adding it to the legend, but not actually have it draw that geom on the plot?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is a way to ask `ggplot` to include a specific geom in the legend without actually plotting it on the plot. You can achieve this by using a dummy or placeholder data frame that contains the values and aesthetics you want to show in the legend, but with no corresponding points or tiles to be displayed on the plot.

> 
> In this example, we create a dummy data frame called `legend_data` with `x`, `y`, and `fill` aesthetics. We then create a blank plot using `ggplot()` and set the theme to `theme_void()` to remove axes and background. Finally, we add `geom_tile` to the plot using the dummy data frame, specifying the aesthetics and setting `show.legend = TRUE` to include it in the legend. Running `p` will display the plot with the geom not actually plotted on it, but still appearing in the legend.

> You can adapt this approach for other geoms as well. Just create a dummy data frame with the desired aesthetics, add the geom to the plot with that data, and set `show.legend = TRUE`.
