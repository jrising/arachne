**user**:
> Is there a package in R for reading/writing Markdown? The main functionality I need is actually just extracting sections (and subsections), and rearranging them.
**assistant**:
> Yes, there are several R packages that can help with reading and manipulating Markdown files, although Markdown is primarily meant for human-readable text rather than structured data.
> 
> 1. **rmarkdown**: While primarily used for rendering R Markdown documents, `rmarkdown` itself might be too tailored to rendering rather than restructuring content.
> 
> 2. **knitr**: Similar to `rmarkdown`, `knitr` is more about knitting R code into Markdown rather than manipulating text. However, it is useful for understanding the document's structure when knitting programmatically.
> 
> 3. **markdown**: This package allows for a basic conversion from Markdown to HTML and vice versa, which could indirectly assist you in understanding section divisions via HTML tags.
> 
> 4. **commonmark**: This package provides parsing capabilities using the CommonMark spec. You can parse Markdown into an abstract syntax tree (AST), which can then be traversed to extract and rearrange sections.
> 
> 5. **pandoc**: A powerful tool often called from R using system commands. You can convert Markdown to a data structure that can be more easily manipulated, such as JSON, and then convert it back. This approach can give you a programmatic handle on the document structure.
> 
> For your specific needs of extracting and rearranging sections, `commonmark` might be directly useful. You can parse the document into an AST, work on rearranging nodes, and reconstruct the document. Here's a very basic example of using `commonmark` to inspect a Markdown file:
> 
> ```r
> library(commonmark)
> 
> # Markdown content
> markdown_text <- readLines("yourfile.md")
> 
> # Parse the Markdown document
> parsed <- markdown_xml(markdown_text)
> 
> # This returns an XML-like representation of the structure
> cat(parsed)
> 
> # You'll need additional logic to traverse and rearrange sections
> # This could involve parsing the XML or using the AST to identify headings
> ```
> 
> For more involved restructuring, you might need to combine parsing with some custom logic for identification and rearrangement. You could extend these capabilities using R's XML libraries or, for primarily text-based operations, employing regex.
> 
> The other alternative is using **rmarkdown**, **knitr**, or directly **pandoc** for document conversion and programmatic document manipulation based on a transformed format. 
> 
> If you want detailed guidance on implementation, just let me know!
