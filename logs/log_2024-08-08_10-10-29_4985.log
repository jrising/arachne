> I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a Master's degree under your supervision at the University of Delaware. With a strong academic background in Environmental Science and a passion for understanding the intricate relationships between human activities, political dynamics, and environmental change, I am eager to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research in this field.

> My journey in Environmental Science began at the University of Chittagong, where I excelled academically and developed practical skills in environmental modeling using tools such as QGIS and Anaconda. Through my participation in the Sakura Science Exchange Program at Nara Women’s University, Japan, I further honed my research capabilities by investigating the impact of global warming on mosquito populations, employing Python programming for environmental modeling.

> My research experience extends to collaborative projects, such as studying the lifecycle of Strongyloides parasites in Bastuhara slums, Chattogram, with the University of Liverpool and investigating the effects of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering on precipitation patterns in Bangladesh at the University of Chittagong. These experiences have equipped me with robust data collection skills and a deep understanding of environmental processes, preparing me for rigorous academic inquiry.

> Bangladesh, my home country, has unique problems caused by political instability, which deeply affects its economy and worsens its environmental issues like climate change. Inspired by your work on combining climate science and economic analysis to assess climate change damages, I want to explore how political unrest in Bangladesh affects its economy and increases its climate challenges.
> 
>  
> 
> Specifically, I am interested in investigating:
> 
> - The socioeconomic impacts of political unrest on vulnerable communities in Bangladesh.
> 
> - The interplay between political instability, economic resilience, and adaptive capacity in the face of climate change.
> 
> - Policy implications for sustainable development and climate resilience strategies amidst political turbulence.
> 
>  
> 
> I am confident that pursuing a Master's degree under your guidance will not only allow me to contribute meaningfully to the academic discourse but also enable me to leverage my skills in stakeholder engagement and community-driven research methodologies to address pressing environmental challenges.
> 
>  
> 
> I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my research interests, funding opportunities and potential contributions further. Thank you for considering my application.
