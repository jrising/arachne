> # IMT Fundraising Strategy
> 
> ## Purpose
> 
> The aim of this strategy is to ensure the **financial health of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT)**. Through effective engagement of existing donors and outreach to potential donors, we aim to introduce our work to new audiences, thereby broadening our support base. This serves more than just immediate financial needs - it is a crucial part of IMT's growth and sustainability.
> 
> ## Goal Setting 
> 
> Our fundraising strategy is guided by clear and quantifiable objectives. In this season, we measure success by the number of new foundations and corporations we reach. However, our ambition is not confined to just 'reaching out' - we aim to kindle a relationship with these entities, leading to enduring partnerships for sustainable change.
> 
> ## Donor Management 
> 
> A proactive approach to donor management undergirds our fundraising strategy. Identifying, reaching out, and managing donor relations is a three-pronged process:
> 
> 1. **Identify**: We will research potential donors whose mission aligns with ours–focusing on entities that share our commitment in driving sustainable change. 
> 2. **Reach out**: With a tailored approach, we will initiate conversations, presenting an engaging overview of IMT's work, impact, and future plans.
> 3. **Manage**: Donor relations is an ongoing process. We aim to nourish established relationships through regular updates, engagement, and acknowledgment of contributions.
> 
> ## Sustainability
> 
> Fundraising is not a isolated event but a long-term commitment, involving timely forecasting and meticulous planning. This Spring/Summer's strategy forms a part of a comprehensive agenda that IMT aspires to design and execute, in collaboration with its leadership and relevant stakeholders.
> 
> ## Corporate Membership Playbook
> 
> As a part of our fundraising effort, we're developing a [Corporate Membership Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcKS285sDCYo61OBB8zYnGJsJK-CiTUxGT11BX2_paA/edit). Designed as a comprehensive guide, this playbook will delve into specifics on how to initiate, engage, and sustain corporate partnership.
> 
> ## Team Alignment
> 
> A clear, shared understanding of our fundraising strategy is pivotal. We will ensure all teams (Programs, Communications, and others) understand and are aligned with our vision and strategy. Utilizing everyone's strengths and networks can boost our reach and potential for success.
> 
> Our shared endeavor is not merely about securing funds; it is about forging partnerships that drive sustainable and market transformation. Our fundraising journey is a measure of IMT's growth, resilience, and commitment to building a sustainable future.
