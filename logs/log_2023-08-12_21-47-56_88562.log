**assistant**:
> The cheapest option for cold storage of archived data currently would be cloud-based services, as they offer scale, accessibility, and relatively low costs. Particularly:
> 
> 1. **Amazon S3 Glacier** - Glacier is Amazon's cold storage option, designed specifically for data archiving and long-term backup. It's secure, durable, and extremely low-cost.
> 
> 2. **Google's Coldline Storage** - Coldline is designed for cold archiving â€” data your business expects to touch less than once a year. It's cheap and highly durable.
> 
> 3. **Microsoft Azure's Archive Storage** - This is an extremely low-cost, durable, and secure cloud storage solution for rarely accessed data with flexible latency needs.
> 
> The exact cost will depend on your specific needs like the amount of data you need to store, the length of storage, retrieval needs, data redundancy requirements, and so on, but these three services generally offer competitive prices.
> 
> Before making a decision, consider factors such as how often you may need to access the stored data, and whether the data will need to be accessed all at once or in increments. Extra costs often arise for larger than expected data retrieval.
> 
> However, it's worth noting that if you have a large physical facility and you plan to archive data for many decades, investing in your own cold storage infrastructure could potentially be less expensive in the long run after an initial high upfront cost.
> 
> Remember to always back up data and have a disaster recovery plan no matter what solution you choose.
