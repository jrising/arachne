> I will be developing a course called "Coupling Human to Natural Systems" with the following description:
> As humans increase their demands on the resources and services provided by the
> environment, there is an increasing need to understand how human systems and natural systems interact. Understanding how natural resources are accessed, renewed, and valued depend on both physical and biological rates in the environment. Learning how these systems can be coupled, and what the feedbacks exist between these systems is critical for building sustainable practices that support growing demands on the natural environment. The course is intended to introduce graduate students to the idea and techniques of “coupling” natural systems to human systems. The “coupling” includes microeconomics, biophysical modeling, data discovery, optimal management of renewable resources, and design of policy. Students are expected to gain insights into how disciplines like economics are related to environmental science.
> 
> This course will combine lecture (Tuesdays), introducing students to the theory and detailed examples of coupling, with a weekly practicum (Thursdays), where students will learn to build and evaluate coupled system models.
> 
> The course is roughly split into 3 modules, to study natural-human coupling in three contexts: Polynesian islands, marine fisheries, and global climate change. Each of these modules offer different issues, scales, and modeling and management challenges. 
> 
> The practicums will use Vensim (https://vensim.com/), a system dynamics modeling platform, for simulation and policy evaluation. The course will teach system modeling, stocks and flows, feedback loops, and other system concepts. Prior experience with Vensim and system dynamics is not expected.
