> PROJECT REVIEW REPORT (GENERAL PROJECT REVIEW/SPECIFIC ISSUES REVIEW) (H2020)
>   This document contains different templates for project review reports (general project reviews and specific reviews). 
>   Project reviews are all formal project reviews (i.e. reviews which follow the procedural conditions of the grant agreement and thus lead to a report which can be externalised and used as evidence for Chapter 6 measures). They can be with or without outside experts (including partial expert input). 
>   For project reviews with experts, it is the experts’ consolidated report that is sent to the coordinator for observations, together with the PO draft review report letter. For project reviews without experts or project reviews with partial expert input, the PO writes the review report and this review report is externalised. The expert’s partial input remains internal.

> Overall assessment
> 
> The project has achieved some of its objectives and milestones. However, corrective action will be required.
> Significant results linked to dissemination, exploitation and impact potential
> Give the most significant exploitable results delivered by the project during the period under review, mentioning for each: type and purpose of result; which group of stakeholders could exploit it; how it is made available for stakeholders (dissemination channel, IPR issues); expected impact.
> 
> The project is likely to provide results with significant immediate or potential impact in the next reporting period (even if not all objectives mentioned in the Annex 1 GA were achieved).
> The TransformAr Avoided Damages Application is a good foundation for a much-needed tool, pointing communities to adaptation options and relevant KPIs (D3.4). Similarly, the Book of Nature-Based Solutions has the potential to clarify NBS adaptation options across many contexts (D4.3).
> The standardized process of stakeholder engagement, pathway construction, multiple-criteria evaluation of pathways, and KPI tracking is broadly applicable, as shown across the case studies. It is expected to improve adaptation decision-making if applied beyond the case study regions (D3.7).
> Generally, the adaptation projects supported under TransformAr represent an excellent cross-cutting range of adaptation options, which can provide strong impacts in those communities, and much will be learned by their careful monitoring (D6.8).
> General comments 
> Give your overall assessment of the project activities (based on the description of the action (DoA-Annex 1) and the deliverables and reports submitted), and in particular on the following:
> •	results:
> o	main scientific and/or technological achievements of the project
> o	main innovation outputs (if applicable)
> o	contribution to the state of the art
> o	scientific and/or technological quality of the results
> o	impact on technology and/or society
> o	impact on the researcher career (if applicable)
> o	dissemination activities and results: publications, users involved, etc.
> o	protection of the acquired intellectual property (patents applications, etc.)
> •	progress of the activities:
> o	main research / innovation (if applicable) / training (if applicable) / transfer of knowledge activities (if applicable)
> o	achievement of the objectives, compliance with the work plan, any deviations (whether justified) and corrective actions (whether acceptable). 
> o	milestones for the period and submission and acceptance of deliverables (if applicable). 
> o	take-up of the recommendations from the previous review or check (if applicable)
> o	use of resources (are they in line with the DoA, do they represent good value for money?) (if applicable).
> TransformAr has built upon the state-of-the-art in climate impact projections and economic assessment to translate evidence relevant to stakeholders into actionable information, including identifying regions with the greatest need for adaptation (WP2).
> TransformAr has also engaged in a wide range of green, grey, and hybrid adaptation projects across the six demonstrators (WP4). These projects have been paired with carefully developed stakeholder engagement practices, which are broadly applicable for adaptation planning across the EU (WP3).
> The project has shown good progress in achieving its objectives.
> However, there are deviations during this reporting period which may not be acceptable:
> There is a significant disconnect between WP2 and work packages that would benefit from its outputs (WP3 and the cost-benefit work in WP6). Even recognizing that delays in the availability of data make some of these connections challenging, it is problematic that stakeholder planning processes appear ill-designed to incorporate risk information.
> There is also a lack of information flowing from WP4 and WP5 into the cost-benefit work in WP6.
> Recommendations concerning the period covered by the report
> Give your recommendations on:
> •	the acceptance or rejection of resources, or on the necessity to provide further justifications on use of resources
> •	work done and possible required corrective actions (e.g., resubmission of reports or deliverables)
> •	dissemination and communication activities
> •	exploitation plans
> •	other, if applicable.
> Acceptance or rejection of resources:
> Resources appear commensurate with the needs of the work performed.
> Work done and possible required corrective actions:
> During the second reporting period, TransformAr has provided all designated deliverables. Seven deliverables have revisions requested:
> -	The methodological choices in D2.5 (the geometric mean, inclusion of low-relevance indicators, definition of “low impact” regions, aggregation across sectors, and handling of missing risks) have implications for the interpretation and quality of outcomes. These may be unjustifiable, but at a minimum need to be elaborated.
> -	The use of a linear normalization in D2.6 is problematic for several sectors (agriculture, water scarcity, and labour productivity).
> -	An index that synthesizes across multiple sectors, as included in the DoA for D2.6, is missing.
> -	The TADF and TADA described in D3.4 do not make a clear linkage with the structure or results from WP2. Deliverable D3.5 is expected to make use of WP2 quantitative results, but very few results were used and only for MOE.
> -	Many of the indicators described in D3.5 are problematic. Many have a very tenuous connection to climate impacts and some have mathematical issues. Of greater concern, there does not appear to be a pathway for evaluating the values of these under projected climate change or to attribute changes in them to adaptation practices even with close observation. As discussed in the review meeting, "Projection to the future capacity" should be a key criteria, but does not appear to have been considered here.
> -	D3.5 also introduces the hazard-first approach to directing stakeholders to adaptation practices, but this requires specific stakeholder knowledge and may not be an effective approach for upscaling.
> -	D3.6 is labelled as “Replicable Socio-economic impact assessment tools of transformational pathways” but only one tool is discussed (the Nature Smart Cities Business model), which was not developed under TransformAr, and its applicability and replicability is evaluated based on a single case study representing a very small part of a demonstrator region.
> -	Deliverable D4.4 claims that a full video (the main outcome described in D27) will be released in October 2024, but it appears to still be unavailable.
> -	In Deliverable D5.8, Guadeloupe, MOE, and Lappeenranta are not provided with a clear evaluation procedure and relevant KPIs.
> Dissemination and communication activities:
> Dissemination and communication activities are appropriate for the project, with the possible exception of upscaling plans as discussed for deliverable D4.3.
> Recommendations concerning future work
> Give your recommendations (e.g., overall modifications, corrective actions at WP level, re-tuning of the objectives to optimise the impact or to keep up with the state of the art, better use of resources, re-focusing, revision of the dissemination and exploitation plan, update of data management plan, etc.) Where appropriate, indicate the timescale for implementation.
> Future work should provide a much clearer evaluation of the projects, including their operational and policy costs, the extent of avoid impacts including who benefits, and the features of the various demonstrator contexts that drive these results.
> The number of academic publications (3 journal articles, 2 conference proceedings articles) may suggest that the academic pathway to dissemination is being under-utilitzed. However, this also reflects publication delays. The consortium is encouraged to increase its publication of project innovations.
> As described in Annex 1 for deliverable D4.3, intended to provide “Key strategies for dissemination and scaling of NBS”, none of the approaches to upscaling are sufficient to actually facilitate greater use of the projects. It is understood that the upscaling strategy will be better exhibited in the exploitation, dissemination and communication tasks, and this should be achieved there also for NBS.

> 2.	Objectives and workplan
> Is the progress reported in line with objectives and work plan as specified in the DoA?  If there are significant deviations, please comment.
> Assess to what extent the objectives of the project for the period have been achieved. In particular, please indicate if the project as a whole has been making satisfactory progress in relation to the DoA and comment on the interaction between the work packages and the level of integration demonstrated. 
> For each work package (WP), assess the progress in relation to the DoA (including the achievement of deliverables and milestones) and periodic report and comment on any deviation and/or delays, the reasons for them and corresponding corrective action taken.
> For MSCA, comment on: recruitment, training and career development, secondment, transfer of knowledge.
> For innovation actions (IA), assess whether the pilots/case studies started to showcase innovative results as described in the DoA.	Partially 
> During the second reporting period, TransformAr has achieved its main objectives. Possible points of concern are as follows:
> -	Objective SO2 designates user-friendly data access, but the provided web portal tool (Klimafolgen) had multiple problems in basic operation when tested (see comments for D2.2). Also, all of the deliverables provided in support of this objective are related to risk data, while the objective refers to the broader data relevant to adaptation.
> -	Objective S04 requires the evaluation of adaptation projects. Although some projects are paired with an evaluation procedure, there were identified problems for Guadeloupe, MOE, and Lappeenranta (see D5.8 comments).
> -	The DoA specifies, "NCSRD will develop and apply, for each demonstrator, a decision support system for avoided damages and ex ante socio-economic impact assessment to assess the various pathways and delineate their performances, pros and cons." D3.5 only provides this for Egaleo and the technical report mentions applying this to 1-2 more demonstrators. The justification given for this deviation was data availability, but this in fact suggests that the approach is not very applicable. At the same time, it would seem that WP2 provides a strong data basis for avoided damage estimates, but the current approach does not use it. An alternative which defines KPIs that could be quantified through a combination of WP2 results and stakeholder knowledge would have appeared much more appropriate to the goals of TransformAr.
> -	The DoA describes Task T6.2 as evaluating the costs and benefits of the solutions, but the associated deliverable D6.2 fall far short of this. Costs and benefits are not measured at a project level, and the survey approach and economic risk assessment that are used to replace cannot be used to produce direct cost-benefit comparisons.
> Are the objectives of the project still scientifically and/or technologically relevant?
> Assess whether the project continues to be scientifically and/or technologically relevant.
> Indicate whether the objectives are still relevant and provide scientific and/or technological breakthrough potential and whether they are still achievable within the time and resources available to the project. 
> Assess also whether the approach and methodology, continue to be relevant (not applicable to MSCA).	Yes 
> The improved planning and development of adaptation remains critical to the future management of climate impacts, and the existing state of knowledge is remains insufficient to the task of supporting local stakeholders.
> The economic evaluation of tourism risks for the EU is a useful addition to the literature, particularly in the context of other important impacts (on agriculture, fisheries, labour productivity, and land from flooding) (D2.4).
> Are the critical implementation risks and mitigation actions described in the DoA still relevant?
> Assess how the identified risks in the project are managed, including the new risks identified in the reporting period, if any, and the proposed mitigation measures.	Yes 
> Delays have been observed across a number of the tasks and deliverables, but critical risks appear to continue to be carefully managed. Outputs intended to be produced by stakeholders have in some cases been produced by internal partners, but this has allowed future adaptation steps to progress.
> [OPTION for innovation actions (IA): Have the pilots/case studies started to showcase innovative results as described in the DoA? 	Partially 
> In many cases, demonstrators are well-advanced in their work. However, evaluation of the results of this work is still needed.
> Have the ethics deliverables due for the current period been adequately addressed and approved?	Not applicable
> No ethics deliverables were submitted.
> Have the comments and recommendations from previous project reviews been taken into account?	Yes 
> Required deliverable resubmissions have been provided. 
> 
> 3.	Impact
> [OPTION 1 by default:  Does the work carried out contribute to the expected impacts detailed in the DoA? ]
> For MSCA, assess also how the project enhances the career perspectives of the researcher/seconded staff member. 
> For MSCA multi-beneficiary projects, Assess how the project contributes to the development of lasting collaboration and its impact on the European Research Area.
> [OPTION 2 for FET Open:  Is there any potential that the work carried out within the project will initiate or consolidate a new line of technology and its future uses? Can the project claim to have a transformational impact on technology and/or society? ]
> For FET Open, provide information regarding methods and measures used to achieve this impact on technology and/or society.	Partially
> The work is closely aligned with the DoA, with the exception of other issues listed under recommendations for the current period. 
> [OPTION 1 by default: Does the work carried out follow the plan detailed in the DoA to enhance innovation capacity, create new markets opportunities, strengthen  competitiveness and growth of  companies, address issues related to climate change or the environment, address industrial and/or societal  needs at regional level or bring other important benefits for society? Give information on the relevant innovation activities carried out (prototypes, testing activities, standards, clinical trials) and/or new product, service, reference materials, process or method (to be) launched to the market, if any. ]
> [OPTION 2 for FET Open:  Do the interdisciplinary collaborations within the project bridge symbiotically advanced scientific and technological fields? Please, comment if the interdisciplinary collaborations result in the proposition of novel research and innovation practices. ]	Yes
> Across the demonstrators, projects are aimed at creating new market opportunities, addressing climate change risks, and bringing benefits to society.
> Does the work carried out contribute towards European policy objectives and strategies and have an impact on policy making?
> Assess whether the project results or activities have an impact on policies, (e.g. healthcare, transport, environment, energy, migration, regional development, etc.) by supporting policy implementation, policy stakeholder engagement or exploring new technological approaches for policy objectives. Assess whether it would be useful if the project presents its findings to policy makers or includes policy makers in an advisory board.	Yes
> The project supports EU and local policy objectives around climate risks and ensuring resilient communities.
> [OPTION 1 by default:  Does (or will) the work carried out have an impact on SMEs? ]
> [OPTION for FET Open: Does the project involve new and high potential actors? Do they contribute to strengthen European scientific and industrial leadership in the early exploration of new and emerging technologies? Does the contribution go beyond academic excellence and with global recognition? (New potential actors = young excellent researchers, high-tech innovative SMEs). ]	Yes
> SMEs stand to benefit under the Smart Cities Business model and in response to the wealth of local risk and adaptation information provided by the project.
> Have the beneficiaries reached gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action? If not, have the reasons been explained in the periodic report? 	Yes
> With the possible exception of NTNU, all partners have reasonable gender balance across all segments of their workforces.
> 
> 4.	Implementation
> Has the project been efficiently and effectively managed? 	Yes
> The outcomes of the project reflect clear and effective management across all levels of the project, with the exception of WP2-WP3 coordination described above.
> Is the management of the project in line with the obligations of beneficiaries (including ethics and security requirements, risk and innovation management, if applicable)? 	Yes
> There are not evident conflicts between beneficiary obligations and the project management practices.
> [OPTION for ERA-NET:  Has the co-funded call been implemented in compliance with the DoA, the previously approved call text and the ERA-NET Cofund requirements? Does the observers’ report on the evaluation confirm that the peer review evaluation, the ranking and selection procedure meets the ERA-NET Cofund requirements? Does the selection list follow the ranking list(s)?]	Not applicable
> 
> [OPTION for multi-beneficiary projects: Is the contribution of each beneficiary in line with the work committed in the DoA? ]	Yes
> Resources are commensurate with the contributions of each partner.
> Have the beneficiaries disseminated project results (foreground) in scientific publications as planned in the DoA (including the deposition of publications in open access repositories)? Do they include a reference to EU funding?	Partially
> Five publications have been produced in the reporting period. Given the importance of the academic channel to disseminate results, this is an area that should be monitored as reasonable publication timelines allow.
> Have the beneficiaries disseminated and communicated project activities and results by other means than scientific publications (social media, press-release, the project web site, video/film, etc) as planned in the DoA? Do they include a reference to EU funding?	Partially
> The consortium has produced non-scientific publications, social media posts, and videos, and has participated in many conferences and workshops. However, some major dissemination pathways are incomplete: The data portal (D2.2) is currently not fully functional and the nature based solution video (D4.4) is not currently available.
> Has the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results (if required) been updated and implemented as described in the DoA, in particular as regards intellectual property rights? Is it appropriate?
> Give details if a (further) update is needed.	Yes
> In response to a previous rejection, deliverable D6.6 has been resubmitted with IP information, and further IP discussion is planned for deliverable D6.7.
> Has the data management plan (DMP) (if required) been updated and implemented? Is it appropriate?
> Give details if a (further) update is needed.	Not applicable
> No updates to the DMP are described, but none are required.
> [OPTION for Science with and for society (SWAFS): Have the proposed institutional changes been appropriately promoted? ]	Not applicable
> 
> 
> 5.	Resources
> Were the resources used as described in the DoA and were they necessary to achieve its objectives? If there are deviations from planned budget, have they been satisfactorily explained?  Have they been used in a manner consistent with the principle of sound financial management (in particular economy, efficiency and effectiveness)? 	Partially
> Objectives have been largely achieved, with no significant deviations from the planned budget. However, the budget has only allowed minimal stakeholder meetings (one per demonstrator for scenario planning and one per demonstrator for implementation). As a result, only a small cross-section of stakeholders (about 10 per demonstrator) have been involved in the planning process.
> [OPTION for ERA-NET: Is the necessary national funding for the selected projects covered by the ‘commitments on availability of funds’?]	Not applicable

> D2.2	D9	Accepted  	The Web Portal (Klimafolgen) tool is a notable extension beyond the core requirements of the grant, but it has significant problems. In many cases, it just does not show results. For example, for the Agriculture data for Europe, the map shows, but clicking on the map brings up an empty table for all crops. Under water for Europe, only annual values are available and all season columns are empty (not only for values like surface runoff, but even for just precipitation). Figure 9 in the technical report shows NUTS2 regions, but these do not appear to be available in the online tool.
> The bias-correction method may be inappropriate. Lange et al. 2018 was developed for solar radiation, and it is not clear how the trend-preserving quantile mapping was applied to temperature and precipitation. Also, consistency between temperature and precipitation is important for many biophysical results, but it appears that the downscaling method was applied to each variable independently.
> The proposal states that NCSRD will using RCMs to provide 20 km grid resolution for Europe and 5 km resolution “where necessary”. However, it is stated here that RCMs are only used for the Athens metropolitan area and calibrating the weather generator. Elsewhere, empirical downscaling is used.
> IMAGE-PIK: Conceptually sensible, but there is no validation information on how timeseries look and how spatial patterns vary on a daily basis relative to the observed record.
> D2.3	D10	Accepted 	Agriculture impacts are area-weighted, which results in an aggregate yield change across a collection of crops. However, this is not a consistent way to describe sectoral productivity reduction, since not all crops have the same economic value (price) or start from the same yield so that yield-unit losses are equally significant.
> Flooding from D2.2 relies on the SWIM model, but it is not clear how or if these results inform the economic flooding valuation in D2.3. Only PESETA and COACCH results are discussed.
> The WBGT productivity losses appear to only be calculated for outdoor temperatures, but there is no discussion of which sectors or activities these apply to.
> There is no discussion of the Bayesian network structure described in the proposal.
> There does not appear to be a systematic review performed here. While various projects and literature are reviewed, there is no protocol for how they are identified and evaluated.
> D2.4	D11	Accepted 	Regional attractiveness indexes are not intended for downscaling.
> The observed disaggregations often have both positive and negative impacts in the same country, derived from a downscaling of a single (positive or negative) impact. It is not clear how this could result from an index, which generally should just provide weights.
> As before, labour productivity assumed WBGT applies in air-conditioned settings. Notably, this is orthogonal to the intensity level of the work.
> Outcomes in the agriculture sector will depend upon the extent of climate impacts in other countries. If other countries are worse hit, outcomes will be better for the EU. It is not clear what assumptions are made.
> D2.5	D12	Request for revision
>  	The geometric mean risk score is not consistent with other approaches (e.g., the WB’s multiplicative approach, INFORM’s weighted average approach, a fiscal risk approach, or a welfare-based approach).
> For exposure, the choice of a geometric mean implies that values will be downward biased. That is, while the rank categories are uniformly distributed, the geometric mean exposure levels are weighted toward lower levels of exposure.
> The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Said another way, using subsets of the indicators would have produced a more accurate or robust result, and as new indicators are added beyond this, the value of the analysis was reduced. Vulnerability is not, as section 2.2.3 suggestions, sector agnostic.
> The assignment of “low impact” is not consistent for flooding impacts. If flooding conditions improve that is equivalent to historically underperforming yields increasing.
> The use of a geometric mean across sectors is not a justifiable description of actual risk (in fiscal, economic, or social terms). The ranking process drops information about relative importance of sectors as well as the absolute importance of sectors relative to other features of society.
> If I understand the Tourism results discussion correctly, medium and high risk counties are those that will experience only small increases in tourism. Like Agriculture, this seems like a poor description of “risk”.
> If I understand the aggregated risk discussion correctly, missing data is interpreted as no risk in the aggregation. Given that this is already a very limited collection of sectors, is seems odd not to just perform the geometric mean over fewer sectors in those regions with missing data.
> D2.6	D13	Request for revision
>  	The construction of risk is redesigned between D12 and D13, with hazards rather than biophysical impacts and sector-specific vulnerability indicators. This may be because these were produced by different institutions, but it is at odds with the narrative of the proposal.
> This also produces problematic consequences for the prioritization of regions. For example, Thessaloniki is identified as the region with the 6th greatest CRI, but is classified as “no risk” under RCP 8.5 in 2050.
> A linear normalization is inappropriate in many cases:
> -	Agriculture is nonlinearly affected by the amount of precipitation and affected at a daily level by water balance.
> -	Water scarcity depends, mainly, upon local conditions, not absolute minima and maxima.
> -	As with the categorical indicators in D12, the combination of a linearly transformed indicator with a geometric mean produces implicit biases that are not discussed.
> Given the economic importance of losses to labour productivity, it is surprising that the CRI and Hazard maps show so few regions with high indicator levels. I suspect this is due to the linear scaling, where some regions have very high values causing all others to be grouped into the lower risk categories.
> Only sector-specific risks are calculated, but the proposal discusses identifying the creation of a synthetic index with the implication that it would include multiple climate impacts.
> D3.4	D18	Request for revision 	The process described here is meant to be partially based on results from WP2, but that connection has not engaged with the actual structure or results of WP2. There is a comment that an updated version of the tools will be released based on WP2, but it is not clear how this fits with the timeline of the project.
> It is not clear where any of the available KPI values are from (perhaps a previous task?).
> Calling this a “tool for socioeconomic impact assessment” seems a stretch. It is a collection of records. To do any assessment, one would have to treat this as input data and then export it to do the assessment.
> D3.5	D19	Request for revision 	Presumably, eq. 3.1 means to have sum(a_n) in the denominator.
> Terminology: Direct is usually not a synonym for (bio-)physical; Economic and health are both subset of social.
> Future avoided damages are not calculated correctly. It should be (D^nS_CC – D^s_CC) / D^nS_CC. Suppose that damages without a solution will get 10x worse than baseline under climate change, but a solution can halve that. The current equation produces a negative avoided damages number.
> Problems with indicators:
> -	Global Climate Risk Index: (1) Why are both number of deaths and deaths per 100k included? Either you want per person results or not.  (2) Half of this index is economic and all of it is social, and yet it is listed as a physical KPI.
> -	The “equation/formula” column includes a mix of formula, methods (“field measurements”—which ones and how are they used?), and units (“€”—what is included in “infrastructure”, e.g.?).
> -	There is almost no connection between the indicative physical changes described for physical damages and the KPIs used to indicate them.
> -	GDP Growth Contribution: (1) Since Growth is already a log value, it is odd to take ratios of it, and this can produce nonsensical results. It should be a difference.
> -	Does Import value index increase or decrease with climate change? It depends upon relative prices, which depend upon relative impacts, so whether equation 3.2 is used is ambiguous.
> -	Only market indices are used under economic damages. Economic damages also includes the value (e.g. WTP) of non-market goods (e.g., biodiversity), which is currently missing.
> -	Reduced emissions and CO2 intensity are not measures of damages.
> -	The air quality index describes itself both as a ranking (which is then a measure of relative damages) and concentrations. Which is it?
> -	Mortality rate is going to be falling in some regions under climate change (e.g., Sweden due to less extreme winters) and rising in other places (e.g., Spain). In some regions, it will first fall before it rises. It is not clear how equation 3.2 is used across these cases, or how comparisons can be done between regions and time periods.
> -	These need to be scaled to be between 0 and 1, but most of them do not have natural upper and lower limits (e.g., mortality rate, growth rate, etc.). It is not clear how this was done in the case study, or how it is intended in the framework.
> -	I do not believe that the vast majority of these KPI can be evaluated under climate change or that the effects of adaptation solutions on them can be measured.
> -	Tables 3.2 – 3.6 list various KPI, but in the sole case study, most are not used and others not in this list are used. If these lists are “suggestions”, then why are they suggested?
> For the case study, 5 solutions to heat waves are listed in table 4.1, but only one solution scenario is explored. Presumably solutions are not “all or nothing”.
> No future year is ever identified for the future climate change scenarios.
> According to the various SSP scenarios, Greece will be 50% - 180% richer in the 2050 than it was in 2020. While there are rationales that might justify projecting lower levels of access to electricity or sanitation facilities under heat wave conditions, these are fairly tenuous against the clearer benefits of wealth. In the absence of further justifications, many of the values in tables 4.2 – 4.9 seem arbitrary and subjective.
> This work is meant to be informed by WP2, and that is included in the framework, but it is not included in the case study nor discussed in the construction of KPIs. 
> DSI is not an adaptation strategy. It is a step in a planning process, which may lead to some number adaptation policies (including none).
> Based on the proposal, an assessment of avoided pathways would be provided for each demonstrator, but it appears to only be done for MOE. Annex B identifies KPIs for 3 demonstrators and Annex C identifies solutions for 5 demonstrators, but the assessment is only reported for MOE.
> Why is it recommended that teams wishing to apply the framework start with identifying hazards? Often, stakeholders do not know which hazards matter most for outcomes they care about—for example, overemphasizing precipitation changes relative to other hazards that have clearer shifts. They can more readily be usefully engaged in discussions about outcomes of concern. 
> The most important steps, #8 and #9, seems oddly undefined. It is not clear how this was done in the case study, or how any local team would go about it. This requires consultation with a experts in a number of different areas and specific types of information to feed in, but none of that is laid out.
> D3.6	D20	Request for revision	The test case represents 0.0001% of the demonstrator region. This seems insufficient to extrapolate even the potential of the method to either Lappeenranta or other demonstrator regions.
> D3.7	D21	Accepted 	Structure follows reasonable best-practices in contexts where knowledge transfer is not needed. However, it is not clear how the group of 10 stakeholders will be equipped to all understand and evaluate the range of possible operational action plan actions.
> The meaning of ”impact levels” is not provided. What is being impacted by what? Upon what dimension are impacts rated as low or high? How could an impact change its impact level—over time, group, process, or something else? Figure 6 suggests that the authors are imagining impacts levels to refer to different degrees of climate impacts, but given that this is dependent upon adaptation practices, this application would also remain unclear. Section 3.3 suggests that it is adaptation actions that are being rated, but I do not know how.
> It should be clarified that the limited number of participants (target of 10) reflects embedded limitations of the work. A larger group of stakeholders is preferable, but would require a larger number of workshops and processes to translate across workshops. However, the project assigned limited resources, allowing only 10 stakeholders, and that also limits the applicability of this demonstration. 
> D3.8	D22	Accepted 	Lappeenranta: Based on their responses, the workshop participants appear to be managers of the relevant urban systems. As a result, they select adaptation pathways without need for coordination outside their sector (e.g., avoiding education and policy change), and tend to see policy-maker attitudes as the main barrier to broader change.
> Egaleo and Oristano: TransformAr partners performed the development and selection of the pathways for both of these demonstrators. The text suggests that the technical partner for the Municipality and stakeholders were involved in this step. Also, the impact levels and level thresholds are poorly defined in both cases. In the case of Oristano’s biodiversity KCS, there was also no stakeholder input to the action plans.
> D3.9	D23	Accepted 	Claims are made about how participants viewed the workshops (complete and exhaustive in D3.8) and materials (valued in D3.9), but no post-workshop survey appears to have been done.
> In 4.0, there appears to be a disconnect between the main differences in success across the demonstrators and the lessons learned. Observations are made about commonalities and differences, and best practices are set forth, but the best practices appear to just be the opinion of TransformAr. That is, the results of the analysis do not appear to be driven by the data. This is surprising, given the wide differences in success of different steps by the demonstrators.
> Similar to 4.0, in 5.0 several differences are identified, but in this case all demonstrators completed their task. In this case, I would think that only negative outcomes could be identified (i.e., that a given difference did not produce a difference in the success of the work).
> However, there were differences in the quality of the results, beyond the West Country challenges on types of actions. Presumably, if quality criteria (e.g., applicability, clarity, surveyed salience) were developed and applied, one would find that demonstrators had differences that could be used to inform “lessons learned”. Table 11 provides many more instances of difficulties, but these are not discussed in the text or used in the analysis.
> D4.3	D26	Accepted 	The “Key strategies for dissemination and scaling of NBS” section is central to the work of the project, but the approaches proposed to upscaling are insufficient: (1 – all three) demonstration is not an upscaling approach; (2 – Lappeenranta) standardization and adaptation requires multiple applied contexts; (3 – SW England) who will be expanding the market?
> The standardized information form appears to break down when multiple NBS are implemented (all three cases). As shown, the information for these are interleaved in the form, but there is not discussion of how they should interact or form a coherent combined NBS.
> The ”standardized form” appears to just consist of a collection of unstandardized fields. For example, there is no typology for “Type”, no quantification scheme for “Dimensions/Size”, and no standardization of what should be included in “Installation Requirements”.
> Cost does not provide information on operating and maintenance, or how much the costs reflect labor costs (potentially very variable if skilled labor is needed) and land opportunity cost. 
> D4.4	D27	Request for revision 	The report says that the full video is reported as expected to be released in October 2024, but it is unavailable until at least mid-February.
> D5.8	D30	Request for revision	MOE: Very few of the identified KPI will evaluate the success of the proposed solutions. Almost all are either driven by much larger macroeconomic features (e.g. unemployment rate), or climate hazards over which MOE has essential no control (e.g., accumulated precipitation). Most importantly, these do not evaluate the success of the solutions themselves; obvious KPIs such as usage levels of the SCS and CAE, and post-intervention surveys of the AWAR students, are completely missing.
> Lappeenranta: The choice experiment is not an intervention. Also, the indicator table (Table 6) mainly has intended outcomes, with hints of the indicators in the “units”. However, these are not sufficiently clear. There is a separate “Approach to monitor impacts” section, but it is not clear if it is related to the Flood Vulnerability column from Table 6.
> Oristano: (1) According to the document, the Coastal Contract was already developed, covering Oristano, in 2001. It appears that the work described as being under TransformAr was already within the scope of the existing agreement. (2) Seven SMART GATES are part of the NBS General Masterplan, only one of which is implemented by TransformAr. It is not explained why TransformAr’s contribution is significant. Also, the GATES themselves are not NBS, although to the extent that they are designed with the filter ecosystems (unclear), this could be classified as a hybrid project.
> D6.2	D40	Request for revision	The key benefits question is, how much of the damages will be avoided? Since the DCE assumes certain levels of damage reduction, it cannot inform that.
> The COACCH coastal adaptation data only account for engineering costs, not other kinds of adaptation costs. Also, the COACCH adaptation scenario (“incremental adaptation”) is essentially a business-as-usual adaptation, which does not seem to be in-line with the vision of the project or the DCE.
> It sounds like adaptation costs are reported per person in the whole country, but across each NUTS2 region. This cannot be used for a NUTS2-level benefit-cost ratio.
> The standard approach to translating WTP values to other regions assumes a linear-in-logs relationship, and nothing in the discussion justifies swapping that for a linear-in-levels relationship.
> Comparison of results: The WTP results reflect a private benefit, rather than the public benefit presumably of concern to policy-makers.
> Generally, this deliverable does not appear to satisfy the proposed outcomes. The WTP estimates are for generic reductions in damages, rather than any actual adaptation measures. The adaptation costs are only available for DIVA’s standard set of coastal practices. A proper CBA could have been done, using actual costs and either observed or specifically elicited WTP-based benefits, and then benefit transfer techniques used to extrapolate, but this was not done.

> ### Significant Results Linked to Dissemination, Exploitation, and Impact Potential
> 
> The TransformAr project has delivered several significant exploitable results during the second reporting period. Each of these results contributes to enhancing stakeholder engagement, building capacities, and facilitating the implementation of transformational adaptation pathways. Below are the key results:
> 
> 1. **Adaptation Pathways Framework**  
>    - **Type and Purpose of Result:** A comprehensive framework developed to guide stakeholders in co-creating and co-designing adaptation solutions tailored to specific contexts, particularly in water-energy-food systems.
>    - **Stakeholders:** Local governments, NGOs, policymakers, and community leaders in the six lighthouse demonstrators (LDs) and beyond.
>    - **Dissemination Channel:** The framework is made available through a combination of workshops, reports, and an interactive online platform. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues have been considered to encourage open access while protecting critical methodologies.
>    - **Expected Impact:** This framework is expected to enhance adaptive governance and supports the engagement of diverse stakeholders in the adaptation process, ultimately leading to more resilient community practices.
> 
> 2. **Data Repository of Climatic, Hydrological, and Environmental Data**  
>    - **Type and Purpose of Result:** An ensemble of high-quality datasets that characterize the climatic, hydrological, and environmental conditions relevant to the adaptation pathways.
>    - **Stakeholders:** Researchers, urban planners, climate scientists, and local communities who are engaged in adaptive strategies.
>    - **Dissemination Channel:** The data repository is accessible via the project’s online data portal, ensuring compliance with open data principles while addressing IPR concerns. 
>    - **Expected Impact:** This repository is anticipated to significantly enhance the understanding of local climate risks and inform evidence-based decision-making for both adaptation and mitigation strategies.
> 
> 3. **Playbook for Adaptation Strategies**  
>    - **Type and Purpose of Result:** A detailed 'playbook' that consolidates best practices, strategies, and lessons learned from the implementation of adaptation pathways across the six LDs.
>    - **Stakeholders:** Policymakers, city planners, and community organizations looking for practical guidance on implementing adaptation strategies.
>    - **Dissemination Channel:** The playbook is distributed through workshops, webinars, and digital platforms. The work is presented in a way that allows for reuse while ensuring that the underlying methodologies are appropriately attributed.
>    - **Expected Impact:** The playbook is expected to empower stakeholders by providing actionable steps and promoting the adoption of successful strategies in other regions or communities facing similar challenges.
> 
> 4. **Stakeholder Engagement Toolkit**  
>    - **Type and Purpose of Result:** A toolkit developed to standardize and optimize stakeholder engagement processes when devising and implementing adaptation pathways.
>    - **Stakeholders:** Project managers, NGOs, local government authorities, and community facilitators.
>    - **Dissemination Channel:** The toolkit is shared through training sessions, online webinars, and is available on the project’s website. Consideration for IPR is also managed to encourage broad uptake.
>    - **Expected Impact:** By facilitating better stakeholder involvement, the toolkit is projected to improve the quality of engagement and ultimately enhance the success of adaptation initiatives.
> 
> Overall, TransformAr has reinforced the importance of stakeholder engagement and knowledge sharing, leading to significant improvements in building adaptive capacity across various contexts. The consortium's ongoing efforts to boost dissemination through publications, workshops, and strategic collaborations will be central to realizing the project’s long-term impacts and ensuring that its outcomes are effectively utilized.
