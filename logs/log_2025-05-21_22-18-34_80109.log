> Abstract
> The specific needs of children – and the impacts of road design, traffic, and congestion on them – tend to be poorly addressed in transport planning, including in cities like Nairobi. While a growing body of research on the geography of education in African cities has delved into aspects of school travel, equity, and their effects on learning, the influence of school sessions, which induces unique trip dynamics, remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to address this gap through a data-driven analysis of traffic effects when schools are in session, compared to holidays in Nairobi. We leverage real-time road speed information from the publicly available Uber Movement data for 2019 to model congestion spatially and temporally. We achieve this by modeling travel times to the central business district (CBD) from across the city for both school term and holiday periods, as well as by measuring changes in mean daily and hourly road speeds across different road types between the two periods. Through this analysis, we found that mean road speeds across the city were statistically significantly lower during the school term than during the holiday period with secondary roads overrepresented among the most congested roads in the city. There was also high positive spatial autocorrelation for changes in travel times to the CBD across the city with some clusters experiencing significant increases in travel times while others experienced significant decreases. The high degree of clustering, decreased road speeds, and overburdening of specific road types suggests potential equity and economic impacts of congestion, which may be closely connected to inadequate land use and planning regarding children's education and school travel. Overall, this suggests that better planning for schools could help reduce congestion, while improving child health and well-being.

> 
> The paper explores how poor integration of school-related travel into urban transport planning contributes to traffic congestion in Nairobi. While the conventional response to congestion has focused on expanding road networks, other crucial aspects—such as public transport, pedestrian safety, and equitable access to education—are frequently neglected. As a result, many residents rely on private vehicles, intensifying congestion, especially during peak travel times.
> 
> To analyze the specific impact of school sessions on traffic, the researchers used 2019 Uber Movement data, which provides road speed information across Nairobi. They compared traffic conditions during school terms and holiday periods, focusing on changes in mean daily and hourly road speeds across different road types, and modeled travel times to the Central Business District (CBD) from various parts of the city.
> 
> Travel time analysis was conducted using openrouteservice, an open-source routing engine that utilizes OpenStreetMap data to model road networks. This tool allowed the researchers to calculate point-to-point travel times and routes, while also incorporating the Uber speed data to simulate realistic driving conditions. The flexibility of openrouteservice in supporting multiple mobility profiles and third-party data integration made it well-suited to capturing Nairobi’s diverse traffic dynamics.
> 
> The analysis revealed that road speeds were significantly lower during school terms, with congestion peaking in the morning rush hours (6am–9am). Secondary roads were particularly burdened, and spatial analysis showed that travel time changes were not evenly distributed—some neighborhoods experienced large increases, while others saw decreases. These patterns were especially pronounced in wealthier wards, where families are more likely to drive children to distant, higher-quality schools.
> 
> Ultimately, the study highlights how the spatial mismatch between students’ homes and school locations, along with the lack of safe and reliable shared school transport, drives up vehicle volumes during term time. These findings emphasize the need for integrated land-use and transport planning that prioritizes school accessibility, non-motorized mobility, and investment in public and school transport systems to address congestion and promote equitable urban development.

>    Urban congestion is a familiar challenge, particularly in bustling cities like Nairobi. While expanding roads has been a traditional response, this often overlooks critical elements like public transport and equitable access. Our new paper delves into how school travel can uniquely influence traffic patterns and exacerbate congestion challenges.
> 
>    In this study, we utilized 2019 Uber Movement data to scrutinize traffic conditions during school terms versus holiday periods. This data-centric approach unveiled a notable drop in road speeds during school sessions, with secondary roads experiencing the brunt of congestion. Importantly, our spatial analysis showed distinct patterns in travel time changes, often correlating with socioeconomic disparities.
> 
>    By integrating data from openrouteservice, we modeled realistic travel scenarios, revealing that affluent areas faced heightened traffic as families drove to quality schools located farther from home. This disconnect underscores the pressing need for integrated planning that prioritizes school access, non-motorized transport, and robust public systems to alleviate traffic woes and promote equitable urban growth.
