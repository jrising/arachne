>  Keywords for Building Relationships in Lenape and Nanticoke Homelands
> University of Delaware Anti-Racism Initiative American Indian and Indigenous Relations Committee
> Rationale:
> The Keywords project provides transparent and accountable language to support relationship-building among members of University of Delaware and Indigenous peoples. We focus on Lenape and Nanticoke in the Delaware watersheds, those forcibly displaced from this region, and other American Indians dispossessed through the University’s land grant history. This document defines a wide array of terms associated with these groups and their colonization, including language used in the committee’s Living Land Acknowledgement, Institutional Action Steps, and Land Grant History. Having language in common creates a foundation for dialogue and collective action. Yet our various constituencies do not necessarily share the same vocabulary or meanings for the same words. Our selection of keywords balances current best practices in the academic field of Indigenous Studies with the preferred language of American Indian communities with whom we are in dialogue.
> We developed the entries specific to Nanticoke and Lenape through consultation, whenever possible, to support self-representation. In cases when our outreach has not been successful to date, we drew upon each group’s public facing documents and other research materials. Our intention is to include all tribal groups on their terms, including federally-recognized, state-recognized, and unrecognized collectives, in order to avoid positioning ourselves as arbiters of identity. However, we have come to understand that there is no neutral position because of significant divisions among federally-recognized, state-recognized, and unrecognized groups. When we have encountered divergent positions, terms, and definitions, we have attempted to make these differences visible.
> While the Keywords predominantly utilize English, we have included some Nanticoke and Lenape terms. The erasure of Indigenous languages is an essential tactic of colonization, furthering the eradication and assimilation of the original stewards of North America in order to usurp land. As the Keywords evolve, we aim to cite more Nanticoke and Lenape terms in tandem with language revitalization projects underway in these communities.

> We consulted with representatives of the Ramapo Munsee Lenape Nation, the Lenape Indian Tribe of Delaware, the Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania, and the Nanticoke Indian Tribe. We communicated with the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation, who expressed general approval of the Keywords content. We spoke with the Six Nations of the Grand River; however, they were unable to find a consultant with knowledge of the Delaware of the Six Nations. We spoke with representatives from the Delaware Nation in Anadarko, Oklahoma, the Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and the Lenape Center in New York; these groups declined formal consultation. The Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians declined because they do not acknowledge state-recognized or unrecognized groups and take issue with the inclusion of these groups in our document. In some cases where group-specific entries were neither provided nor approved by representatives of those groups, we drew language from their website, as our footnotes make clear. Our readers should recognize that information coming from a group or a group’s website does not necessarily reflect the perspective of all Nanticoke or Lenape. This is a living document and further input from tribal nations is always welcome.

The Lunaapeew originally lived on land in present-day New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Early treaties with the Dutch (1600s) and United States (1778) were not honored by the Dutch and Americans, forcing the Lunaapeew to move to Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Ontario. The Lunaapeew joined Moravian missionaries for protection from ongoing wars and violence, together building 30 villages known as “Morovian Towns” from 1740 to 1815. However, the Lunaapeew were still persecuted, including the horrific American militia massacre of over 90 Lunaapeew in Gnadenhutten, Ohio. It is believed that this massacre led the Lunaapeew towards Canada, where they petitioned the Canadian government for land in southwest Ontario. Their original settlement, founded in 1792, was located on the north side of the Thames River but was burned down by American soldiers after the war of 1812.

> Delaware Nation in Anadarko, Oklahoma*
> Delaware Nation is one of multiple federally recognized sovereign tribal nations of Lenape people today, whose homelands encompassed what are now called Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and parts of New York since time immemorial. Delaware Nation’s tribal government now operates out of Anadarko, Oklahoma as a result of longstanding settler colonial violence and broken treaties beginning as early as the 16th and 17th centuries which ultimately forced the Lenape people out of their homelands. In 1778, after being pushed west into Ohio territory, Lenape leaders entered into the first treaty made between a tribal nation and the new United States: the Treaty of Fort Pitt, which helped the Americans to win the Revolutionary War. This promised the Lenape new lands to live on, representation in Congress, and a sovereign state within the new nation, but the United States did not uphold their end of this treaty. Over the next few centuries, the governing bodies of Lenape people were repeatedly fractured and forced further from their homelands along a trail of broken treaties, resulting in the multiple federally recognized Lenape tribal nations which exist today. Delaware Nation’s specific removal history follows a land grant they received from the Governor General of Louisiana, which resulted in their splitting from the group of Lenape that would become the Delaware Tribe of Indians (Bartlesville, OK). As a result, Delaware Nation became known as “the Absentee Delaware” and began moving south through Texas before eventually settling on allotments in Anadarko, Oklahoma, renaming themselves as the Delaware Tribe of Western Oklahoma and eventually the Delaware Nation, as they are known today. Despite enduring centuries of forced removals, broken treaties, and persecution as a result of settler colonialism, Delaware Nation maintained their sovereignty and ongoing relationship with their homelands. Today, Delaware Nation operates an extension historic preservation office in Bethlehem, PA in addition to their tribal headquarters in order to facilitate their ongoing management of and consultation in their homeland region.7

> Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville, Oklahoma
> The Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville, Oklahoma are Lenape whose ancestors lived along the Delaware River. In 1737 the sons of William Penn sold 1200 square miles of Lenape-owned land to pay off their creditors by presenting the Lenape people with a fake deed and falsely declaring that Lenape ancestors gave this land to the Penns. After 130 years of trekking westward, and many broken promises from the federal government of a permanent home, these Lenape were finally able to settle in Oklahoma. Much of the Delaware Tribe of Indians' rich knowledge, traditions, and cultural practices were lost along this long trek.9 See entry for The Walking Purchase.

>  the 1600s and 1700s. Europeans continued, despite these agreements, to seize Indigenous homelands. Privatization of Nanticoke and Lenape homelands disrupted seasonal hunting patterns and endangered their communities. Many were displaced beginning in the mid 1700s, after a century of violence. Today, state-recognized Lenape and Nanticoke groups in Delaware and New Jersey and a nonprofit organization in Pennsylvania assert their kinship and cultural continuity with Lenape and Nanticoke who stayed behind or returned to the homelands.
> Displaced Lenape communities exist in Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Kansas, Ontario, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Missouri. The federally recognized Lenape tribal nations are: Delaware Nation (Anadarko Oklahoma); Delaware Tribe of Indians (Bartlesville Oklahoma); and the Stockbridge Munsee Community (Bowler Wisconsin) in the United States; and the Munsee Delaware Nation and the Eelūnaapèewii Lahkèewiit (Delaware Nation at Moraviantown), both in Ontario Canada. Despite enduring centuries of forced removals, broken treaties, and persecution as a result of settler colonialism, the federally recognized nations have maintained their sovereignty and ongoing cultural relationships with their homelands. Though they operate under their own separate governments today, they acknowledge each other as relations and frequently work together on initiatives affecting all Lenape people. Delaware Nation, Delaware Tribe of Indians, and Stockbridge Munsee Community also all have extension historic preservation offices in their homeland region in addition to their tribal headquarters. Several of the Lenape tribal nations have issued official governmental proclamations that they do not acknowledge or work with any non-federally recognized groups or individuals claiming Lenape identity.

>  Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania*
> The Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania (LNPA) is currently a non-recognized nation of descendants of the Lenape people registered as a 501(c)3 non-profit. Their ancestral homelands include all of the Lenapehokink. The LNPA keeps tribal traditions and customs, educates the public about Lenape history and presence, works to revitalize Lenape culture and language, and stewards Lenapehokink through initiatives like the quadrennial Rising Nation River Journey. While many Lenape people who inhabited Delaware, New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania and Southern New York prior to European colonization were removed and dispersed from their homeland, many Lenape families remained in Pennsylvania and carry on the traditions of their ancestors to this day. Many locations in Pennsylvania are named from the Lenape language, including Manayunk, Conshohocken, and Neshaminy.16 See entry for Lenapehoking.
> Munsee
> Munsee (or Minsi, “People of the Stone Country”) is a language that originated in communities living in the northern part of Lenapehoking.17 Munsee has been preserved by Lenape in Ontario and Wisconsin and is now taught through language revitalization programs. The Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians are currently compiling a dictionary and the Delaware Nation at Moraviantown have been working on language restoration. Unami, Unalachtigo and Munsee are distinct but related languages from Lenapehoking.

They were encouraged by the Lieutenant Governor to settle where the Chippewa were already established. The Munsee and the Chippewa reached an agreement to share the land in 1840, and in 1967 a Munsee portion of the Chppewa of the Thames reserve was established.

> State-recognized tribal association with headquarters in Millsboro, Delaware. It received legal recognition from the Delaware State Assembly in 1881 when the Nanticoke nation founded a Nanticoke school on Nanticoke land. Descendants of smaller Nanticoke communities joined together due to pressures of colonization to form a larger tribal association. The Tribe’s flag bears the words “Halac'quow Ewapaw'gup Allappah'wee” (Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow) to symbolize Nanticoke resilience in the past, in the present, and in the future.20

> Powhatan Renape Nation
> A nation whose people descend from an ancient confederation that previously included over thirty nations. Their ancestors were mostly Rappahannocks from Virginia and Nanticokes from Delaware. Many of the Powhatan Confederacy still survive, despite war, disease and cultural disintegration brought on by European settlers. Renape, which translates to “human beings,” refers to the group’s ethnic/language identity, while Powhatan refers to the group’s political identity. The Renape people are not all united as one nation and have governed themselves as independent republics which formed alliances and confederations, such as the Powhatan Confederacy. The Powhatan Renape Nation was recognized by the State of New Jersey in 1876 and holds over 350 acres of land in the town of Westhampton, known as the Rankokus Indian Reservation.22
> Ramapo Munsee Lenape Nation*
> Ramapo-Munsee Lenape Nation’s ancestral and ceremonial homelands once stretched from western Connecticut to eastern Pennsylvania and from the northern banks of the Raritan River in New Jersey to Albany, New York. Their ancestors were forced to take refuge in the mountains of what is now known as Mahwah, NJ. As the Revolutionary War began, the Ramapough [Dutch spelling] withdrew from the Iroquois Confederacy to support the revolutionists, and without question, the greatest gift the Ramapough gave was to allow for the stationing of some 5000 French troops in the Ramapo [English spelling] Pass. This tactically assured the success of the American Revolution in the New England colonies. Subsequently, between 1680 and 1722, Sachem Katonah [Catonah] of the Tankiteke Sachemdom was petitioned by the courts to relinquish the remaining land, including the village of Ramapoo, which is now Bedford, Connecticut; as a result, the Ramapoo involuntarily relocated to Mahwah, New Jersey. In 1856, James DeClark named the town of Nanuet, NJ after Nanuwitt, a Ramapo Indian, and by the year 2000, the United States Census Bureau listed the Ramapough homeland as an American Indian statistical area. Correspondingly, in the most recent chronographic and progressive turn of events, the Ramapo-Munsee have been gifted the return of a 285 year-old land use deed by the Sloat family descendants on June 4th, 2022 followed by the historic transfer of the

Currently, the Ramapo Munsee Lenape Nation is sustained on a small section of their homeland in the foothills of the Ramapo mountains, also known as the Ramapo Pass. The Ramapo are known as the “Keepers of the Pass.” This nation is state-recognized by New Jersey and by the United States Congress through a resolution sponsored by the New York State delegation.23 The nation is defined by its continuing relationship to the original homelands of the Munsee people and is welcoming of people from diverse backgrounds throughout the planet. The Ramapough River, known as"Sweetwater," is the historic gateway to the interior of the Continent. 24 See entry for Munsee.
> Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians in Bowler, Wisconsin
> The Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians are Mohican and Munsee, both part of the Lenape, whose territory extends across six states including southwest Vermont, the Hudson River Valley of New York, western Massachusetts, northwest Connecticut, and portions of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Mohican people, meaning The People of the Waters that Are Never Still, traveled eastward from the north and the south, eventually settling on the Mahicannituck river (also known as the Hudson River). As the Mohican people expanded their territory eastward they became affiliated with the Munsee. Conflict with European traders drove the Mohican people to a village that was later named Stockbridge. Through European missionary teachings, people of the Wappingers, the Niantics, Brothertons, Tunxis, Pequot, Mohawk, Narragansetts and Oneidas came together and became known as the Stockbridge Indians. Eventually land lost through debt, deals, and fraudulent means forced the Stockbridge Indians to move westward, leading to tragic losses of life, land, and culture. They eventually settled in Stockbridge, Wisconsin and became known as Stockbridge-Munsee. A reservation was established under the Act of 1871, which was subject to allotment under the 1887 General Allotment Act. Today, the name Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians is used to acknowledge the people’s history and tribal sovereignty.25 See entries for allotment, the Dawes Act of 1877, and Munsee.

The terms Native American or Native are often used interchangeably with American Indian and Alaska Native.
> bandolier bags
> Lenape women began making shoulder bags that reflected their growing participation in global trade networks in the nineteenth century. Known as bandolier bags, these items are based on longstanding Lenape arts made from animal skins and decorated with porcupine quillwork that references the cosmologies and ecologies of Lenapehoking. However, they are distinguished by their incorporation of silk, wool, cotton, ribbons, beads, bells, buttons, and other materials manufactured by Euro-Americans. When worn, these dazzling artworks may shimmer in the light and make a tinkling sound. They express the creativity and resilience of Lenape amid their forced displacement from the eastern seaboard.30
> Bureau of Indian Affairs
> The federal government established the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 1824 to manage trade and treaty relationships with American Indians; it was later enshrined in legislation by Congress in 1832. As the federal government removed many American Indian peoples from their homelands, the BIA oversaw programs to assimilate American Indian communities. Some of these initiatives included forcing communities to adopt private property and compelling them to produce commodities for the market economy. As of April 2022, there are 574 federally-recognized nations to whom the BIA provides services directly or through contracts, grants, or compacts.31

> The systematic destruction and erasure of one group’s language, values, traditions, and beliefs by another group. In short, cultural genocide names the elimination of knowledges and practices that allow a group to continue as a group.

> The Dawes Act of 1887
> The Dawes Act served as a legal basis for the United States to appropriate 90 million acres of Native land. This is commonly referred to as land theft. Also known as the “General Allotment Act,” the Dawes Act required Native-held land to be broken up among individual members of Native nations. Any “surplus” land was then opened to white settlers, which often included the most productive land in the former reservation. Native people were denied the protections of United States citizenship unless they accepted the division of Native-held lands. The act allowed the federal government to retain title of Native-held land in “trust” because it declared Native

> decolonization
> Settler colonialism has led to the widespread occupation of land seized from Native communities as well as sustained attempts to assimilate Native peoples into the cultural, economic, and political systems of the dominant nation. Decolonization names the process of restoring Indigenous peoples’ autonomy from settler colonial governance, including the return of their land and political sovereignty. See entry for settler colonialism.
> Delaware*
> What is now known as the state of Delaware is the traditional home of Lenape and Nanticoke. While the name “Delaware” is now used interchangeably with Lenape, and is used by many of today’s federally recognized Lenape nations, it is actually a European term. The Lenape were collectively referred to as the “Delaware” by European colonists because of their proximity to the Delaware River, which Europeans had named after their first governor of the Province of Virginia: Thomas West, third Baron De La Warr. Although “Delaware” was historically imposed upon the Lenape people by colonists, the federally-recognized nations continue to use it in their official titles to uphold treaties which utilized the same terminology.

> dispossession
> Following the displacement of Native peoples from their land, settler colonial governments used various means to transfer the rights to that land to settlers.

> Doctrine of Discovery*
> The doctrine of discovery refers to an international legal principle that when a nation “discovers” land, it gains the rights to that land regardless of the people already living on it. This principle originated in early modern Europe, when Papal Bulls (decrees issued by the pope of the Catholic Church) were used to justify the conquest and colonization of non-Christian Indigenous peoples in Africa and the Americas. 35 In 1823, the Doctrine of Discovery informed Chief Justice John Marshall's Supreme Court decision in Johnson v. M'Intosh that “discovery gave title to government...[and] the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives," justifying continued dispossession of Indigenous lands in America.36 See entries for dispossession, settler, and settler colonialism.

> As of April 2022, the United States government recognizes 574 tribal nations as sovereign entities. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Federal Acknowledgement (OFA)40 oversees the recognition process. Tribes can gain recognition through the Federal Acknowledgement process, by an act of Congress, or through a decision of a United States court.41 There are stringent requirements for a petitioning tribe to obtain federal recognition status, including (but not limited to) identification as an American Indian group and a distinct community which has maintained political influence over its members as an autonomous entity from 1900 to the present.42 Federally-recognized tribes are eligible to receive funding and services from the US government, including preservation of historic sites and artifacts and housing resources.43 Some federally-recognized tribes view their status not as “bestowed upon them” but rather as confirmed by the United States government, through historic precedence as well as ongoing government-to-government consultation about the management of their homelands and other business.

>  Indian boarding schools*
> In Canada and the United States, as part of federal policies of forced assimilation that began in the nineteenth century, Indigenous children were removed from their communities and sent to schools, where they suffered criminal neglect and abuse. In the United States, the 1819 Indian Civilization Fund Act provided funding for Christian missionaries and federal agents to found schools aimed at “civilizing” children by replacing Indigenous knowledge with Christian knowledge, with the ultimate goal of eliminating military resistance to settlement. School officials punished students for speaking any language other than English and for practicing their Indigenous cultures. In Canada, churches and religious groups funded by the government ran the Residential Schooling System, which taught at least 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children. Much like in the United States, these schools were designed to suppress Indigenous cultures, identities, and histories.49 In recent years, researchers have begun identifying unmarked graves near many schools in both the United States and Canada.50 The Bureau of Indian Affairs determined that Nanticoke and Lenape children would be sent to Haskell boarding school (established in 1884, now Haskell Indian Nations University) in Kansas. Given that the state of Delaware sought to eliminate American Indian identities, some Nanticoke saw this as an opportunity to provide their children with a higher education and reinforce their Indian status. The true abusive conditions at the school were likely not known to the families of the attendees.51 All federally-funded residential boarding schools were closed in 1978 in the United States and 1997 in Canada. See entries for cultural genocide, Moor, and Indian Welfare Act, 1978.

>  Indian Welfare Act, 1978
> In 1969 and 1974, the Association of American Indian Affairs found that between 25-35% of Native children were being separated from their families through adoption, foster care, and residential boarding schools.52 In response to the growing Native self-determination movements in the 1960s and 1970s, The Indian Welfare Act of 1978 closed federal boarding schools, strengthened the rights of Native courts, and set stricter standards for the removal of children from their communities. The Act, despite recognizing the failure of federal and state courts, maintained a paternalistic model that emphasized the role of the United States as a “trustee” with “direct interest” in the welfare of Native children. See entries for Indian boarding schools and self-determination.

> land-grab university
> Land-grab universities are universities which received land or scrip under the Morrill Act of 1862. Reporters Robert Lee and Tristan Ahtone defined the term “land-grab university” in 2020 when High Country News published an expose detailing how the appropriation of nearly 11 million acres of Indigenous land funded land-grant universities of the United States.59 The University of Delaware had been shuttered for several years due to lack of funds and was only able to re-open in 1870 after receiving scrip, which it in turn sold. The term land-grab serves as a critique of the Morrill Act; in contrast to the federally designated term “land-grant institution,” the word “grab” emphasizes that university wealth was built through the dispossession of Indigenous lands, at great cost to Indigenous lives and livelihoods.

> The Morrill Act (Land Grant Act) of 1862
> In 1862, the same year as the better-known Homestead Act, the federal government passed the Morrill Act. The Act promised to give states between 90,000 and 990,000 acres, determined by the size of their congressional delegation. The sale of the land by a state would fund colleges in that state “for the benefit of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts and a Military Tactics Department.” 65 States without any public lands in the East, Midwest, and South received scrip for land surveyed in the public domain. Western states chose parcels of land within their own borders. Once territories achieved statehood, they were included in the act. All of the land “granted” to universities was formerly Indigenous land. The federal government dispossessed Indigenous nations through treaties, both ratified and unratified, and outright land seizure. See entries for land-grab university, land-grant institution, ratified, scrip, and treaty.
> nation*
> While the term “nation” has European roots, Indigenous groups practiced similar systems of governance prior to European contact, such as the formation of confederacies and establishing treaties. Many Indigenous groups in the United States have adopted the term “nation” to assert their status as sovereign polities and have adapted the term to their own traditions of governance.66 See entries for sovereignty and treaty.
> the one drop rule*
> The one drop rule was a principle that anyone with “one drop” of Black ancestry was considered Black in the United States, codified by laws in southern states in the early 20th century. Among other things, this rule served to erase American Indian identities

> The Pocahontas Exception*
> The Pocahontas Exception allowed anyone with 1/64th American Indian ancestry, and no Black ancestry, to be considered White. This served as an amendment to the 1924 Racial Integrity Act in Virginia and was later adopted by Delaware and other states. Anyone with one sixteenth or more of Black ancestry would be considered Black and anyone with one sixteenth or more of Indian ancestry would be considered Indian. The Pocahontas Exception was added to address concerns of the many descendants of Pocahontas (also known by the names Amonute and Matoaka) and John Rolfe, who at that point were part of the wealthy land-owning white community of Virginia.68 See entries for the one drop rule and race.
> powwow
> Celebration of Native culture and sovereignty where people from diverse nations come together to dance, sing, and honor their ancestors. The term comes from the word Pau Wau (“medicine man”) in Narrtick, a language spoken by Algonquin people in what is now Massachusetts.69 Contemporary powwows are held across Indian Country and abroad. See entries for Indian Country and sovereignty.
> protocol
> A protocol is a system that defines appropriate procedures and conduct for a given situation. Protocols vary among different Indigenous communities and often differ from Euro-American behaviors and customs. Learning Indigenous protocols can guide respectful interactions with Indigenous communities in a variety of contexts, from ceremonies to diplomacy.70

>  race*
> Tribal citizenship is a political status, not a racial one.71 Native Nations did not racialize their citizenship prior to European contact, and tribal citizens today often have a diversity of ethnic backgrounds. Since the nineteenth century, the U.S. federal and state governments have racialized Lenape and Nanticoke to eliminate them as sovereign peoples. Race is a construct, or set of ideas, developed to enable and perpetuate Euro-American colonialism and conquest. Enlightenment thinkers posited that race had a biological basis through the study of scientific fictions like phrenology.72 Race re-defined who was seen as fully human in Euro-American worldviews based on the physical trait of skin color and other phenotypic characteristics, and therefore who was deserving of dignity and political rights. The academic discourse of Critical Race Studies uses “race” to analyze systems of domination in their historical contexts rather than to refer to an inherent trait of an individual or group. See entries for blood quantum, Indian boarding school, Moor, and the one drop rule.
> ratified/unratified
> In United States law, once a treaty has been signed, the U.S. Senate must approve or ratify that treaty for it to become binding. Many treaties between the United States and Indigenous nations were never ratified. See entry for treaty.
> scrip
> A scrip represents a claim to a 160-acre parcel of public land distributed to states under the Morrill Act of 1862. Each state designated a land-grant university and gifted it scrips, which could be sold to fund the university’s endowments. Land-grant universities could sell the right to scrips, even if they did not directly sell the land itself, as was the case with Delaware College (as the University of Delaware was then called). Some schools used scrips to engage in further land speculation. See entries for land-grab university, land-grant institution, land speculation, and the Morrill Act of 1862.

>  The meaning of self-determination varies across different Native nations’ use of the term. Broadly, it designates Native nations’ right to self-governance, or the ability to direct their communal political, economic, cultural, and environmental relations.
> settler
> Refers to a non-Indigenous person living in Indigenous homelands occupied by a settler colonial government, such as the United States and Canada. Not all settlers included in this definition have benefited from settler colonialism. Many groups in the United States, such as Black, Asian, Latinx, and others, have suffered exploitation by the same Euro-American colonial systems that have displaced Native nations and profited from their homelands. Some argue that people whose ancestors were forced to migrate through slavery or other exploitative means should not be referred to as settlers.73 See entry for settler colonialism.
> settler colonialism
> Settler colonialism is an ongoing system that disposes Indigenous peoples and erases their cultures. A colonizing power seizes Native land, eliminates (through genocide, assimilation, or displacement) Native people, and replaces them with settlers. Settler colonialism continues today through official policies and unofficial practices that endanger Native people and cultures.74 See entries for displacement, genocide, and settler.
> sovereignty
> Sovereignty is a European term that Indigenous peoples have adopted to assert their nationhood, including their rights to both political and cultural self-determination. The U.S. constitution sets forth three sovereigns: the federal government, the states, and Indian Tribes. Tribal sovereignty was first recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Worcester v. Georgia (1832). The federal government formally recognizes some tribal entities as sovereign, while still treating them as domestic dependents subject to many powers of the U.S. government.75 Native nations often use the concept of sovereignty in excess of Euro-American jurisprudence.76 See entry for nation.

>  state recognition*
> States can formally recognize a tribe, usually through legislative action or via an act from a state’s Indian Commission. Unlike federal recognition, state recognition does not guarantee federal funding and services (although some federally-recognized tribes are also state-recognized). However, in some cases state recognition qualifies a tribe for federal and state support through agencies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Small Business Administration.77 See entries for federal recognition and sovereignty.
> traditional knowledge
> Traditional knowledge refers to the collective expertise Native communities have gained from a long-term relationship with their homelands. Oral tradition is the basis of traditional knowledge, which makes Native language integral to the resurgence and continuation of communal culture, government, and spirituality.
> treaty
> tribe
> Between 1778 and 1871, the United States negotiated agreements with Native nations to establish territorial boundaries and mutual responsibilities, known as treaties. The first treaty in 1778 was made with Lenape. The United States Senate ratified 370 treaties with tribes, while at least 45 treaties were never ratified. The United States ended treaty negotiations with American Indians in 1871, after which relationships were formalized through Congressional Acts, Executive Orders, and Executive Agreements.78 The federal government has repeatedly overturned and transgressed the treaty rights of American Indians, although many treaties remain in effect today. See entry for ratified/unratified.
> A tribe is a group of people who share a common ancestry, culture and language, often living together in a common space and composed of numerous families.79 In the context of the United States, tribe refers to an organized community of American Indians that may or may not be formally recognized by federal or state governments.80

>  Some criticize the term tribe as a word that colonizers used to portray notions of 'uncivilized’ or “primitive” societies.81 Some Indigenous groups in North America have incorporated “tribe” into their proper name, while others prefer nation, band, pueblo, community, people, or another term. See entries for state recognition and federal recognition.
> Truth and Reconciliation Commission
> Since the 1970s, Truth and Reconciliation commissions have become a global mechanism for transitional justice, used to bring an end to periods of violence that threaten to delegitimize a nation-state. A president/prime minister or legislative branch/parliament can mandate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the causes and consequences of the mass human rights violations in question, to construct a national truth narrative that acknowledges the past, and to provide a space for reconciliation between the perpetrators and survivors. Canada established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2007 that facilitates reconciliation for former students, families and communities impacted by Canada’s Indian Residential School system, including providing funding and support for those affected to share their story and educate the public.82 The United States has yet to mandate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address any aspect of the colonization of Native Americans. See entries for Indian boarding schools and settler colonialism.

These groups may assert their own identity and sovereignty outside of the recognition process. Preferred terminology differs across individuals and communities and includes currently unrecognized and unacknowledged. See entries for federal recognition, sovereignty, and state recognition.

**assistant**:
> Certainly, refining the existing text and incorporating the information about the state-recognized tribes, the Nanticoke Indian Museum, and federally recognized tribes originally from Delaware but now located elsewhere will provide a more comprehensive overview. Here's an edited and expanded version of the section:
> 
> ---
> 
> Delaware's Native American cultures are rich and diverse, encompassing the histories and legacies of multiple tribes with deep connections to the land. Among those, the three state-recognized tribes stand out: the Lenape Indian Tribe of Delaware, the Nanticoke Indian Tribe, and the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation. Each of these tribes contributes uniquely to Delaware's indigenous heritage, maintaining their traditions, languages, and cultural practices amidst modern challenges.
> 
> A key institution in preserving and showcasing Nanticoke heritage is the Nanticoke Indian Museum located in Millsboro, Delaware. As Delaware's only Native American museum, it plays a vital role in educating the public about the Nanticoke tribe's history, culture, and continuing contributions to the state. This museum, designated as a National Historic Landmark, holds numerous artifacts and provides insightful programming that bridges past and present Native American experiences in Delaware and the surrounding regions.
> 
> Moreover, the histories of Delaware's indigenous communities do not stop at state boundaries. Federally recognized tribes, such as the Delaware Nation in Anadarko, Oklahoma, and the Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, trace their origins back to the Delaware region before forced relocations moved them westward. Acknowledging these tribes shines a light on the broader narrative of displacement and resilience that characterizes much of Native American history in the United States.
> 
> The extensive Archaeological Collection in Delaware, containing over 4 million Native American artifacts, offers a tangible link to the past, revealing Delaware’s indigenous communities' adaptation and evolution from the Late Ice Age to European contact. Displayed across various state museums and cultural institutions, these artifacts narrate the diverse and enduring legacy of Delaware’s First Peoples.
> 
> Highlighting the need for ongoing research and data transparency, Trice et al. (2021) emphasize the importance of gathering comprehensive data on tribal and historical cultural activities. This includes the necessity for updated and publicly accessible information about Tribal Protected Areas and resources protected under the National Historic Preservation Act. Such efforts are crucial for recognizing and safeguarding the rights and sacred spaces of Native American communities in Delaware and beyond.
> 
> In sum, Delaware's indigenous heritage, as represented by its state-recognized tribes, the Nanticoke Indian Museum, and connections to tribes now residing outside the state, forms an integral part of the state's cultural fabric. Enhancing the visibility and understanding of these communities' past and current activities is essential for informed spatial planning and fostering a respectful and collaborative future.
