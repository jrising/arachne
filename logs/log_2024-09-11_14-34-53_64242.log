> **Value Added**: This refers to the value that a company or sector adds to the raw materials and intermediate goods it uses in its production process. It's essentially the contribution of labor and capital to production. In terms of an Input-Output (IO) model, value added typically includes wages, profits, rents, and taxes minus subsidies. It's a measure of the economic value a sector contributes to the overall economy and is directly related to GDP.

> A simple analogy might be to think of value added as the "extra value" a cake shop creates. If you imagine the cake ingredients purchased for $5 and the cake is sold for $15, the value added by the shop is $10. This value added covers the wages of the bakers, the rent for the shop, the owner's profit, etc.
> 
> **Profits**: This is a narrower concept and refers specifically to the financial gain a company or individual makes after all expenses have been deducted from revenue. Using the cake shop analogy, profits would be what's left for the owner after paying for the ingredients, wages, rent, and any other expenses.

> To communicate value added in lay terms, you might say that it represents the total economic contribution of a sector, including all wages and profits, rather than just the profit margins alone. This measure gives a fuller picture of economic impact, especially when modeling the interconnections in an economy using an IO model.
