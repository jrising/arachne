> I would like you to develop the form questions for this, using multiple choice and I will be implementing this with Google Form's conditional direction to different sections based on the responses. The form should provide explanation as it goes, and ultimately end with information about a particular program and an automatic email sent to one of us to evaluate the outcome. It should also be fairly short, to minimize the busy work for good candidates, while also ensuring that most people (who do not end up being good candidates, because of lack of funding or quantitative skills mostly) realize this.

> Here are some notes on specific pathways that should be explored for the students:
>  - Are they interested in a social science or natural science degree?
>  - If social science, are they a better fit for marine policy (MP) (more qualitative, less defined) or environmental economics (EE) (quantitative)?
>  - If EE, we want to know if they have the necessary quantitative background. For this, we need them to upload the transcripts and specify if they have had microeconomics, calculus, statistics, and/or programming.
>  - For ESM students, EE Masters, and MP Masters students, they need to be self-funding.
>  - For people interested in pursing PhD programs, we want to check if they satisfy the qualifications for the GSA award (I'll have the text, mainly whether they are a minority; this must be self-reported).
>  - For the final page for MP and EE PhD, there will be a list of research interests where they are requested to identify the closest (and each of those will auto-send to a different faculty member). Also on that page, we could collect other information on their research interests.
>  - Anything else that seems necessary to communicate or evaluate, given the text above.

**user**:
> Sorry, this isn't as developed as I was looking for. First, I want you to provide more explanation (the students won't necessarily know if they want a social science or natural science degree-- we run the policy degrees but get emails from biological science students all the time). That explanation should show up both in the section headings-- why are we asking these questions-- and in the question answers-- what do they mean? You probably also want to offer more options that are easier to understand, and then we can understand them as social vs. natural science.
> 
> Second, we don't want to ask them what program they want by name; we want to ask them what *kind* of program they want. Like, are they looking to learn how to do research? That sounds like they want a PhD.
> 
> Please incorporate more of the material and logic from the original email response text.
**assistant**:
> Absolutely! Here’s a more detailed version of the form that includes explanations to help guide respondents through the decision process and focuses on the type of program they might be interested in rather than specific names. This version weighs the distinctions between social science and natural science, as well as the different aims of various programs.
