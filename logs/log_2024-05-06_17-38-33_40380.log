> How should I interpret coefficients from a poisson regression. In my case, the dependent variable is a number of cases per day, and the independent variable is daily temperature.

> In a Poisson regression model, the coefficients represent the change in the log of the expected count for a one-unit change in the predictor, assuming all other variables are held constant.

> Applied to your case, if the coefficient for temperature (let's symbolize this as β_temp) is positive, this means that as temperature increases by 1 unit (typically 1 degree), the log of the expected number of cases per day increases by β_temp. If β_temp is negative, a one-unit increase in temperature leads to a decrease in the log of the expected number of cases per day.
> 
> To translate this into more interpretable terms - an increase or decrease in the expected count itself - you can exponentiate the coefficient. For example, if β_temp equals 0.2, e^(0.2) = 1.22 would correspond to a 22% increase in the expected number of cases for a one-unit increase in temperature, with all other variables held constant.
