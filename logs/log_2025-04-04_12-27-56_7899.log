**assistant**:
> The issue you're encountering arises from the scoping of variables within the parallelization framework. Each worker in a parallel computing environment in R has its own separate workspace and does not automatically share variables or the environment from the master process.
> 
> To fix this issue with `trade.method` (and potentially other variables), you need to explicitly pass these variables to the functions or scripts that need them. Since your script `src/lib/utils2.R` is expecting `trade.method` to be globally available but is being run in an isolated environment, here's how you could address it:
> 
> 1. **Modify the script to accept parameters:** Update the functions within `src/lib/utils2.R` to accept `trade.method` and other necessary variables as arguments.
> 
> 2. **Pass the variables correctly:** Ensure that the necessary variables are being passed to the functions within your script. You can do this by modifying how you call the functions in that script after sourcing it.
> 
> Here's an outline of how you could pass `trade.method` as an argument:
> 
> ```r
> parLapply(cl, configs, function(config) {
>   persist = config[1]
>   trade.method = config[2]
>   solow.config = config[3]
> 
>   # Assuming myFunction is defined in src/lib/utils2.R
>   source("src/lib/utils2.R")
>   # Call your function with trade.method as a parameter
>   myFunction(trade.method, other.arguments)
> })
> ```
> 
> Make sure `myFunction` inside `src/lib/utils2.R` is defined to accept this parameter, such as:
> 
> ```r
> myFunction <- function(trade.method, other.arguments) {
>   # Use trade.method directly in the function
> }
> ```
> 
> By explicitly passing variables as arguments, you ensure they are available within the scope of the functions that need them, even in a parallel computing environment. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance on this!
**user**:
> Why doesn't source("src/lib/utils2.R") happen in each node, and therein see the `trade.method` variable I've set right in the function(config) ...?
**assistant**:
> The reason `source("src/lib/utils2.R")` does not have access to the variable `trade.method` in each node/context is due to how the R parallel processing model works, particularly with `parLapply` and similar functions in the `parallel` package.
> 
> ### Key Points:
> 
> 1. **Isolated Environments**: Each worker (node) created by `parLapply` runs in its own isolated workspace. This means they do not share the global environment or variables from the main R session or other workers. When you source a file, it executes in the context of that worker's environment, which does not include any variables defined in the parent function.
> 
> 2. **Variable Scope**: The `trade.method` variable you define inside the function passed to `parLapply` is not globally available. When you call `source("src/lib/utils2.R")`, the sourced script runs in the worker's environment, which doesn't have visibility of `trade.method`.
> 
> ### Solutions:
> 
> To make variables available to each worker, consider these approaches:
> 
> - **Pass Variables Explicitly**: As mentioned earlier, modify the functions or scripts to accept necessary variables as parameters. This is the most common practice in parallel programming.
> 
> - **Use Global Options**: If you have variables or settings you want shared across all workers, you could set them as global options before starting parallel processing, then access them in the sourced file. However, this is less flexible and can lead to difficulties in managing states.
> 
> Here's an adjusted example:
> 
> ```r
> parLapply(cl, configs, function(config) {
>   persist = config[1]
>   trade.method = config[2]
>   solow.config = config[3]
> 
>   # Source the R script within the worker's environment
>   source("src/lib/utils2.R")
> 
>   # Ensure that functions in the sourced script can receive trade.method
>   result = myFunction(trade.method, ...)
>   return(result)
> })
> ```
> 
> ### Revisiting Your Source Code:
> 
> Inside `src/lib/utils2.R`, ensure that you have a function designed to accept `trade.method` as an argument. For example:
> 
> ```r
> myFunction <- function(trade.method, ...) {
>   # Your logic here using trade.method
> }
> ```
> 
> ### Summary:
> 
> R's parallel processing creates isolated environments to avoid unintended side effects and to maximize resource use, which is why variables need to be passed explicitly. Understanding this scoping behavior is key to effectively using parallel processing in R. If you need further assistance, just let me know!
**user**:
> I don't get it. Isn't `trade.method = config[2]` me setting trade.method in the worker environment?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you're correct that `trade.method = config[2]` is indeed setting the variable `trade.method` within the local environment of the worker. The confusion arises from where and how the variable is accessible following that assignment.
> 
> ### Key Concepts Clarified:
> 
> 1. **Local Environment of Workers**:
>    - When you run `parLapply`, each worker (or node) has its own local environment. The line `trade.method = config[2]` indeed creates a variable `trade.method` in the worker's local environment.
> 
> 2. **Sourcing Files**:
>    - When you call `source("src/lib/utils2.R")` within that worker environment, the code in `utils2.R` runs in the context of the worker's local environment **at that moment**. However, variables in the local environment set up after the `source` call are not available to the functions or code executed within the sourced file unless they are explicitly passed as arguments.
> 
> 
> ### Why `trade.method` Isn't Found:
> 
> When you source `src/lib/utils2.R`, any code within that file that tries to access `trade.method` will fail with "object 'trade.method' not found" if it's run **before** `trade.method` has been defined. Since sourcing typically runs the entire script, the function in that file does not see `trade.method` because it's scoped only to the local environment created by your `parLapply` function.
> 
> ### Proposed Solution:
> 
> To resolve this misunderstanding, you should do one of the following:
> 
> 1. **Ensure the functions within `utils2.R` take `trade.method` as an argument**. This is the best practice for modular code.
> 
>    Example:
> 
>    ```r
>    # In your main parallel function
>    parLapply(cl, configs, function(config) {
>      persist = config[1]
>      trade.method = config[2]
>      solow.config = config[3]
> 
>      source("src/lib/utils2.R")
>      result = myFunction(trade.method, ...)  # Pass trade.method to myFunction
>      return(result)
>    })
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Structure `utils2.R` to properly use defined variables**. Refactor as needed:
> 
>    ```r
>    # In `src/lib/utils2.R`
>    myFunction <- function(trade.method, ...) {
>      # Use trade.method here
>    }
>    ```
> 
> ### Summary:
> 
> In R’s parallel computing, variables defined in one context (like your `parLapply` function) need to be passed to other contexts (like sourced functions) explicitly. This is to maintain clean and clear variable scopes and to help avoid unexpected behaviors.
> 
> If you need more clarification or help implementing this, feel free to ask!
**user**:
> But I source src/lib/utils2.R after I set trade.method.
**assistant**:
> I see where the confusion lies, and I appreciate your patience! Let's clarify how the scoping and sourcing interact in your code:
> 
> ### Understanding the Scoping Issue
> 
> When you call `source("src/lib/utils2.R")` after you've defined `trade.method` in the worker's environment, you are indeed correct that `trade.method` is set ***before*** sourcing. However, the sourcing behavior and variable access in the subsequent code can still lead to issues.
> 
> Here's what happens step-by-step:
> 
> 1. **Variable Assignment**: You set `trade.method = config[2]` in the worker environment. Now, within that worker, `trade.method` exists.
> 
> 2. **Sourcing the Script**: When you execute `source("src/lib/utils2.R")`, the file is sourced, meaning all the top-level code in that R script is executed in the worker's environment **at that time**. However, if the sourced script has functions that reference `trade.method`, and those functions are defined *before* the assignment, then they won't see this variable because they capture the environment at the time of their definition.
> 
> 3. **Function Definitions**: If `src/lib/utils2.R` has function definitions that rely on `trade.method` directly, those function definitions won't have access to it, because they won't dynamically look for `trade.method` in the calling context when executed—they look for it in their own (which is not defined at the time of their creation).
> 
> ### How to Fix the Issue
> 
> To ensure that `trade.method` is available in the functions you are sourcing, you can do one of the following:
> 
> 1. **Pass `trade.method` as an Argument**: Structure your functions to accept `trade.method` as a parameter, so they can use it directly when called. This is the cleanest approach.
> 
>    Example:
> 
>    ```r
>    # In your main function
>    parLapply(cl, configs, function(config) {
>      persist = config[1]
>      trade.method = config[2]
>      solow.config = config[3]
> 
>      source("src/lib/utils2.R")  # Source the script
>      # Call your function from the script
>      result = myFunction(trade.method, ...)  # Pass trade.method as an argument
>      return(result)
>    })
>    ```
> 
>    And in `utils2.R`:
> 
>    ```r
>    # Define your function
>    myFunction <- function(trade.method, ...) {
>        # Use trade.method here
>    }
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Modify the Sourced Script**: If for some reason you want to access `trade.method` directly within the sourced file, make sure that you're calling that variable after you've sourced the script, and that it’s defined **within functions or reactive evaluations** that will ensure it's available at runtime.
> 
> ### Summary
> 
> While you do define `trade.method` in the worker's environment before sourcing the script, if the functions in the sourced script were defined without awareness of `trade.method`, they won't automatically gain access to it. Pass the variable explicitly as an argument to avoid scope issues, which is also a good practice for keeping functions reusable and modular.
> 
> If you have more questions or need additional explanations, feel free to ask!
**user**:
> Okay, I think the problem is something else. I think that `source("src/lib/utils2.R")` only has access to things in the global environment, so it's a question of global vs. local, not timing. When I replace `trade.method = config[2]` with `trade.method <<- config[2]`, it runs. I'm hoping that each worker is getting its own global environment, so that they don't clobber each others global variables. Is this diagnosis correct and solution workable?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you're absolutely correct! Your diagnosis regarding the issue is spot on. Let’s break it down:
> 
> ### Global vs. Local Environment
> 
> 1. **Local Variables**: In your parallel worker, when you do `trade.method = config[2]`, you are creating a local variable that resides in the worker's own environment. This is not accessible outside of that local context, including when sourcing other scripts.
> 
> 2. **Global Variables**: When you use the global assignment operator `<<-`, you are assigning `trade.method` to the worker's global environment. Each worker has its own separate global environment, so using `<<-` ensures that the `trade.method` you set will be accessible to anything sourced afterwards in that same worker's global scope.
> 
> ### Solution Viability
> 
> Using the `<<-` operator effectively allows you to set the variable in the worker's global environment and ensures that any functions you subsequently source from `src/lib/utils2.R` can access it. Just keep in mind the following:
> 
> - **Avoid Clobbering**: Since each worker has its own global environment, you won't be clobbering the variables in other workers' global environments, which helps avoid conflicts.
>   
> - **Side Effects**: Be cautious with using global assignments, as they can lead to less predictable code and harder debugging if you start relying on variables being set globally. Ideally, you structure your functions to be self-contained and use parameters to maintain clarity.
> 
> ### Example of Corrected Code
> 
> Here’s how you can structure your code using the global assignment:
> 
> ```r
> parLapply(cl, configs, function(config) {
>   persist = config[1]
>   trade.method <<- config[2]  # Using global assignment
>   solow.config = config[3]
> 
>   source("src/lib/utils2.R")  # Source the script
>   result = myFunction(...)  # Call your function defined in the sourced script
>   return(result)
> })
> ```
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> Your understanding of how the `<<-` operator works and its implications in the context of parallel processes is correct. It's a valid workaround, but just remember to use it judiciously to maintain clean and understandable code. If you have more questions or need more examples, feel free to ask!
