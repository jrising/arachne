> What was the earliest carbon emissions trading system implemented in the US?
**assistant**:
> The earliest carbon emissions trading system implemented in the United States was the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), established in 2009. 
> 
> RGGI is a cooperative effort among the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont to cap and reduce CO2 emissions from the power sector. 
> 
> It is significant because it was the first mandatory market-based program in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. RGGI is a cap-and-trade system, setting an overall limit on emissions from electricity power plants, and permitting trading of the allowances so that the market can find the most cost-effective ways of making cuts.
