> Twelve energy sector indicators were assessed to provide a granular examination of global progress towards decarbonization of the energy sector, as well as an assessment of future energy consumption.
> 
> For each of the 12 indicators, historical time series data were used to compare development trends against International Energy Agency scenarios, under the World Energy Outlook 2017. These trends were then aggregated to forecast emissions from the energy sector and industrial processes to 2040.
> 
> The extrapolated emissions trajectory was compared to emissions under IEA scenarios and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathways RCP8.5, 4.5, and 2.6, generated as part of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and converted into probabilistic temperature rises.
> 
> To summarize the related figures: Figure 1a illustrates energy sector and industrial process CO2 emissions to 2040, based on indicator trends. It shows emissions under different scenarios: RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6. Figure 1b presents the warming probability in different scenarios for the year 2100.

> This emissions trajectory and risk assessment indicates that emissions are likely to continue to rise slowly until the late 2020s and subsequently decline very gradually to around 35 gigatonnes in 2040, approximately six percent higher than in 2019. Emissions are expected to reach just under 25 gigatonnes of CO2 in 2100, about a third lower than in 2019. The trajectory most closely tracks RCP4.5 and is significantly below RCP8.5 but is also much higher than safer emissions pathways.
