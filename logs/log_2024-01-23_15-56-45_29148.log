**user**:
> What is the "disease" associated with not getting enough calories?
**assistant**:
> The disease associated with not getting enough calories is known as "malnutrition," more specifically "undernutrition." This condition results from a lack of appropriate nutrients in one's diet, which includes both quantity (calories) and quality (variety of nutrients).
> 
> Undernutrition can lead to a variety of health problems. In severe cases, it may result in a condition known as "marasmus," characterized by a severe deficiency in both energy and protein leading to extreme weight loss and weakness. Lack of sufficient calories can also lead to "kwashiorkor", another type of malnutrition, which is a severe protein deficiency, often resulting in swollen bellies due to fluid retention.
> 
> Children suffering from these diseases may present stunted growth, poor cognitive development and weakened immune responses. In the most severe cases, they can be life-threatening.
