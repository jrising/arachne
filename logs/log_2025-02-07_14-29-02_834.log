> For more than 25 years, IMT has worked hand-in-hand with policymakers to create and deploy building-focused legislation and codes that create momentum for greater building efficiency and performance. We specialize in policy approaches that 1) raise performance expectations while providing flexible paths forward, 2) reflect the needs of all community stakeholders, 3) support inclusive economic opportunity, and 4) increase resiliency and health.

IMT unites real estate decision makers, community representatives, government leaders, and energy efficiency service providers to create higher-performing, healthier, more resilient properties that support the people inside them and the communities around them.

> To make a proper estimate of the funding requirements, we would need specific data such as annual budget breakdowns and exact predictions of growth-related expenses for the next 4 years. However, I can provide a very general approach to guide your considerations.
> 
> Here is a rough guideline to estimate top funding priorities:
> 
> 1. **Staff Cost**: The biggest expense likely to be staff salaries. The U.S national average for nonprofit salaries is about $50,000 per year. If you have 35 people, and assuming benefits and overhead add an additional 50% to that base cost, that's approximately $2.625 million a year, or about $10.5 million over 4 years. However, salaries in nonprofits can vary widely based on the role and expertise, so track this with your actual payroll expenses.
> 
> 2. **Program Costs**: Each work area you mentioned might make up a 'program' that requires specific funding. To estimate this, consider the cost of resources required, such as travel for the policy work and meeting costs for the business and community engagement. Consider also any "hard" costs like software, tools, or outsourced assistance. Try to estimate these costs on a per program basis for each of the four years. Keep in mind the cost of expansion, and factor in growth if program activities will ramp up. 
> 
> 3. **Overhead**: Overhead costs might include admin, IT, HR, office space, and utilities. Nonprofits can expect to spend approx 10% - 40% of their budget on overhead. 
> 
> 4. **Development and Communications**: Consider the costs involved in the development activities like fundraising campaigns, donor recognition events, and communications activities. This might be around 10% - 15% of the total budget.
> 
> 5. **Contingency**: It's wise to include a contingency fund, typically around 10% of your budget, to handle unexpected costs or opportunities.
> 
> Add these all up and you have a rough estimate of the total funding required for four years. Once you have a firm figure to aim for, you can divide it amongst potential funding sources in line with their past funding history and the likelihood of support.
> 
> It's important to consider that this is a pretty rough guide, and the real values will depend heavily on your organization's specific circumstances and plans for the next four years. I recommend consulting with financial specialists or fundraisers in your organization to develop a detailed and accurate budget.
> 
> Remember, when you approach the Energy Foundation (or any other potential funder), be sure to clearly communicate the impact their funds will make and align that with their mission and priorities. Show them how their support will not only help you continue the essential work you're already doing, but also allow you to grow and increase your impact. Good luck!

> Our Building Performance Partnership is a national network of local organizations working to make building performance policies a reality for their communities. Members of the network are staffed high-performance building Hubs that deliver customizable best-practice and educational resources to support real estate culture shifts toward better buildings, building performance policy compliance, and workforce development initiatives. IMT manages the Building Innovation Hub in Washington DC. In partnership with local government and community groups, that team created the free Capital Region Green Buildings Career Map that showcases high-performance building sector jobs and the paths job seekers can take to secure them. We are also a proud partner of the Justice Climate Fund, a diverse coalition of community lenders and an awardee of the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Together with the Building Performance Partnership Hubs and industry partners through the Relay Network, we will be providing market development and training support to ensure funding opportunities flow to the buildings in our communities who need it most.
