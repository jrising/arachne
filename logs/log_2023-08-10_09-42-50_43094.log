> I will buy some tires from Costco and have them install them. They also want to know if I want to have a tire balance. Do I?
**assistant**:
> Yes, James, I would recommend getting the tires balanced. Tire balancing ensures that the weight of the tire is evenly distributed around your vehicle's axle. It promotes smooth and safe driving, reduces tire vibrations, improves the tire lifespan, and prevents uneven wear on your car's suspension.

> Whenever new tires are installed or even when older tires are remounted (for example, when the seasons change), it's good practice to have them balanced. Plus, if you don't do it now at Costco where it's convenient, any balance-related problems might require a separate trip to a tire service shop later.
