> For all data, please let me know the parameters of your request, including what years, what format (raster, point data, Excel spreadsheet, etc.), and any particular fields you want (landings and revenue by species, port, state, etc.).  The more specific you can be, the easier and quicker the data can be made available.  For example, we have footprint data from 2008-2021.  Vessel monitoring system (VMS) data go back to 1996 for some fisheries, but really 2006+ for most.  I presume you want the footprint data

When you mention "augmented with vessel monitoring," do you mean provide that layer in addition to the footprint data?  I presume so, but wanted to check.  Please let me know.  As we also discussed, either VMS positional data (individual vessel positions) or trip-stitched VMS data (positions linked together for a particular trip) are available.  If you would like that data (vs. the raster data layer (i.e., VMS positions per grid cell), please clarify.  Individual VMS positional data or trip-stitched data are available through our Office of Law Enforcement.  That would be a separate request that could take longer due to the greater volume of data for such files.

**assistant**:
> In the context of fisheries, "footprint data" usually refers to spatial information on the distribution and intensity of fishing activities. This can include where fishing vessels are operating (i.e., their "footprint"), including latitude, longitude, time spent in certain areas, and the type of fishing gear used. While I don't have a context-specific definition from their conversation, given that this conversation is focused on data related to fisheries, this is the most likely interpretation.
**user**:
> That makes sense, but how is that different from VMS raster data? Doug talks about these as distinct layers.
**assistant**:
> You're right, Doug mentions both "footprint data" and "VMS raster data" as distinct layers. 
> 
> "Footprint data" typically refers to information about the spatial extent and intensity of fishing activities, such as where fishing vessels have operated within a certain time period. It generally provides a broader overview of fishing effort and may include aggregated data at the level of grid cells or other spatial units.
> 
> On the other hand, "VMS raster data" refers specifically to data obtained from Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS). VMS is a technology used to track the location, movement, and behavior of fishing vessels. It typically relies on satellite-based positioning systems, such as GPS, to collect positional data from fishing vessels at regular intervals. VMS raster data, in this context, refers to the representation of this positional data as a raster layer, where each cell in the raster represents a specific area and contains information about the presence or absence of vessel presence or activity.
> 
> In summary, "footprint data" gives a broader view of fishing activities, while "VMS raster data" is a more detailed representation of the specific locations and movements of fishing vessels.
**user**:
> What would the footprint data look like? A raster? Or something else?
**assistant**:
> The specific format or representation of footprint data can vary depending on the data provider and the specific analysis being conducted. However, in the context of fisheries, the term "footprint data" typically refers to aggregated spatial information that describes the distribution and intensity of fishing activities at a certain level of spatial resolution.
> 
> Footprint data is often presented as a grid or raster, where each cell represents a specific geographic area or unit (e.g., a square kilometer or a degree of latitude and longitude). The value of each cell in the raster represents the fishing effort, such as the number of hours or days of fishing activity, the amount of catch landed, or other relevant measures.
> 
> By examining the raster data, it is possible to identify areas with higher or lower fishing intensity, patterns of fishing behavior over time, or areas of overlap between different fisheries or fishing fleets. This information can be helpful for understanding the spatial dynamics of fishing and its potential impacts on fish stocks, habitats, and ecosystems.
> 
> It's worth noting that the specific details and format of footprint data can vary depending on the data collection methodology, the analysis objectives, and the specific parameters requested by the data requester.
**user**:
> Would footprint data be specific to a particular species? To a particular port?
**assistant**:
> Footprint data can be analyzed at different levels of specificity, including by species and by port. The level of detail in the footprint data will depend on the available data sources and the specific parameters requested. 
> 
> For example, when analyzing footprint data by species, it would involve examining the spatial distribution and intensity of fishing activities for a particular fish species or group of species. This could provide insights into where and how much fishing effort is dedicated to targeting specific species.
> 
> Similarly, when analyzing footprint data by port, it would focus on the spatial distribution and intensity of fishing activities in relation to specific ports or harbors. This could help in understanding the fishing pressure associated with different ports and the potential economic and ecological impacts in those areas.
> 
> It's worth noting that the availability and level of detail in the footprint data may vary depending on the specific datasets and fisheries management practices in place. The more specific the analysis parameters requested, the more specific the footprint data can be in terms of species or port information.
**user**:
> What kinds of vessel-level information is available, when using VMS data? Do we know what kind of fishing equipment is used? The tonnage capacity of the ship?
**assistant**:
> Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data provides valuable information about the location and movement of fishing vessels, but it may not include vessel-level details such as the specific fishing equipment used or the tonnage capacity of the ship. VMS primarily focuses on monitoring and enforcing vessel compliance with fishing regulations, ensuring that vessels do not engage in illegal, unreported, or unregulated (IUU) fishing activities.
> 
> The standard information captured by VMS typically includes the vessel's identification number, position (latitude and longitude), date and time stamps, and occasionally the vessel's speed and heading. This information allows authorities to track the movements of fishing vessels and verify whether they are operating within authorized fishing grounds or restricted areas.
> 
> While VMS data can provide insights into the broader patterns of fishing behavior and vessel activity, it may not directly capture vessel-level attributes such as fishing gear type or tonnage capacity. These types of vessel-specific details are typically gathered through other sources, such as fisheries observers, logbook reports, or specific vessel registration and management systems.
> 
> It's important to note that the availability and level of vessel-level information can vary depending on the specific regulatory requirements, data collection programs, and the specific data-sharing agreements in place between authorities and fishing vessel operators.
