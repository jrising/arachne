> I believe I have a pandas dataframe with two indexes, a region index called poly_idx and a date index called time. The format of the date index is like '1980-03-05'. How can I sum these values by year?
**assistant**:
> You can indeed sum your dataframe by year. Below is a way to do it. Let's assume your dataframe is named `df`.
> 
> First, you need to convert the `time` index to a datetime object (if it's not already). You can do this by using the `pandas.to_datetime()` function:
> 
> ```python
> df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time'])
> ```
> 
> Then, you should set those columns as the index if they aren't already:
> 
> ```python
> df.set_index(['poly_idx', 'time'], inplace=True)
> ```
> 
> After that, you can use the `.resample()` method with 'Y' parameter (stands for 'year end frequency'), and then sum over the results. But because your dataframe has a MultiIndex, you need to use the `pd.Grouper()` function at the level of 'time':
> 
> ```python
> df_yearly = df.groupby(['poly_idx', pd.Grouper(level='time', freq='Y')]).sum()
> ```
> 
> As a result, `df_yearly` will be another dataframe, with the same double indexing, but this time, the dates will represent the end of each year ('YYYY-12-31'). If you want the year only, you can remove the month and day from the date:
> 
> ```python
> df_yearly.index = df_yearly.index.set_levels(df_yearly.index.levels[1].year, level=1)
> ```
> 
> `df_yearly` will contain the sums for each region for each year. Just remember that this will sum all of the columns. If you want to sum up only certain columns, you'll need to specify those first.
**user**:
> How would I do the same thing if I have a dataset-- again with dimensions poly_idx and time? time is a "datetime64[ns]".
**assistant**:
> If your `time` column is already in the `datetime64[ns]` format, you can skip the step of converting it to a datetime object. 
> 
> Assuming your dataset is named `df`, you can proceed with the following steps:
> 
> First, set the columns as the index:
> 
> ```python
> df.set_index(['poly_idx', 'time'], inplace=True)
> ```
> 
> Next, you can use the `.resample()` method with the 'Y' parameter to resample the data by year:
> 
> ```python
> df_yearly = df.resample('Y').sum()
> ```
> 
> This will give you a new dataframe, `df_yearly`, where the index represents the end of each year. 
> 
> If you prefer to have just the year as the index, you can extract the year from the datetime index using the `.dt` accessor and the `.year` attribute:
> 
> ```python
> df_yearly.index = df_yearly.index.year
> ```
> 
> Now `df_yearly` will contain the sums for each `poly_idx` for each year.
> 
> It's worth mentioning that this method will sum all of the columns in your dataset. If you only want to sum specific columns, you'll need to select those columns first before applying the resampling and summing steps.
**user**:
> Why does one use resample here and not groupby?
**assistant**:
> The `resample()` method in pandas is designed specifically for time series data, allowing you to perform resampling operations on time-based data. It is a convenient way to aggregate or change the frequency of your data.
> 
> On the other hand, the `groupby()` method is more general and can be used to group the data based on any column(s) in your dataframe. It is commonly used for splitting the data into groups and applying aggregating functions to each group.
> 
> In the case of resampling time-series data, using `resample()` is generally more appropriate and efficient because it has built-in functionality for handling the temporal nature of the data. It provides high-level functionality for resampling at different frequencies (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly) as well as handling missing data during the resampling process.
> 
> The `groupby()` method can also be used to perform similar operations, but often requires more manual work to specify the appropriate time-related operations. It may require creating auxiliary time-related columns or applying functions like `.dt.year` to extract specific components for grouping.
> 
> In summary, `resample()` is typically used for time-based data to resample at different frequencies, while `groupby()` is more versatile and can be used for general grouping and aggregation operations on any column(s) in the dataframe.
