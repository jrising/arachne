> In Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, there's a chapter on persecution of early Christians. He makes the point that Roman philosophers-- and he says, anyone of liberal education, saw their views as a return to a kind of superstition that the Romans considered themselves to have grown out of. Can you explain how they could think that, while still worshiping their own polytheistic deities? I'm interested in the most enlightened understanding of the situation, assuming that Roman philosophers really did think deeply about this subject.

> Edward Gibbon's insights in *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* reflect a complex cultural and intellectual landscape. Roman philosophers, as well as the educated elite, often had a nuanced perspective on religion, which can seem paradoxical by modern standards. Here's an enlightened interpretation of how they might reconcile these views:
> 
> 1. **Philosophical Pluralism**: Roman intellectuals were heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, which included traditions of skepticism, empiricism, and metaphysical exploration. Philosophers like Cicero and Seneca engaged with these ideas, often seeing traditional Roman religious practices as allegorical or symbolic rather than literal truths. This allowed them to participate in religious rites while maintaining a philosophical skepticism about the gods' literal existence.
> 
> 2. **Pragmatic Approach to Religion**: Romans viewed religion as integral to societal cohesion and civic duty. The rituals and deities were seen as vital for maintaining public order and political stability, rather than as a source of personal spiritual truth. From this perspective, Christianity's emphasis on a personal, all-powerful deity and its rejection of state gods could be seen as undermining social and political structures.
> 
> 3. **Distinction Between Philosophy and Superstition**: Roman elites often distinguished between philosophy, as a rational and enlightened pursuit, and superstition, as a primitive or excessive form of religious belief. Christianity, with its miracles, martyrdoms, and emphasis on resurrection, might have seemed superstitious compared to the philosophical, often mythologically interpreted, traditions they practiced.
> 
> 4. **Cultural and Religious Conservatism**: The Roman Empire valued its historical customs and traditions and was generally resistant to change. Novel beliefs, like Christianity, were often met with suspicion, partly because they disrupted the status quo. By framing Christianity as a reversion to superstition, Romans could justify resisting this new and rapidly spreading faith as a threat to their cultural heritage.
> 
> 5. **Intellectual Elitism**: Educated Romans may have viewed Christianity as appealing more to the uneducated and lower classes, further reinforcing their perspective of it as a form of superstition rather than a sophisticated belief system worthy of the philosophical discourse.
> 
> In summary, Roman philosophers could see Christianity as a return to superstition while worshipping their own deities because their engagement with their polytheistic religion was multifaceted, serving social and civic functions. They often saw the traditional pantheon as symbolic and were more concerned with maintaining societal order than with personal spiritual revelations.
