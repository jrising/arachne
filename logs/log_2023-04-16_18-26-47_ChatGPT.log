> I am designing a new language, consisting only of the letters N, I, and O. The meaning of words should be guessable from the order of these letters. N denotes existence and identifies nouns when used as a suffix. O denotes change and identifies verbs. I denotes interaction and identifies adjectives and adverbs.
> 
> There are also 9 derived letters.
>  - OO makes B: act
>  - OI makes Q: change
>  - ON makes A: capable
>  - IO makes R: know
>  - II makes U: communicate
>  - IN makes L: opine
>  - NO makes P: make
>  - NI makes J: sense
>  - NN makes M: have
> 
> In compound words, the first letter provides the general concept, and subsequent letters refine it. Words can also be defined recursively this way, by using a dash ([group1]-[group2]) to construct new concepts.
> 
> Given this information, can you propose a word in this language for "research"?
**assistant**:
> Based on your language system, a suitable word for "research" could be "RON" or "RO-N":
> 
> - R (IO): know
> - O: change (denotes verbs)
> - N: existence (identifies nouns)
> 
> "RON" or "RO-N" would then represent the concept of gaining knowledge through a process of change or investigation, which is in line with the meaning of "research."
