> Dear Professor James Rising,
> 
> I am Prince Yidana Apalazoeya, a graduate from the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR), Ghana, with a distinction honors bachelor’s degree in Natural Resources Management.
> I am reaching out to you because, I am very interested in your research projects specifically on climate change and renewable energy as proposed solutions to environmental problems, climate change inaction, and the social and environmental impacts of technology because it closely aligns with my previous research experiences which I would love to explore further through a Master’s degree in Environmental Science and Management at University of Delaware (UD).
> My interest in environmental science research was sparked during a field trip to the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. During this visit, I used a Geographic Information System (GIS) at the time to identify environmental problems such as water pollution, deforestation, and environmental deterioration through spatial data. I discovered how insufficient conservative approaches, excessive exploitation, and underutilization could impact humanity’s future on planet earth. 
> Due to this experience, I conducted my undergraduate thesis, Farmers' Perception of Climate Change in the Ayakomaso-Sunyani West District of Ghana, to learn how farmers cope with a changing climate. Through this research, I discovered how very little farmers in rural Ghana knew about climate change and the bazaar notions they had on the topic such as, climate change being God’s way of punishing humankind and that rainfall was the only source of water for crop production, thus hampering their search and adoption of more efficient solutions to tackle these challenges. I am curious to apply the findings of this study to explore more practical solutions such as education,green energy, water conservation, ecological biodiversity and forest conservation and restoration to curb some of these misconceptions. 
> 
> Your paper published in Nature Communications on “Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits” fascinated me since it used data-driven results to project the future impact of climate change on mortality rates and the costs and benefits of adaptation measures that populations are likely to undertake. I think the direct and indirect costs of mortality are distributed unevenly around the world, and extreme heat is measurably deadlier for the poorest populations of the world.  To reduce the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the benefits derived from tropics, Effective climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions require stakeholder commitment and involvement, as well as appropriate supporting policies. I enthusiastic and would love the chance to work under your supervision during my Master’s program and contribute to the development of new knowledge in this area.  
>  
> Would you be available to discuss your current research projects and the application process over Zoom sometime in the next couple of weeks? I am available on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, except from 4:00 pm. to 5:00 pm EST. Nevertheless, I am flexible about meeting outside of these times if that is more convenient for you. Please let me know when you will be available to meet.
> It will be a pleasure working with you at University of Delaware (UD). Please find attached my CV and transcript. Thanks for your anticipated response.

> 
> Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in my research projects in the field of climate change and renewable energy. Your background and research experiences align closely with the Master's program in Environmental Science and Management at the University of Delaware (UD).
> 
> Your undergraduate thesis on farmers' perception of climate change in the Ayakomaso-Sunyani West District of Ghana is intriguing, and it is commendable that you wish to explore practical solutions such as education, green energy, water conservation, ecological biodiversity, and forest conservation and restoration. It is essential to address misconceptions and empower communities to adopt more efficient strategies to tackle the challenges posed by climate change.
> 
> I appreciate your interest in my paper published in Nature Communications on "Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits." The uneven distribution of the direct and indirect costs of mortality due to climate change is indeed a significant concern, particularly for the poorest populations. Effective climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions require both stakeholder commitment and appropriate supporting policies. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to work with you and contribute to the development of new knowledge in this area during your Master's program.
