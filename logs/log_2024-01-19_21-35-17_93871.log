> Dear Prof. Rising,

> It is my pleasure to write to you. My name is Xiaodi Zhang and I am Associate Professor and Associate Researcher in Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. I am writing to explore the possible chance of becoming a visiting scholar in the field of Environmental Economics, Resource Economics, Carbon Footprint, carbon emission trading market and carbon tax, etc under your supervision at your famous institution. I am also prepared to participate your ongoing projects. My one year's visit would be fully funded by China Scholarship Council and my proposed length of staying would be one year, probably from December, 2024 to December, 2025.  
> 
> I have been Postdoctoral Fellow at School of Economics, Fudan University. And I obtained my PHD degree in Macroeconomics from Renmin University of China in 2011. I also received my master and bachelor degree from the same university.
> 
> I have hosted some national projects like National Natural Science Foundation of China (General Program): Research on the International Allocation Mechanism of FDI Carbon Footprint Tracking and Related Emission Reduction Responsibilities of Multinational Companies from the Perspective of Global Value Chain, National Social Science Foundation of China (Youth Program): Research on the DSGE Model of Compatibility between Carbon Tax Collection and Energy Technology Innovation under the Theory of Endogenous Technological Change, National Natural Science Foundation of China (Youth Program): Exploration of the Relationship between Carbon Emission Level and Total Cost of Elements in China.
> 
> During the past years, I have published some papers including Correctly Understand and Grasp the Systematic Planning and Overall Deployment of Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in China——Interpretation of Spirit and Mentality Related to Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality of the Party Central Committee in the New Development Stage, Optimization of Public Fiscal Policy under Multi-Objective System of Economy and Environment: Multi-Objective System Decision Model Based on the CGE Framework, Analysis of Welfare and Impact on Employment of Differentiated Carbon Tax: Simulation under the Intertemporal CGE Framework, Research on Carbon Tax Collection and Developing Renewable Energy: Analysis of Growth and Welfare Effects Based on the OLG-CGE Model, Measurement of Impact of Carbon Tax Collection on Prices, Welfare, and Equity in China, Research on Industrial Structure Optimization under Constraints of Growth, Employment, and Emission Reduction Goals.

> Subject: Re: Visiting Scholar Inquiry
> 
> Dear Associate Professor Xiaodi Zhang,
> 
> Thank you for expressing interest in visiting our institution and for reaching out to me. I appreciate the time you have taken to share details of your extensive experience and impressive work in the field of environmental economics and related areas.
> 
> Your research projects in carbon footprints, carbon emission trading, and carbon tax, are indeed significant components within the broad sphere of environmental economics. Likewise, your focus on policies regarding carbon neutrality and renewable energy rightly address pressing environmental issues. 
> 
> However, after considering your research interests and reviewing my current projects, I regret to inform you that our areas of focus do not overlap to a significant degree. My work leans more towards dynamic ecological macro-economics and global damage evaluations, falling a bit outside the scope of research domain you are presently exploring. 
> 
> Given your rich background in mitigation policy research, I believe that you would find working with a research institution or academic whose primary focus aligns more closely with yours to be more beneficial to your goals. 
> 
> Should you wish to discuss more broadly about environmental economics or want to inquire about other potential avenues at our institution, I would encourage you to book a time that suits you for a Zoom call at https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0. 
> 
> I hope you find this information helpful and that you succeed in finding a suitable mentor for your visiting scholar journey.

> Kind regards,
