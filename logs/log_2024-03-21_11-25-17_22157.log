> I am looking for a carbon footprint calculator that I can use in class. Ideally, it would show the calculations-- like how many tons come from flights and why, but also ideally it wouldn't ask for complicated information (like energy usage). Do you have suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Yes, I have a few suggestions:
> 
> 1. **The Nature Conservancy's Carbon Calculator**: This one is simple and easy to use. It breaks down your carbon emissions by sector (e.g., travel, home, food) and provides tips on how to reduce your footprint. It may not offer calculations as in depth as you like about flights, for example, but it could be a good start.
> 
> 2. **The Clean Air-Cool Planet Calculator**: This calculator is geared towards individuals and small businesses. It's a downloadable Excel file, so you can see the calculations behind the scenes. It is relatively detailed, so might ask for some information you don't have at hand.
> 
> 3. **CoolClimate Network's Carbon Footprint Calculator**: This one, developed by the University of California, Berkeley, provides more detailed breakdowns and allows users to set reduction goals. It might still require more detailed information than you want, but it's quite comprehensive.
> 
> 4. **World Wildlife Fund's Footprint Calculator**: This one is very user-friendly and asks simple lifestyle questions. However, it's not as revealing of the calculations.
> 
> None of these will perfectly meet your criteria of showing calculations without asking for detailed information. One option could be to use one of the simpler calculators in class, and then discuss the behind-the-scenes calculations separately. Or, as a classroom project, you could guide students to create their own simple carbon footprint calculator using basic formulas and assumptions, tailored to the level of complexity you think appropriate.
