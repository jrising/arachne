> What should I use for the TTL in setting up a DNS record in google domains?
**assistant**:
> The Time-To-Live (TTL) value in DNS records tells how long the record should be cached by systems requesting it before they ask for a fresh copy. The ideal TTL value for your DNS record can vary depending on the specific needs of your website and how often you anticipate needing to change your DNS records.
> 
> However, a common practice is to set a TTL of around 1 hour (3600 seconds). This means that if you need to change the DNS record, you would have to wait a maximum of one hour for the change to propagate fully.
> 
> In Google Domains, you can set the TTL via the following steps:
> 
> 1. Sign in to [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar).
> 2. Select the name of your domain.
> 3. Open the menu [â˜°].
> 4. Click "DNS".
> 5. In the "Custom resource records" section, fill in the form to create your record. Here, you can specify the TTL (in seconds).
> 6. Click "Add".
> 
> Remember, lower TTLs can help avoid downtime when changing hosts or servers but might result in slightly more DNS lookup traffic. Higher TTLs reduce the amount of DNS lookup traffic but could result in longer downtimes when changing hosts or servers as the changes take longer to propagate.
