> I got a paper referee comment as follows: 
> "Line 246-7: “We find that low- and middle-income countries have experienced a total loss of $26 trillion [$15 - 247 45 trillion], over half of the total 2023 GDP of the developing world ($44 trillion).” This compares a stock (cumulative losses) to a flow (annual GDP). Perhaps a stock-to-stock or flow-to-flow comparison is more meaningful?"

> I agree with the reviewers sentiment, but I don't know if there's a stock-to-stock comparison that works for $26 trillion.

> This is a thoughtful critique from the reviewer, and addressing it can help strengthen your paper's arguments. When comparing stocks to flows, try to align the timescales or the conceptual frameworks you're using.

> One possible approach is to estimate the present value of the lost income over time, which could then be compared to the present value of future GDP over a similar period. This would transform both figures into a "stock" by considering how the cumulative losses could have been invested and generated returns over the years.

> Alternatively, you could develop an aggregate figure for past GDP, essentially summing GDP over the same period used to estimate the cumulative loss, though that would diverge somewhat from recent GDP figures.

> Another option could be finding a measure of capital stock for these countries, such as the total capital invested in infrastructure or other long-lived assets, and compare the cumulative loss to that figure, although such a measure might not be as readily accessible.

> Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the availability of data and the specifics of your analysis.
