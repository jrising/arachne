> Do I need a host and an invitation letter to visit China as an American coming for tourism?
**assistant**:
> No, as an American tourist traveling to China, you generally do not need a host or an invitation letter. However, the requirements can change and often depend on the type of visa you apply for. As of my last update in 2021, to apply for a tourist (L) visa, you need the following documents:
> 
> 1. A passport valid for at least 6 months from the date of application and with at least one blank visa page.
> 2. A completed visa application form (Form V.2013).
> 3. A recent passport-type photograph.
> 4. Itinerary: Proof of round-trip airline ticket booking and hotel reservation, or a letter of invitation from your host in China. The letter should contain:
>     - Information on the applicant (full name, gender, date of birth, etc.)
>     - Information on the planned visit (arrival and departure dates, place(s) to be visited, etc.)
>     - Information on the inviting host (name, contact details, relationship to the applicant)
> 5. A photocopy of the information/photo page of your passport.
> 
> Before making any travel plans, you should check the latest information from the Chinese embassy or consulate, or a reliable travel agency. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected traveling globally, and restrictions or requirements can change frequently.
> 
> Also, bear in mind that you need to apply for your visa at least a month before your intended travel date to account for any processing times.
