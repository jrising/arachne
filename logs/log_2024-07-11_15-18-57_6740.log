> Abstract
> Estimates of global economic damage from climate change assess the effect of annual temperature changes. However, the roles of precipitation, temperature variability and extreme events are not yet known. Here, by combining projections of climate models with empirical dose–response functions translating shifts in temperature means and variability, rainfall patterns and extreme precipitation into economic damage, we show that at +3 °C global average losses reach 10% of gross domestic product, with worst effects (up to 17%) in poorer, low-latitude countries. Relative to annual temperature damage, the additional impacts of projecting variability and extremes are smaller and dominated by interannual variability, especially at lower latitudes. However, accounting for variability and extremes when estimating the temperature dose–response function raises global economic losses by nearly two percentage points and exacerbates economic tail risks. These results call for region-specific risk assessments and the integration of other climate variables for a better understanding of climate change impacts.

> Main
> Projections of economic damage from climate change are key for evaluating climate mitigation benefits, identifying effects on vulnerable communities and informing discussions around adaptation needs, as well as loss and damage financing. On a global or country level, such assessments have focused on how projected changes in annual mean temperatures affect gross domestic product (GDP)1,2,3,4. However, the widespread losses in recent years driven by flooding and drought suggest that precipitation variability and extremes are similarly important5,6. Anthropogenic forcing is increasing the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes and variability on multiple scales, altering daily temperature patterns and driving an overall increase in precipitation over land7,8. Continued global warming is expected to exacerbate these trends, potentially with uneven impacts across regions5,9,10. Therefore, including precipitation, variability and extremes can improve the precision, comprehensiveness and interpretability of climate change damage estimations11.
> 
> Economic damage from climate change can be assessed either bottom-up by quantifying, valuating and aggregating specific impacts (for example, crop failures or labour supply changes) or top-down by identifying the statistical relationship between observed climatic shifts and economic growth. While both approaches have advantages and limitations, top-down approaches usually neglect climatic shifts beyond annual temperature changes12. To address this shortcoming, recent studies have estimated the relationship between macrolevel income and a wider range of climatic indicators, such as total precipitation13,14,15, temperature variability16,17 or temperature and precipitation extremes and anomalies14,18,19. However, these studies do not investigate how much the inclusion of these climate indicators alters previous economic assessments of climate change, which is highly relevant for policy-making and future adaptation. A notable exception is ref. 15, which projects the effects of annual precipitation and temperature shifts on inequality. A comprehensive assessment of the projected economic impacts of intense periods of precipitation and temperature anomalies, however, is still missing.
> 
> In this study, we draw upon recent advances in estimating dose–response functions, which relate shifts in various climate indicators (total precipitation, temperature variability, precipitation anomalies and extremes) to GDP changes14. Combining these functions with projections from 33 models of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), including two large ensembles, we investigate how including these indicators affects the understanding of future economic impacts at different global warming levels. Variability and extremes introduce substantial climatic and associated economic uncertainties and we conduct a variance decomposition to determine the main uncertainty drivers. Furthermore, we explore how including variability and extremes in empirical regressions alters the dose–response function for annual mean temperature, which the extant literature has estimated controlling only for annual precipitation1,2,4,20,21.
> 
> Projecting GDP impacts for six climate indicators
> Compared to annual temperature, future changes in precipitation and temperature variability under climate change are subject to high uncertainties8,22,23. To capture these uncertainties, we use projections from various CMIP6 models10 to analyse four climate indicators besides annual mean temperature and annual precipitation: (1) day-to-day temperature variability (how much daily temperatures deviate from monthly means); (2) extreme precipitation (the annual sum of precipitation on days with exceptionally high precipitation exceeding the historical 99.9th percentile); (3) monthly precipitation deviation (how much monthly precipitation deviates from historical means throughout the year); and (4) the number of ‘wet days’ with precipitation above 1 mm d−1. These indicators have been linked to forcing from GHGs24,25 as well as to income growth using a global sample14,16. Considering all indicators in one coherent estimation framework is crucial because variability and extremes correlate strongly with annual temperature, total precipitation and each other (Supplementary Fig. 3). Therefore, combining dose–response functions from different estimations risks double-counting impacts. Notably, our coherent estimation framework14 does not model damage from droughts and heat waves. Therefore, we include heat in a complementary analysis, whereas we find no significant statistical link to economic growth for droughts, potentially due to limited spatial and temporal resolution and impact heterogeneity across regions (Supplementary Appendix F).
> 
> We illustrate our approach for the example of extreme precipitation impacts on economic output for New York State at +3°C of global warming (Fig. 1). On the basis of how a given CMIP6 model and scenario project the respective climate indicator (Fig. 1a), we compare the GDP impacts in a given year against the average impacts if the climate were to remain constant at levels of a recent baseline period (Fig. 1b)2,15. For each model and scenario, the baseline period is the 41-year period during which global warming equals the historical warming between 1979 and 2019 (+0.84 °C), which is the climatic baseline used for estimating the dose–response functions used here (Methods)14. We then repeat this procedure for different CMIP6 models and potential damage parameter estimates based on statistical uncertainty and aggregate results to the national level. This yields a distribution of GDP impacts for each country featuring all years in each model and scenario associated with the same global warming level (Fig. 1c). Therefore, the main sources of uncertainty in our GDP impact distribution for a given global warming level and territory are (1) internal variability for the same CMIP6 model because the magnitude of extremes can vary strongly from year to year and, for large ensembles, across model runs, (2) statistical uncertainty in the dose–response functions and (3) projection differences between CMIP6 models.

> We examine the impact on global GDP for all indicators combined, as well as the separate impacts from annual temperature, annual precipitation and the four variability and extremes indicators (Fig. 2a). Global GDP is estimated to be 3.2% lower (lower/upper decile: 1.2–5.4%) at +1.5 °C of global warming, compared to a world with no further climate change beyond recent levels. At +3 °C, global GDP decreases by 10.0% (5.1–14.9%). When disaggregated by climate indicator, global impacts are strongly determined by the annual mean temperature changes, which account for a GDP reduction of 10.0% at +3 °C. This estimate is consistent with recent top-down studies focusing exclusively on damage from annual temperature changes and projecting impacts of 7–14% of GDP per capita loss by the end of the century at global warming levels of more than +4 °C (refs. 4,8,20); with other top-down studies estimating damage even higher2 as a result of their assumption that temperature changes impact growth trajectories persistently12,26,27. For context, a 10% reduction exceeds the GDP loss of the COVID-19 pandemic when global growth plummeted from +2.6% in 2019 to −3.1% in 2020 or the effect of the global financial crisis in 2009 when global output shrunk by −1.3% (ref. 28). Importantly, recent research suggests that damage attributed to annual temperature covers heat wave impacts at least partially18. Indeed, when disentangling the two, we find that almost half of annual temperature damage can be attributed to heat extremes (Supplementary Appendix F).

> By contrast, increases in annual precipitation in many areas have a small positive impact on global GDP (0.2% at +3 °C warming) and the combined impact of the variability and extremes indicators remains centred around zero. While this suggests a lack of signal, disaggregating projections by individual indicators reveals otherwise (Fig. 2b). At +3 °C, extreme precipitation reduces global GDP by 0.2% (0.1–0.4%), with 99% of our impact distribution indicating economic losses as extreme precipitation increases around the globe (Supplementary Fig. 5). Notably, these impacts are much lower than annual temperature damage. This is somewhat expected because extremes have a lower temporal and spatial correlation. Therefore, aggregation from daily, location-specific events to annual indicators and country-level projections reduces signals more strongly compared to annual mean temperature13,14. However, a 0.2% GDP loss due to extreme precipitation globally for an average year still represents a tenth of the damage caused by the catastrophic 2022 floods in Pakistan, estimated at 2.2% of GDP29. Global GDP losses from extreme precipitation are compensated, on average, by temperature variability reductions in higher latitudes (+0.1% of global GDP at +3 °C)24,30 and fewer wet days (+0.2%). However, only 63% and 74% of the impact distribution imply global economic gains for these indicators, respectively. Monthly precipitation deviations, on average, add to global GDP losses (0.2% at +3 °C), but uncertainty ranges remain centred around zero.
> 
> To explore uncertainty drivers, we decompose the variance in GDP impacts from each climate indicator into statistical dose–response function uncertainty, climate model uncertainty and internal variability (Fig. 2c). For annual temperature damage, uncertainty is primarily driven by the dose–response function, particularly at higher global warming levels. By contrast, impact uncertainty for annual precipitation and variability and extremes is dominated by internal variability. Additional analyses focusing on the two large ensembles in our sample suggest that this stems primarily from interannual variation within model runs rather than differences across ensemble members (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). Moreover, disagreement between CMIP6 models plays either a comparable or a more substantial role than dose–response function uncertainty for these additional indicators (except for monthly precipitation deviation) and is particularly pronounced for day-to-day temperature variability and the number of wet days (Fig. 2d). Notably, the share of climate model uncertainty decreases in global warming for annual temperature impacts but not for variability and extremes because even for a stronger global warming signal, GDP impact projections do not converge between models.
> 
> Country-level results
> Because global aggregates risk masking heterogeneities across regions, we further investigate the combined country-level GDP impacts from all six climate indicators at +3 °C of warming (Fig. 3a). All countries face GDP losses, in line with recent evidence that climate change might not benefit cooler countries economically20. Impacts are more severe in the Global South and highest in Africa and the Middle East, where higher initial temperatures make countries particularly vulnerable to additional warming. Considering the combined GDP impact of all four variability and extremes indicators reveals a clear North–South divide (Fig. 3b). While for higher latitudes, the decrease in temperature variability and, for some countries, wet days (Supplementary Fig. 5) mitigates overall GDP damage, variability and extremes exacerbate GDP losses in most parts of the Global South. However, these effects vary substantially across the full distribution of projected impacts for each country.

> Annual temperature is the only indicator where negative impacts arise for at least 90% of our impact distribution for all countries (upper dashed line in Fig. 3c), including substantial impacts in several colder countries partially because the temperature dose-response function deployed here implicitly features damages from higher inter-annual temperature variability as well (Supplementary Appendix C). Annual precipitation increases benefit most countries on average, but for many countries, less than two-thirds of the distribution supports the sign of expected impacts (lower dashed line). For day-to-day temperature variability, we find a clear divide between relatively certain gains for a few high-income countries and less certain, smaller losses for many lower-income countries as a result of variability increases in lower latitudes24. While extreme precipitation increases in most regions, projected damages are highest and least uncertain for middle- and high-income countries in higher latitudes such as China and the United States31. In contrast, low-income countries are more likely to face losses from shifts in precipitation deviation and wet days, but high uncertainties limit the conclusions that can be drawn.
> 
> Overall impact of including variability and extremes
> The results in the previous sections seemingly suggest that including variability and extremes in GDP impact projections exacerbates disparities between higher- and lower-income countries (Fig. 3) but does not substantially alter the implications of climate change for global GDP (Fig. 2), particularly since annual temperature damages capture heat wave impacts to some extent already. However, providing an apples-to-apples comparison with the recent climate economics literature requires calculating damage on the basis of the current ‘status quo’ approach, which (1) projects only damage from annual temperature changes and (2) estimates the relationship between income growth and annual temperature controlling only for annual precipitation1,2,4,20,21. When comparing the resulting global GDP impacts following this status quo methodology to our approach, which (1) projects damage for all six indicators and (2) controls for all our climate indicators when estimating the temperature dose–response function (Fig. 4a), we find that including variability and extremes increases global damage at +3 °C of global warming by 1.8 percentage points (10.0% instead of 8.2%).

> The main reason for this increase is that controlling for variability and extremes, instead of only for annual precipitation, increases the estimated effect of mean temperature changes (Fig. 4b). The marginal GDP impact of a +1 °C rise in annual temperature increases by more than 0.5 percentage points irrespective of the initial temperature level when all climate indicators are included as control variables (red line). Most of this effect is driven by including temperature variability (dotted line), which leads to higher impacts, particularly for colder regions. Therefore, the positive impacts of temperature variability in Fig. 3 obscure that, in fact, including this parameter leads to higher global damage since it disentangles potential benefits of reduced variability from the negative effects of temperature increases. As a result, including all climate indicators exacerbates GDP impacts across the globe (Fig. 4c).
> 
> Exposure to tail risks
> Aside from average impacts and the uncertainty around them, prudent risk management by policy-makers also requires information about tail risks. Therefore, we examine the percentage of the present global population living in countries that have a non-negligible chance (at least 5%) of suffering from damage exceeding different thresholds at different global warming levels (Fig. 5a), both for our main approach (solid line) and the status quo approach (dotted line). Even at +1.5 °C, tail risks are substantial, with 99% of the global population living in countries with a non-negligible risk of suffering GDP damage of 5% or higher if all climate indicators are included. Notably, including variability and extremes increases tail risks considerably (Fig. 5b). While under the status quo, 54% of the global population is projected to face damage of at least 15% with a likelihood of at least 5% at +3 °C of warming, this increases to 68% of the population when variability and extremes are included. The share of the global population facing catastrophic impacts of 20% or higher with a 5% chance rises from 4% to 17%. However, disaggregating these results by individual climate indicators (Supplementary Fig. 6) highlights that the increase in global exposure to catastrophic climate change damage is primarily driven by higher temperature damage if underlying regression models control for more climate indicators than just annual precipitation and less by the direct impacts of these indicators on global GDP.

> Discussion
> Taken together, our results illustrate that projecting top-down damage of variability and extremes exacerbates global disparities further. Aggregate GDP loss projections, however, remain primarily driven by the impacts of mean temperature changes, which seem to cover economic losses due to heat waves at least partially18—an important finding for climate–economy modelling that complementary assessments of economic damage should corroborate to disentangle different impact channels better. As a result, overall uncertainty in GDP losses is dominated by the temperature dose–response function. However, substantial climatic uncertainties still limit the understanding of direct impacts by variability and extremes, particularly for low-income countries, which are expected to suffer the most but exhibit the largest uncertainties.
> 
> For scholars studying the economic effects of climate change, our results suggest a potential downward bias in temperature damage estimates by not disentangling the impacts of changes in temperature means and temperature variability. Future studies estimating temperature dose–response functions should test how including variability and extremes indicators linked to economic growth alters their findings. Notably, such biases could also be caused by other climate indicators not explicitly considered here and their direction and magnitude are likely to vary by location32. Furthermore, since the signal clarity is highest for extreme precipitation, this indicator seems most suitable to be included in climate–economy calculations, such as the social cost of carbon.
> 
> While our results rest on strong empirical foundations and a wide range of state-of-the-art climate models, there are several reasons why actual GDP impacts may exceed our projections. First, while the temperature dose–response function seems to include heat impacts at least partially, the dose–response functions used here do not explicitly cover important climate extremes, most notably droughts33. Second, to be conservative, we abstract from the possibility that climatic shifts do not only change GDP growth in a given year but alter a country’s long-run growth trajectory persistently. While such persistence in GDP losses remains empirically debated1,2,14,21,34, it would increase damage estimates substantially26,27. Third, aggregation across time and space is more likely to reduce signals in precipitation patterns because of their lower spatial and temporal correlation compared to annual mean temperature13,14. For these reasons, our results should be seen as an important first step, but they certainly do not exclude the possibility of larger GDP losses. Furthermore, econometric-based dose–response functions such as the ones used here have several limitations; for example, the risk of conflating weather impacts with climatic shifts or the extrapolation of impacts to warming levels that go far beyond historical observations, with the implicit assumption that adaptation remains at historically observed levels35,36. In addition, specification questions can further exacerbate socioeconomic uncertainties21 and uniform dose–response functions for aggregate GDP can mask heterogeneities between countries, sectors and income segments15. Moreover, considering impacts in percentage of GDP implicitly assigns lower weights to poorer regions within countries that are disproportionately exposed to climate change risks37. Lastly, the distributions presented here might underestimate true climatic uncertainties for at least three reasons: (1) measurement imperfections in the reanalysis data underlying the dose–response functions, particularly for precipitation and lower-income regions32,38; (2) using single runs for most CMIP6 models may underestimate tail risk events (Supplementary Appendix E); and (3) not all CMIP6 models, despite representing the current frontier of global climatic projections, fully capture future changes in temperature variability and precipitation24,25,39,40,41.
> 
> Nevertheless, our study represents a key improvement in top-down damage projections, highlights the risks of omitting climate indicators beyond annual temperature, either as impact channels or control variables, and identifies the most promising fields for additional research. Building on our work, researchers could integrate further climate indicators, such as droughts, into a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts. Aside from improvements in climate modelling, particularly for developing countries, this would also require more empirical studies to robustly identify the link between economic growth and different climatic extremes, ideally combined with an improved temporal or spatial resolution17. In addition, future research should assess the impact of controlling for these extremes on temperature dose–response functions and enhance the understanding of potential adaptation mechanisms and the persistence of GDP losses, ideally by consistently estimating and implementing persistence for each climate indicator under consideration.
