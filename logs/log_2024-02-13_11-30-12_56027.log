**user**:
> Where should van den Belt be alphabetized in a bibliography?
**assistant**:
> The surname "van den Belt" should be alphabetized under "V," treating "van den Belt" as a single unit. This follows the convention in most English-language bibliographies for Dutch and Flemish names, where prefixes like "van," "van den," or "van der" are a part of the last name for sorting purposes.
> 
> However, in a Dutch-language context or according to Dutch tradition, the name may be alphabetized under "B". In some systems, "Belt, van den" may be used. It's always worth checking what local convention or specific style guide dictates, as practices can vary.
