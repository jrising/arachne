> I am reviewing some deliverables for a Horizon 2020 grant. Some of the materials there are great and I would like to share them. Are these materials considered shareable?
**assistant**:
> Horizon 2020 is known for encouraging open access and the dissemination of its research outputs. Generally, deliverables from Horizon 2020 projects are intended to be public unless there are specific confidentiality clauses or intellectual property rights that restrict sharing.
> 
> Before sharing any material, you should:
> 
> 1. **Check the Grant Agreement:** Review any clauses related to dissemination, confidentiality, or intellectual property. The agreement might specify when and how materials can be shared.
> 
> 2. **Peer Agreement:** If you're part of a consortium, ensure that your partners agree with sharing. They might have specific requirements or concerns about certain aspects of the material.
> 
> 3. **Acknowledge and Cite Appropriately:** When sharing, make sure to properly acknowledge the Horizon 2020 program and any partners involved in creating the materials.
> 
> 4. **Consider the Format:** If the materials are in a format that's not easily accessible to others, you might want to convert them to something more user-friendly.
> 
> If everything checks out, sharing these materials could be an excellent way to increase the impact of the project and foster collaboration, which are key goals of Horizon 2020.
