> The equivalent term for a man who presents in a masculine way is often "Masc" or "Butch." These terms are used in LGBTQ+ communities to describe a gender expression that aligns with traditional notions of masculinity. Just as "Femme" is used to describe someone with a feminine gender expression, "Masc" or "Butch" can describe someone whose presentation is strongly masculine. However, context and individual identity play significant roles, and the most appropriate term can vary depending on personal preference and cultural background.
