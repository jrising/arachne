**user**:
> Can Linux's find find files that are older than a given date?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the `find` command in Linux can search for files based on their modification time using the `-mtime` parameter. To find files that are older than a specific date, you can use the `-mtime` option with a negative value.
> 
> Here's an example command structure to find files older than a given date:
> 
> ```shell
> find /path/to/directory -type f -mtime +<number_of_days>
> ```
> 
> - `/path/to/directory` is the directory where you want to start the search.
> - `-type f` specifies that you only want to find regular files, excluding directories.
> - `-mtime +<number_of_days>` indicates that you want to search for files older than `<number_of_days>`.
> 
> For example, if you want to find files older than 30 days in the `/home/user/documents` directory, the command would be:
> 
> ```shell
> find /home/user/documents -type f -mtime +30
> ```
> 
> This will list all regular files in the specified directory that have not been modified in the last 30 days or more.
> 
> You can adjust the value of `<number_of_days>` to suit your needs. Remember that the value refers to the number of 24-hour periods ago, so keep that in mind when specifying the threshold date.
