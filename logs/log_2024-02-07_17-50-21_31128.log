**assistant**:
> The error messages hint at different potential issues for both HTTP and HTTPS.
> 
> For the HTTPS `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR`, this error typically occurs when there's an issue with the SSL/TLS setup on the server. It may be an outdated or incorrectly configured SSL certificate, or a missing or wrong configuration in the Nginx settings.
> 
> Here's how you can proceed:
> 
> 1. **Check your SSL Certificate.** Use a tool like [SSL Labs' SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to test the server's SSL setup. This tool should provide a comprehensive diagnosis of the SSL issues if any.
> 
> 2. **Check Nginx configuration.** Ensure the `server` block in your Nginx configuration (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` by default) that defines the SSL settings is set up correctly, like this:
>     ```nginx
>     server {
>         listen 443 ssl;
>         server_name openmodeling.org;
>     
>         ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/your_cert.crt;
>         ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/your_private_key.key;
>     
>         ## Rest of your configuration..
>     }
>     ```
>    Replace `your_cert.crt` and `your_private_key.key` with your actual certificate and private key file names.
> 
> For the HTTP `ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT` error, it suggests that the connection to your server on port 80 is being blocked or not being redirected properly.
> 
> 1. **Check UFW configuration.** Your provided UFW configuration doesn't show port 80 (which is the HTTP default port) being open. Run `sudo ufw allow 80` to open it, and `sudo ufw reload` to apply the changes.
> 
> 2. **Confirm Nginx is listening on Port 80.** Ensure your config file includes a server block that is listening on port 80. It might look something like this:
>     ```nginx
>     server {
>         listen 80;
>         server_name openmodeling.org;
>     
>         ## Rest of your configuration..
>         ## Possibly include a redirect to https here.
>     }
>     ```
> 
> In both cases, after you make changes, ensure to test the syntax of your Nginx configuration file using `sudo nginx -t` and then restart Nginx with `sudo systemctl restart nginx` to apply the changes.
> 
> Remember the general debugging principle: break the problem down into smaller, testable parts. You can use `curl` or `wget` locally on the server to test Nginx without the networking component, use `telnet` or `nc` to test whether specific ports are open, check system and application logs for any detailed error messages, and so forth.
