**user**:
> Why is beach nourishment done?
**assistant**:
> Beach nourishment, also known as beach replenishment, is a strategy applied to counteract beach erosion, which is primarily driven by changes in sea level, storm surge, and human activities.
> 
> Here are main reasons why beach nourishment is done:
> 
> 1. **Erosion Mitigation**: Beach nourishment involves adding sand and sediment to thinning beaches, both to widen them and increase their elevation.  
> 2. **Coastal Protection**: When beaches are nourished, they can better absorb the energy of incoming waves during storms, enhancing coastal protection and reducing risks for beachfront properties. 
> 3. **Habitat Preservation**: Certain wildlife species rely on beach habitats for survival, and nourishment can help maintain these critical ecosystems. 
> 4. **Tourism**: Beaches serve as huge attractions for tourism, which brings substantial revenue to coastal towns and cities. A "healthy" beach, from a visitor's point of view, is a wide one.  
> 5. **Recreational Opportunities**: In addition to tourism, nourished beaches provide better space for recreational activities.
> 
> It's important to note, however, that beach nourishment is not without controversy. It can be costly, needs to be repeated periodically as the new sand erodes, and may harm marine life during the nourishment process.
