The paper focused on the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth in the next eleven countries.
>  I am also thrilled to mention that our paper on carbon emission disclosure and firm value has recently been accepted at the upcoming entrepreneurship and sustainability conference in Qatar University.
> 
> I would like to discuss with you the opportunity to work under your supervision in the area of " Climate change adaptation, Climate change mitigation, sustainable development, Economic growth, and the complementarity between these concepts; I will be particularly interested in understanding how country-level adaptation strategies are affecting economic growth, most especially the agriculture sector which is one of the most vulnerable sectors. However, I am open to suggestions and modifications to refine my ideas.
> 
> Having completed all my course works, I am finalizing my master's thesis on the impacts of ESG reporting on corporate performance.
