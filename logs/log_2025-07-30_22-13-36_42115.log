> Assessments of the health and economic impacts of climate change and those of pollutants are generally disconnect, despite the close association between greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants. We incorporate both processes into a benefit-cost integrated assessment model, which is improved and extended to better understand the combined effects of warming and pollution across the globe.
> 
> We build upon the PAGE-ICE integrated assessment model, expanding it to cover 183 individual countries and five small country groups. We incorporate several critical improvements to better understand spatially heterogeneous hazards, exposure, vulnerability, and emissions: these include (1) integration with the FaIR simple climate model, (2) a novel mapping of climate uncertainty to country-level warming patterns, (3) an empirical approach to dynamic vulnerability using risk indices, (4) a representation of trade and spill-over effects, and (5) updated abatement cost estimates using NGFS energy model scenarios. We also incorporate into the PAGE-ICE model sector-specific impact channels, including agriculture, labor productivity, and mortality, as well as methane-driven impacts from the Global Methane Assessment.

> At the same time, we draw upon results from the GAINS model to calibrate a model of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, based on emissions, income, and pollution control costs. This model also accounts for transboundary flows of PM2.5 and its precursors. We then draw on output of GAINS and LEAP-IBC to quantify how productivity, mortality, and morbidity are affected by pollution levels. Within the PAGE framework, these impacts are part of a feedback loop that affects income (and then vulnerability), capital investment (and then growth), and emissions (and then future impacts). We evaluate the combined effects of climate change and air pollution and the role of these interactions.
> 
> The findings include large, additive losses to economic productivity from warming and pollution, as well as significant non-market losses to health. The vulnerability feedback plays a role in increasing risks, but the largest interaction effect is the diminished size of economies, reducing both warming and pollution.

> This study focuses on the combined effects of climate change and air pollution, areas often assessed separately. However, they are closely linked because emissions contribute to both issues. The researchers enhanced the PAGE-ICE integrated assessment model to better understand these impacts globally.
> 
> The model now covers 183 countries and five groups of smaller countries. Key improvements include linking with the FaIR climate model to project country-specific warming, using risk indices to assess vulnerability changes, accounting for trade effects, and updating cost projections based on energy models. Additionally, it considers specific impacts on sectors like agriculture, labor, and health, including methane-related effects.
> 
> To address air pollution, the researchers used data from the GAINS model to understand changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, factoring in pollution across borders. They estimated how this affects productivity, mortality, and health, integrating these insights into the PAGE model.
> 
> Their results reveal significant economic and health losses from the combined effects of climate change and pollution. While increased vulnerability exacerbates risks, the most notable interaction is that economies are already smaller due to these effects, which somewhat reduces future warming and pollution.
