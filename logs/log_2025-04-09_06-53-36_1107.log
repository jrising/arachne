> The previous page discusses the accelerating impacts of climate change, highlighting the rise in global average temperatures, which have increased from 1.1°C to 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels over the last decade, with 2024 noted as the hottest year on record. This rise is linked to increased greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, which have surged due to human activities like fossil fuel combustion. The text underscores the severity of physical impacts such as sea level rise and increased frequency of extreme weather events, indicating a trajectory towards a 3°C increase by 2100 without changes in current policies. An associated image shows a forest fire, symbolizing the environmental impact of these changes.

> The page explores the economic impacts of global temperature rise, particularly comparing scenarios of a 3°C increase versus limiting it to below 2°C by 2100. It highlights that allowing a 3°C rise could reduce global economic output by 15% to 34%. In the best-case scenario of keeping temperatures below 2°C, GDP growth would decelerate minimally, resulting in a cumulative GDP loss of up to 4%. It emphasizes the avoidable economic damage by taking climate action, supported by an analysis of how GDP could be significantly reduced under current trends without intervention.

It acknowledges both potential resilience and vulnerabilities in economic models, which may not fully account for tipping points like coral reef loss. A case study of a Southeast Asian country highlights possible GDP losses of 18% to 25% by 2050 due to climate risks, compounded by factors such as reliance on coastal resources and poverty. The page details the projected increases in sea level, heat index, and typhoon frequency, along with economic, social, and environmental damages. It underscores the importance of adaptation plans and resilience projects in mitigating these effects.

> Page 11 describes the severe economic and social impacts of climate change on a coastal city in West Africa. The city faces risks from extreme precipitation causing annual flooding, temperature increases, and a projected 3-meter sea level rise by 2050. Economic damages include potential disruption to over 10% of transport and power networks and damage to 700 kilometers of roads. Over 400 health centers may be disrupted, and 82% of wetlands are at risk. Productivity losses are significant, with 44 productive days lost annually. The text highlights that productivity loss and reduced capital accumulation are major economic damage drivers, noting that U.S. losses from climate change totaled $700 billion from 2000 to 2023, with productivity losses nearly six times higher at $4 trillion.

> Page 21 discusses the importance of early climate action to capture environmental returns, noting that investing about 60% of the required efforts can avoid 95% of future inaction costs post-2050. While pre-2050 investment returns are moderate, they can prevent economic damages equivalent to 3% to 10% of GDP, and may be stronger than estimated. Climate impacts post-2050 will financially affect companies even earlier, as they adjust for future risks. The page emphasizes that while most climate investments occur before 2050, the bulk of economic benefits will be realized after 2050.

> Page 22 outlines five barriers to accelerating climate action, despite the clear economic case for limiting global temperature increases. It highlights that political discussions often overlook economic justifications, with leaders framing climate issues more as social and moral concerns. The speeches at major climate conferences reflect this trend, with few addressing the economic damages of climate change or making an economic case for action. It notes that the costs of inaction are more immediate, while benefits are longer-term, and that the transition may result in uneven challenges across countries' economies.

**assistant**:
> Page 24 discusses the uneven costs and benefits of climate actions globally. Even if countries act together under the Paris Agreement, the distribution of consequences remains unequal. The Global North may resist bearing costs primarily affecting the Global South, while the Global South argues against shouldering responsibility for a crisis they minimally contributed to. The page cites a 2023 report highlighting that G20 countries account for 75% of emissions, contrasting with Africa's 4%. Despite different impacts, there is a shared acknowledgment that climate change affects everyone. Economic data illustrates that larger economies, like the U.S., will see greater absolute losses, although the relative impact on smaller economies, like those in Africa, is more severe.

> The economic damages are not fully explored by economists. The economics of climate change have been laying the groundwork for policy tools such as carbon pricing and cap-and-trade systems. Recent methodological advances make it possible to quantify the socioeconomic damages of climate change in greater detail. Complex integrated assessment models blend climate science, economics, and energy systems to evaluate mitigation and adaptation strategies.

> At the same time, the rise of climate econometrics has transformed the field by utilizing empirical models and historical data to capture real-world connections, such as those between temperature and GDP, and to do counterfactual analysis based on climate scenarios from climate scientists. However, the economic models most likely underestimate economic damages on the aggregate, regional, and local levels.

> As a proof point, as methodologies have steadily improved, estimates for economic damages have been continuously revised upward. For instance, the earlier work of many economists estimated relatively modest GDP losses. More recent work estimated significantly higher potential damages of up to twenty-four percent, while others put damages as high as sixty-one percent of global GDP in twenty-one hundred. While there has been some progress from the OECD and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to take climate tipping points into account, most publications do not model climate tipping points or cascading socioeconomic damages.
