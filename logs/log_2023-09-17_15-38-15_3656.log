> Culture. I was also a recitation instructor for three classes outside

> and collaborative learning.  Following graduation, I taught for two
> years at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, running labs and
> recitations for classes in electrical engineering.  In this newly
> established institution, I not only developed new curriculum material,
> but I was also involved in the broader process of building the school.

> Since joining the University of Delaware faculty, I have developed
> four new courses: (1) Climate Change Economics, which I have developed

> complexities of real data; (3) Coupling of Human to Natural Systems,
> which I completely redesigned to provide an interdisciplinary
> perspective on system dynamics across multiple human-natural contexs;
> and (3) Philosophy of Research, a seminar on the epistemological,
> ethical and societal cornerstones of sound research.
>

**assistant**:
> Your research statement provides a clear overview of your interdisciplinary work in environmental economics and computational modeling, with a focus on climate change impacts and the water-energy-food nexus. To tighten up the statement and better emphasize your contributions to global governance for sustainability, here are some suggestions:
> 
> 1. Refine the introductory paragraph to succinctly capture the essence of your research:
> "I am an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational modeler specializing in climate change impacts and the water-energy-food nexus. Through quantitative techniques from various fields, I aim to improve the management of complex social-environmental systems under global environmental change. I firmly believe that integrating multiple disciplines is essential for sustainable development."
> 
> 2. Consider reorganizing the content under specific thematic headings for clarity. For example:
>    - Interdisciplinarity in Climate Risks: Discuss your efforts to bridge the gaps between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics, showcasing specific projects, publications, and collaborations that have advanced the understanding of economic risks related to climate change.
>    - Complexity and Integrated Modeling: Highlight your research on addressing theoretical issues from complexity science and integrated assessment modeling, focusing on the application of these concepts to better manage the food system and other environmental challenges.
> 
> 3. Strengthen the connection between your research and global governance for sustainability by emphasizing the policy relevance and impact of your work. Highlight how your research findings have informed policy decisions, influenced national models, and contributed to strategic planning for climate adaptation and mitigation.
> 
> 4. Provide specific examples of your teaching experience and philosophy that align with global governance for sustainability. Emphasize student-directed and project-based learning approaches, as well as your initiatives in curriculum development and interdisciplinary education.
> 
> Here's a revised version of the first few paragraphs incorporating some of the suggestions:
> 
> "I am an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational modeler specializing in the water-energy-food nexus and the impacts of climate change. My research is driven by a strong commitment to global sustainability and the urgent need for effective governance in the face of environmental challenges. By integrating multiple disciplines and employing quantitative techniques such as econometrics, Bayesian simulations, machine learning, and spatial optimization, I strive to improve the management of complex social-environmental systems under global environmental change.
