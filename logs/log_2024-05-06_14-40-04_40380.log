> I want to have a kind of sorting exercise, between geoengineering techniques, as a class activity. To do so, I will split up the class into 4 groups, and each will compare 2 methods at a time-- choosing which is preferable. Then we do another set of pair-wise comparisons, and eventually have a sorted list, just like a sorting algorithm. I have 6 total techniques I want to compare. How can I set this up?
**assistant**:
> It sounds like what you're looking to implement is an iterative comparison or sorting method, often in algorithms described as "Bubble Sort". It's an excellent model for your problem.

> Here's an outline of how you might proceed, slightly adjusted to accommodate the group structure:
> 
> 1. **First Round:**
>     - Create 3 groups. Each group gets 2 techniques to compare and must decide on which one of their pair they prefer according to the criteria you provide. 
>     - The pairs could be: 
>         - Group 1: Technique 1 vs Technique 2
>         - Group 2: Technique 3 vs Technique 4
>         - Group 3: Technique 5 vs Technique 6
> 
> 2. **Second Round:**
>     - Now we will have 3 "winning" techniques out of 6 and our groups should look like the following, assuming the winning techniques were 1, 3, 5.
>     - Divide into two groups:
>         - Group 1: Technique 1 vs Technique 3
>         - Group 2: Technique 1 vs Technique 5
>         - Note that Technique 1 is being compared twice. This is to ensure every technique is compared against every other technique.
>         
> 3. **Third Round:**
>     - The groups should look like this:
>         - Group 1: Technique 3 vs Technique 5
>     - This pair has not been compared yet, so they get their own round.
> 
> And voila! You have a sorted list of priority techniques given by the class. 
> 
> Nonetheless, it's crucial to follow up with a class discussion on why they chose each technique over another, their implications, advantages, disadvantages and more. An analysis like this is not only quantitative but also heavily qualitative and it would be great educational outcome if the students could voice their reasoning for their decisions. 
> 
> To make the activity even more dynamic and thorough, consider running this operation again under a different criterion. This way, you can also have an interesting conversation about how changing the criteria can affect the decisions.
