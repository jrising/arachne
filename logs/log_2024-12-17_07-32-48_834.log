> I have a computation system that is designed to run on multiple nodes on University HPCs. The basic approach to the system distributing work is to have processes "claim" output directories. But it seems on a new HPC system that the processes are syncing up, and all claiming the same directories. Is there a better way for different node processes to take on different chunks of the work?

> Indeed, you are encountering a classic problem in distributed computing. Here are some possible solutions:
> 
> 1. **Mutex/locks**: You may implement a locking system when a directory is being claimed. When one process starts working on a directory, it locks the directory. This effectively communicates to other processes that the directory has been claimed. This mutex operation must be atomic, meaning it must be indivisible and un-interruptible.
> 
> 2. **Master-worker**: You could adopt a master-worker model. Here, one process (the master) assigns work to the others (the workers). The master keeps track of all the jobs and their states. When a worker finishes processing a directory, it asks the master for a new one. In this way, there's no possibility of workers accidentally choosing the same directory.
> 
> 3. **Job queue**: Another way could be to use a queue data structure. Your directories to be processed can be put into the queue. Each worker grabs a job from the front of the queue and processes it. This guarantees that no two workers will pick up the same job. Just like with locks, the operation of picking a job and removing it from the queue must be atomic.
> 
> 4. **Hashing**: You could use consistent hashing to assign directories to workers. The consistent hash ensures that workers get jobs evenly distributed and can continue to get the same jobs even if some workers are added or removed.
> 
> 5. **Random sleep**: For a less conventional method, you can add a small random sleep before the process claim a directory. This might break the synchronization observed on the HPC system.
> 
> Remember that the solutions involving ensuring atomic operations may be complex to implement in distributed systems, so they are typically carried out using a distributed coordination service such as [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), [etcd](https://etcd.io/), or a high-level job-orchestration framework such as [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
