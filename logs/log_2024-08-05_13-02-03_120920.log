> **Dear Team,**
> 
> I hope this communication finds you well. I'm writing to provide you an update on our exciting national webinar series "Housing the Future: Creating Resilient, High-performance Multifamily Buildings" as a part of our Building Performance Partnership. This project has applied significant staff resources to highlight the exceptional work of practitioners from Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C.
> 
> As many of you are aware, our goal is to secure $35,000 in sponsorships for this series. This funding would be divided evenly across the different hubs participating in this venture. Currently, however, only the DC and IAG hubs have begun their sponsorship outreach. 
> 
> So far, we have secure sign on of approximately $15,000. While this is an achievement in itself, we find ourselves falling short of our set target.
> 
> The DC and IAG hubs' active involvement in outreach is indeed commendable and sets a great example for other hubs. Yet, to optimise the efforts we've put in and to yield a profitable outcome, we need a concerted effort from all participating hubs in outreach towards securing sponsorships.
> 
> I encourage all team leaders, especially those from New York City, St. Louis, Chicago, and Kansas City, to ramp up their engagement and drive their sponsorship efforts. Given the previous success of the 2023 webinar series, we have a promising potential audience that includes building associations, owners, managers, and service providers.
> 
> Remember, the more exposure we can generate for this series, the more appealing it becomes to potential sponsors. Our tiered sponsorship options present ample choice for organizations to align with this worthwhile endeavor. 
> 
> This is an excellent opportunity to showcase our commitment to the transition to high-performance, healthy buildings and to demonstrate our innovative market solutions for decarbonizing sectors such as affordable housing, co-ops, condos, and market-rate residential properties.
> 
> To reach our goals, we need everyone's active participation. So let's rally together and continue to push ahead with this series.
> 
> Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have further inquiries or need additional guidance, please do not hesitate to reach out.
