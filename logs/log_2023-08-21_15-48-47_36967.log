> If you have two independent normal random variables (RVs), X and Y, with means μx and μy and standard deviations σx and σy respectively, the standard deviation of the difference, Z = X - Y, is given by:

> It's important to note that this formula assumes that X and Y are independent random variables. If they are not, the formula becomes more complex and requires the correlation coefficient between X and Y.
