> Dear Prof. Rising,
> 
> My name is Qian Zhang, a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Geographic Information System at Xiamen University, China. I write this email to inquire whether an open position as a visiting Ph.D. student is available since Sep, 2024. The China Scholarship Council (CSC) encourages Chinese students to do research abroad and will cover all the costs. I believe this is an excellent opportunity for me to join an international leading research team to continue my studies.
> 
> 
> 
> I am aware of your expertise in the field of climate change. After reading several of your papers, I found your research very appealing. Currently, I am studying the impact of coastal urbanization on natural habitats, espectially for the coastal wetlands. Specifically, I am identifying the multi-decadal coastal urbanization using cloud-based remote sensing (have published in Remote Sensing of Environment), classifying the urban land functions using deep learning, and analyzing its impact on biodiversity and blue carbon.
> 
> I am highly interested in coastal resilience assessment and remote sensing, and good at processing and analyzing spatial data using GIS and RS software (e.g. ArcGIS, QGIS, and ENVI) and script programming (Python, R, and Google Earth Engine). I am also familiar with the theory of risk and resilience and plan to study the compound impact of climate change and coastal urbanization on the human-sea coupling system. Your research deeply attracted me, so I’m wondering if it would be possible to join you as a visiting student under your supervision for further research.

> My CV is attached in the attachment. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

> Subject: Response to your Inquiry: Visiting Ph.D. Student Position
> 
> Dear Qian Zhang,
> 
> Thank you for your interest in our research team and for reaching out to explore opportunities to collaborate on the study of climate change and coastal urbanization—a subject of great relevance in today's world. 
> 
> Your skills in Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and your expertise in related programming languages are impressive. These competencies align well with the research we undertake, and your focus on the compound impact of climate change and coastal urbanization on the human-sea coupling system will definitely broaden our perspective.
> 
> I encourage your passion for international research collaborations, and commend your efforts in securing support from the China Scholarship Council (CSC). 
> 
> We are indeed open to welcoming visiting Ph.D. students, given a strong alignment of research interests. To further assess how your goals may align with ours, I would suggest a meeting where we can more comprehensively discuss your research and how it could potentially fit into ongoing projects.
> 
> You can schedule a time via this link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0) that best suits you for a Zoom call.
> 
> Thank you again for reaching out, and I look forward to the possibility of future collaboration.
