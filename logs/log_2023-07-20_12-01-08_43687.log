> I am Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki, a research assistant and MSc student of sustainable development with a concentration in entrepreneurship at the American University in Cairo (AUC). The master's course is an interdisciplinary program jointly organized by the School of Science and Engineering, the School of Business, public policy, and Humanities.

> I recently presented a paper at the international energy economics and energy policy conference held in April this year in Barcelona, Spain, where our paper is currently on the verge of being published. The paper focused on the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth in the next eleven countries.
>  I am also thrilled to mention that our paper on carbon emission disclosure and firm value has recently been accepted at the upcoming entrepreneurship and sustainability conference in Qatar University.
> 
> I would like to discuss with you the opportunity to work under your supervision in the area of " Climate change adaptation, Climate change mitigation, sustainable development, Economic growth, and the complementarity between these concepts; I will be particularly interested in understanding how country-level adaptation strategies are affecting economic growth, most especially the agriculture sector which is one of the most vulnerable sectors. However, I am open to suggestions and modifications to refine my ideas.

For my master's in sustainable development at AUC, I have a final CGPA of 3.80/4.00 in my current studies after completing four academic semesters.
> I visited your profile and found that you are interested in climate change, adaptation, and environmental economics. These areas align perfectly with my research interest as I plan to explore this interesting field.

**assistant**:
> Dear Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for sharing details about your academic background. Your experience in research and your demonstrated performance in environment-related studies are impressive. I commend your energy in presenting and preparing your papers for international conferences.
> 
> Your interest in â€œClimate change adaptation, Climate change mitigation, sustainable development, Economic growth," and the interrelationships between these concepts particularly resonates with the focus of my research. Given your previous work and your clear interest in interdisciplinary quantitative modeling and climate change risks, I believe you would be a strong candidate for the Ph.D. Program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware.
> 
> This program is designed to equip our students with the quantitative and economic tools necessary to conduct in-depth research in environmental economics, a factor which might be beneficial to you given your background and interests.
> 
> However, I must let you know that, while we do our best to secure financial support for all students who need it, funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. For the best chance to gain access to any available funds, I recommend that you apply in plenty of time for Fall admission (by the end of the calendar year).
> 
> I encourage you to refine your research ideas and to explicitly articulate how they would contribute to both the academic field of Environmental Economics and the practical realities of environmental policy and sustainable development. Your motivation to understand the impacts of climate change adaptation strategies on economic sectors, particularly in agriculture, is both timely and critical, and would definitely make a valuable contribution to our program and the broader academic community.
> 
> I look forward to learning more about your research and to potentially welcoming you to the University of Delaware in the future. Thank you for considering us as a part of your academic journey.
