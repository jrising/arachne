> I am writing a proposal for a perspectives piece on climate risks, aimed at both natural scientists and economists. In it, I want to briefly describe the prevailing perspectives in these communities. Here is my current attempt. Can you provide thoughts on edits or other points to include?
> 
> The natural science perspective: There is a high risk of pervasive, long-term disruption of the environment due to continued GHG emissions. Warming beyond 1.5°C will result in significant impacts as well as unforeseen changes in the systems that people rely upon, with potentially dire consequences for vulnerable communities across the globe. As a result, it is crucial that we rapidly decarbonize.
> 
> The economic perspective: It is very likely that the benefits of significant decarbonization outweigh its costs, and a suite of policies should be enacted to reduce further warming. However, poverty reduction is also a priority, and the capacity of humans to adapt suggests that no likely climate impacts will undermine sustained economic growth.

> Your proposal already holds promising insights. I suggest more specificity and nuancing on both perspectives, balancing emphasis on shared stakes and individual discipline concerns. Here are my revisions:
> 
> The natural science perspective: There exists an imminent risk of persistent strife in ecosystems due to continued GHG emissions. The perils are not simply linear, but exponential beyond a 1.5°C warming target. This invites possibility for unforeseen, significant, and systemic disruptions impacting human communities. Risks are notably high for vulnerable communities worldwide. The scientific consensus advocates for an urgent systemic shift, principally, rapid decarbonization.
> 
> The economic perspective: Economists largely agree that benefits of substantial decarbonization outbalance its costs, proposing a diversity of policy solutions to curb global warming. Climbing the sustainability ladder doesn't necessarily compromise poverty alleviation. They highlight the human adaptive capacity and innovation underlining that foreseeable climatic impacts won't hinder sustained economic growth. Economists also stress the need to address potential pitfalls of transitioning to a green economy, such as recessions or inequality.
> 
> You may also emphasize the dialogue between these perspectives. Both parties agree on the necessity of mitigating climate change; they differ on impact and response, suggesting a fruitful interdisciplinary exploration.
