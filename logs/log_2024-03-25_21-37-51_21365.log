> For matrices, does A (B v) = (A B) v?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the equation `A * (B * v) = (A * B) * v` is known as the associativity of matrix multiplication, and it holds true for all matrices A and B and vector v, as long as the dimensions of these matrices and vector allow for these operations.
> 
> Remember, matrix multiplication is not commutative (i.e., `A * B â‰  B * A`), but it is associative (i.e., `(A * B) * C = A * (B * C)`). Please also account for the dimensions: If A is of dimension m x n, B is of dimension n x p, and v is of dimension p x 1, then all three multiplications are possible. If not, mathematical errors will occur.

**assistant**:
> Yes, in the expression `(1 - T) x = V 1`, if 1 represents a vector of 1s (say of length n), then the product `V 1` is simply the scalar multiplication of V by the sum of the elements in the vector 1.

> Since the vector 1 is a vector of 1s, its sum is just the length of the vector (n) itself. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

> Assuming that V is a scalar here, this simplification allows you to directly multiply V by the length of the vector instead of performing a vector-matrix multiplication.
**user**:
> V is a matrix, NxN, while 1 is a vector Nx1.
**assistant**:
> In that case, the expression `(1 - T) x = V 1` involves matrix operations and cannot be simplified further based solely on the information provided. 
> 
> Given that V is an N x N matrix and 1 is an N x 1 vector, the multiplication `V * 1` will result in a vector of length N. The term `(1 - T)` suggests some form of subtraction or transformation involving the matrix T and the vector 1, the specifics of which would need to be clarified to simplify the expression further.

> If you provide more details about the matrix T and the nature of the operation represented by `(1 - T)`, I can help you explore potential simplifications or insights into the expression.
