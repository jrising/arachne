> I am reviewing an economic assessment for New York. The following are comments that I have made on other sections of the assessment:
> ===
> 	Generally, the methodologies are clearly described, with details for each step in the analysis. However, the approaches taken in the analysis have some problems (lack of full uncertainty quantification, missing interannual variability, and the use of SSP5-85 as a baseline scenario), and examples of this are drawn out below.
> 	One significant problem, however, is the introductory materials often give the impression that sophisticated models are actually being applied to the consistent geography and scenario information used in this assessment. I believe that this is not correct: instead, typically results are extracted from tables in published studies; if these are in the form of simple equations or coefficients, they are used, and otherwise emulators are developed. Both of these methods add error beyond the original models (for coefficient models, due to the lack of covariance matrixes for coefficients and inconsistent downscaling methods; and for emulators, due to the compounding of errors).
> Ch. 2, line 458	It is worth noting that SSP5-85 has low credibility in the scientific community, due to the inability of most energy system models to produce plausible scenarios for these emissions.
> Ch. 2, lines 466-474	One of the core strengths of an economic analysis is the ability to sum across disparate impacts. For example, the main (only?) reason to translate mortality risk into a dollar amount using the VSL is to make mortality risk commensurate with other costs or benefits. It is even arguable that the totaling of impacts is the central goal of—perhaps the definition of—an economic analysis. So, a lack of total losses is surprising. In addition, the executive summary mentions total losses (including a caution in interpreting them) on lines 19-22.
> Ch. 2, lines 491 and 502	While the criteria for filtering studies is clear, it is not clear how these criteria were applied to the 28 impact types and 105 quantitative studies to produce the 22 quantitative impacts and 20 qualitative impacts in the report. In particular, the following questions should be addressed here or in the appendix:
> -	What were the 28 identified impact types?
> -	When was the literature review performed, and with what search and filtering methodology?
> -	Were there any identified impact types that were not included in the 20+22 studied impact types?
> Ch. 2, Figure 2-2	The time series shows repeated patterns over time, and this is expected given the methodology, but the specific timing of those patterns is not what would be expected. According to Appendix A, the 30-year timeseries are used for each of the 30-year future periods. That would result in the historical pattern being reproduced 2020 – 2049, 2040 – 2069 (with an overlap), and 2070 – 2099. Instead, the pattern is repeated 2020 – 2049, 2050 – 2079, and then the last 20 years are repeated 2080-2099.
> Ch. 2, lines 641-648	While population projections are based on SSP2 (lines 625-626), GDP projections use AEO. It would be more consistent to use the GDP projections that are already included in the SSP database for SSP2. In particular, any inconsistency in  the assumptions between the population and GDP projections will result in problematic income projections. GDP scales with population, so this inconsistency could result in GDP per capita estimates that are significantly higher or lower than they should be.
> Ch. 2, lines 663 - 665	(1)	Incomes in New York State are much higher than the national average. It is not clear if this is accounted for.
> (2)	Incomes are much higher in urban areas than in rural areas. It is not clear that this is accounted for.
> The country-level GDP projections provide a fine basis for scaling baseline income differences. In the absence of some handling of these differences, the economic impact estimates will not be representative of the NY population.
> Ch. 2, lines 722 - 724	Statistical uncertainty is a crucial element of the accurate description of climate risks. In many cases, the combination of impact, climate, and socioeconomic uncertainty result in relatively long tails, so that there is a significant probability of impacts multiple times the expected impact. Also, an economic assessment should provide the necessary information to make economic decisions, and uncertainty is an important input to those. While it may not be possible for every impact, uncertainty should be represented when possible.
> Ch. 2, Table 2-2	(1)	GCMs are generally not adequate to describe the range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity. A comparison between GCM uncertainty and simple climate model uncertainty should be provided.
> (2)	Structural uncertainty across impact models remains large for most sectors, despite the most recent available data and models. Statistical and process-based models, in particular, typically produce very different results.
> Ch. 3, line 71	Significant complexity in this equation just comes from translating temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. While this is an important step, keeping each translation grouped with each instance of Tmax obfuscates the equation. Even the 0.55 cancels with the 1.8. The final equation only has 3 terms: A + B Tmax + C RH Tmax.
> Ch. 3, line 70	I believe that the August-Roche-Magnus requires contemporaneous dew point temperature, not baseline temperature. Holding dew point temperature at baseline values while increasing air temperature will result in lower relative humidity values, and consequently lower impacts.
> Ch. 3, line 74	Tmax in equation 1 is defined as the daily maximum (line 69), but later an expression is used to calculate THI on an hourly basis. These are inconsistent.
> Ch. 3, lines 91 – 95, 266 - 268	The calculation for milk and crop losses assumes that prices do not change. However, since these effects will be experienced everywhere and NY is the fourth-largest producer, milk prices will increase. Similarly, the demand for corn, soybeans, and wheat are fairly inelastic, so we expect the loss in yields to be almost entirely offset by an increase in prices. The total impact for producers will depend upon the relative impact on NY compared to other states.
> Ch. 3, lines 217 - 218	It is unclear why the milk analysis is performed at the county-level, while the analysis of fied crops is for 12 assessment regions. I believe this is the first time those regions have been mentioned in the document.
> Ch. 3, lines 235 - 236	Since temperature and precipitation are also correlated, the temperature variable that has the highest correlation may not be the most informative variable when combined with precipitation.
> Ch. 3, lines 243 - 244	Model fit statistics (e.g., R2) should be provided for each crop (and ideally for each region, e.g. in a map). Since the emulation process is inexact (a 0.6 R2 is low for an emulator), it will compound modeling errors, and this information is needed to understand the reliability of the results.
> Ch. 3, lines 250 - 251	Much more information is needed for the regression model for hay. It may be that the 1980 – 2022 data mentioned in Table 3-6 was used for this regression, but that is not clear. Were counties pooled, and if so, were county-specific intercepts and regional trends included? Was the yield variable logged? Was a positive or negative coefficient found for season growing mean temperature? Typically, we would expect a kink in the temperature relationship, and without modeling the kink, the model would not be expected to work well under climate change. What model fit statistics were found?
> Ch. 3, lines 258 - 260	Differences in data handling can add bias to the results. First, was the process for generating daily data from the CMIP5 data that was used by Beach et al. (2015) the same as the process for calculating CMIP6 daily data? The same method should be used. Second, the emulator data used 5-year averages, while the projection data used 30-year averages. How were these ensured to be consistent?
> Ch. 3, lines 266 - 267	A single year is used to generate the ratio relationship between true and simulated yield. This is a crucial step, since there could be many factors that are different between the farming assumptions used in Beach et al. (2015) and actual farming. Since a single year is used (rather than, e.g., a 5-year average) and a constant ratio is used (rather than, e.g., a regression model showing how the two relate with possibly other variables), there is a high potential for spuriously high or low yields which will result in spuriously sensitive or insensitive climate impacts.
> Ch. 3, Table 3-15, lines 581 - 584	It is not clear how this $3.6m is calculated. I would expect that the calculation is $27,658,000 (2.8e6 / (2.8e6 + 620800)), but this results in a loss of $22.6m.
> Ch. 3, lines 266 – 268; Ch. 4, lines 144 – 145	Some sectors let prices grow with income (e.g., wages for labor) while others do not (e.g., crop prices, recreational fishing expenditures, winter recreation). It is not clear why.
> Ch. 4, lines 130 - 133	How do wages in periods of expansion compare to wages in periods of contraction? If they are higher (which seems plausible), then the methodology will underestimate the lost wages.
> Ch. 4, lines 174 - 177	There are a number of macroeconomic consequences that are not considered. (1) Lost wages have a multiplier effect, resulting in additional reduced economic activity. (2) Reductions in time spent in labor could result in increases in labor demand and/or wage rates, offsetting the losses; and (3) if we assume that workers garner their marginal product, there is a further multiplier from lost intermediate inputs to other sectors.
> Ch. 4, lines 307 - 313	The assumption is that anglers distribute themselves uniformly across streams in a HUC-8. However, it seems plausible that they will distribute according to their home location (population density), and that the availability of a stream range is not a limiting factor. In particular, if people do distribute themselves uniformly irrespective of distance to travel, they would presumably maintain the same share of cold/warm fishing, as long as there exists any cold fishing within the Northeast region. 
> Ch. 4, lines 327 – 329	-	Suppose that HUC #1 contained 100% of streams in a region, and that 60% of the coldwater fisheries of the Northeast converted to warmwater. The described ratio would say that 167% of coldwater miles are lost to HUC #1. The problem becomes worse when the coldwater miles change is near 0.
> -	20 / 60 is 1/3rd (approximately 33%, not 30%).
> Ch. 4, lines 351 - 354	It is now explained what the independent variable is for these interpolations (local near-surface air temperature?), nor shown how plausible this approximation is.
> Ch. 4, lines 544 - 547	The following section on outdoor activities addresses this by using the Recreation Use Value Database. It is not clear why this was not done here.
> 	Society and economy: What about the production losses associated with the labor impacts?
> 	Energy: What about heat savings, and greater cooling expenditures?
> 	
> 	Health: Adapt assumpts say increased A/C and market penetration, so not clear what “greater” A/C use means.
>  	
> 	
> Ap. A, pg. 1-3	The climate downscaling approach invites some avoidable errors.
> (1)	PRISM data is already derived from stations, using a distance-based (multivariate kriging) approach. Rather than using Theissen polygons, the team could have used the same approach as PRISM using the station data, and would have achieved the same result as PRISM. In other words, wherever the monthly coefficient derived using the approach here is not equal to 0 for temperature and 1 for precipitation, it is attributable to using a sub-standard method of extrapolating from stations to grids.
> (2)	This also results in artificial spatial discontinuities, as seen in Figure A-2 between Rochester and Syracuse. Similar temporal discontinuities will occur at month boundaries.

> Methodology
> 58 This analysis focuses on the subset of infrastructure-climate stressor combinations from Fant et
> 59 al. (2020) that (a) can be characterized with reasonable certainty and (b) are likely to have
> 60 significant costs. Meeting the first criterion requires usable projections of the climate stressor

> 67 wildfire impacts in Fant et al. focused solely on the Western U.S., and even there the impacts
> 68 caused by burned areas were minor compared to other climate stressors.
> 69 The impacts included for New York State are listed in Table 6-2 (further details follow) and shows
> 70 the data and sources for this work. Table 6-2 also summarizes the approach used to simulate
> 71 adaptation for each of the stressors under three adaptation scenarios: No adaptation, Reactive,
> 72 and Proactive. These three scenarios represent a range of potential adaptation effort, but are not

> 78 design/model at the end of its life cycle.
> 79 For the Reactive and Proactive Adaptation strategies, utilities respond by “designing”
> 80 infrastructure to either recent climate (reactive) or an expected future climate (proactive) based
> 81 on climate projections. This is done by upgrading infrastructure until it meets the baseline

> 121 adaptation), or existing lines will have ampacity upgrades (i.e., replacement with higher capacity

> Can you provide any relevant comments, along the lines of the ones I offer on other sections above?
**assistant**:
> Given your insightful critiques of other sections, here are some potential comments for the Energy Transmission and Distribution Infrastructure analysis:
> 
> 1. **Methodology Coherence and Uncertainty**:
> "While the methodology describes a sensible approach to evaluating stressor impacts on infrastructure, the exclusion of specific climate stressors such as high winds and ice storms due to uncertainty may present a critical gap in the assessment. Acknowledging these uncertainties is essential, but developing a methodology to incorporate even high-uncertainty factors into a comprehensive risk assessment might provide a more complete picture of potential vulnerabilities."
> 
> 2. **Adaptation Scenarios**:
> "The division into 'No Adaptation,' 'Reactive,' and 'Proactive' scenarios is a good framework for understanding different levels of response to climate change. However, the document could benefit from a clearer explanation of the criteria used to simulate adaptations for each stressor. Moreover, a discussion on the effectiveness and feasibility of these adaptations, along with their cost implications, would be of high value. How do these scenarios compare in terms of long-term economic impact, taking into account the potential for over or under-designing infrastructure?"
> 
> 3. **Data and Assumptions**:
> "The reliance on Fant et al. (2020) for selecting impacts and modeling adaptation strategies raises questions about the contemporaneity and regional applicability of those findings to New York's specific context. It would be beneficial to critically review these assumptions and consider newer studies or localized data that may offer more accurate or relevant insights."
> 
> 4. **Impact of Excluded Climate Stressors**:
> "While it's understood that wildfires and certain other stressors have been excluded from this analysis based on limited data or perceived impact, considering New York's unique geography and climate, reevaluating these exclusions could be worthwhile. Particularly, the implications of disregarding stressors could be discussed within the context of cumulative risk, recognizing that combined smaller risks could still pose significant threats."
> 
> 5. **Detailed Examination of Vegetation Management**:
> "The analysis posits a linear relationship between climate change and vegetation growth management costs. However, this simplification may not fully capture the complexities and variabilities of vegetation dynamics under changing climatic conditions. A more nuanced model that includes a range of responses to different precipitation and temperature scenarios could offer a more detailed and accurate assessment of management needs and costs."
> 
> 6. **Infrastructure Lifespan and Replacement Costs**:
> "The focus on transformer and wood pole lifespan reductions is appropriate but appears to assume static future costs for replacements and upgrades. The analysis could be deepened by incorporating projected changes in material costs, technological advancements, and economic conditions that could affect the cost-effectiveness of various adaptation strategies."
> 
> 7. **Socioeconomic and Environmental Co-Benefits or Trade-offs**:
> "While the section focuses on the direct impact on energy infrastructure, integrating considerations of how these adaptation strategies intersect with broader socioeconomic and environmental objectives or challenges could enrich the analysis. For instance, are there co-benefits of certain adaptation strategies that enhance community resilience or biodiversity? Alternatively, could some adaptations have negative ecological or social repercussions?"
> 
> Your critiques and recommendations invariably should aim to improve the methodological rigor, inclusiveness, and practical relevance of the analysis, ensuring it serves as a truly comprehensive and actionable guide for policymakers and stakeholders in New York State.
**user**:
> Does the section address adaptation costs?
**assistant**:
> Based on the provided methodology for the Energy Transmission and Distribution Infrastructure analysis, it does not explicitly mention a detailed assessment of adaptation costs. The focus appears to be on evaluating the impacts of climate stressors on infrastructure and modeling different adaptation scenarios (No Adaptation, Reactive, Proactive) in terms of adjusting infrastructure design to historical or projected climate conditions.
> 
> To provide a more comprehensive analysis, it would be beneficial to incorporate an evaluation of the associated costs for implementing these adaptation strategies. Understanding the financial implications of different adaptation pathways is crucial for decision-makers to prioritize investments, allocate resources effectively, and ensure the resilience and sustainability of the energy infrastructure in the face of climate change.
> 
> You may consider recommending an addition to the analysis that explicitly assesses and quantifies the costs associated with implementing each adaptation scenario. This information could provide valuable insights into the economic feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and trade-offs of different adaptation measures, helping stakeholders make informed decisions regarding infrastructure resilience planning and investment prioritization.
