> ## Ocean Observing Sites in Delaware Marine Waters
> 
> The current map illustrates a constellation of ocean observing assets located within U.S. waters, prominently featuring Delaware's own marine territories. These assets represent crucial sites for scientific observation, encompassing a diverse array of platforms and gauges. These data-collection instruments are strategically positioned to seamlessly monitor an assortment of physical parameters, providing invaluable information for our understanding of oceanic dynamics. These parameters typically include data related to surface and underwater currents, sea surface temperature, salinity profiles, wave heights, and potentially coastal meteorological data, among other variables. These sites constitute an essential part of our stewardship of marine environments and our efforts towards global sustainability. Through continuous and meticulous observation, we can amass a wealth of knowledge about our oceans, responding effectively to changes, and shipping a sustainable future for Delaware's marine ecosystems.
