> Dear [Recipient's Name],
> 
> I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is James Rising and I am writing this Letter of Intent on behalf of the National Building Performance Standards Coalition (Coalition), for which I play an active and invested role. Our mission is to achieve substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions through improved building policies. Despite the new federal administration deciding not to continue supporting our effort, our commitment and dedication to the cause are unfaltering.
> 
> The Coalition includes 48 jurisdictions and delivers cost savings that impact 25% of the nation's commercial building stock. Since its incubation in 2022 with the financial and administrative support of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), the Coalition has shown significant outcomes and garnered consistent growth. Now we are seeking the necessary resources to independently continue our crucial work. To this end, we are turning to New York Community Trust, a beacon of sustainable development and commitment to local communities, to consider supporting our initiatives.
> 
> In January 2022, we launched the forefront initiative with IMT to drive local and state governments towards formulating equitable Building Performance Standards (BPS). These standards seek to improve both new and existing buildings, having ripple effects across climate objectives, indoor air quality, resilience against extreme weather, job creation, energy cost reduction, and frontline communities' quality of life. Our Coalition's strong stand encompasses 6 states and 42 localities, representing a comprehensive and collaborative attempt to address climate justice issues.
> 
> Our Coalition’s initiatives continue to prompt significant climate action in both the public and private sectors. The Coalition's efforts are frequently recognized and cited by real estate professionals, policymakers, and journalists as an accelerating force for climate action in the built environment. Recently, IMT's webinar series on building performance standards attracted more than 900 registrants from governments, nonprofits, and real estate organizations/associations, demonstrating further the growing interest in, and crucial need for, these initiatives.
> 
> At this pivotal time, our ask is funding of $150,000, a portion of the needed $2.5M, to enable IMT to continue to manage the Coalition's infrastructure and support our members. Our intent is to maintain the momentum of building decarbonization and climate justice, both essential in weaving a future of sustainable, equitable, and resilient growth. 
> 
> We have full faith that with your backing, we will be able to disrupt the status quo and usher in robust policies that align with our mission. We would be enthralling to discuss potential partnership with your esteemed entity and how our shared visions of a sustainable and thriving future can be mutually fortified.
> 
> Thank you for considering our request, and we anticipate the opportunity for further discussion. Let's continue to build the sustainable world we want to bequeath to our future generations.

**assistant**:
> Dear [Recipient's Name],
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. My name is James Rising, and I am reaching out on behalf of the National Building Performance Standards Coalition (Coalition) to discuss a unique funding opportunity that could significantly impact our shared mission of driving substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions through effective building policies.
> 
> As you may be aware, the new federal administration has decided not to support President Biden's National Building Performance Standards Coalition, a vital initiative committed to improving building policies for better environmental outcomes. Despite this setback, we remain steadfast in our goal to catalyze change and drive progress in this crucial field.
> 
> The Coalition, comprising 48 jurisdictions and influencing cost savings for 25% of the nation's commercial building stock, has been tirelessly supported by the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) since its inception in 2022. However, in light of recent developments, we are seeking resources to sustain the Coalition's important work even in the absence of White House endorsement.
> 
> In summary, our objective is to maintain the momentum on building decarbonization and climate justice, requiring funding of $150,000 as part of the larger $2.5M+ needed to support IMT in managing the Coalition infrastructure and providing essential member support. This funding is crucial in ensuring the continuation of our impactful initiatives and projects.
> 
> One such project proposal plan that we are excited about is the development of a National Movement Infrastructure for SEBP scope. This initiative involves mapping all SEBP (Sustainable Energy Building Performance) Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) to create a comprehensive guide for our Coalitions' Collective Impact team. Additionally, we are working on a general CBO/ecosystem mapping guide for IMT, enhancing our capacity to engage with and support local communities effectively.
> 
> Under the BPS PATH initiative, we plan to conduct meetings with CBOs or community representatives to better understand their needs and priorities regarding BPS policy compliance and support. This includes engaging SEBP CBOs in SEBP locations to ensure a holistic and inclusive approach. Furthermore, a dedicated working group will be formed to focus on workshop development and equity, with representation from CBOs specialized in workforce development.
> 
> Through the GGRF (Green Grant Reforestation Fund) project, we aim to connect CBOs with the lender ecosystem, as suggested in several Request for Proposal (RFP) responses and illustrated in other successful examples such as IoF and WPF. This strategic partnership will not only streamline processes but also foster collaboration and innovation in advancing our collective goals.
> 
> We strongly believe that your support and partnership could catalyze significant positive change and drive lasting impact in our mission to combat climate change and promote sustainable building practices. We would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how we can work together to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
> 
> Thank you for considering our proposal, and we eagerly await the possibility of collaborating with New York Community Trust to make a meaningful difference in our communities and beyond.

**assistant**:
> Dear [Recipient's Name],
> 
> I am reaching out on behalf of the National Building Performance Standards Coalition to express our earnest need for support in advancing our critical mission aimed at achieving substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through improved building policies. Given recent shifts in federal support, it has become imperative for us to seek alternative resources to ensure the continuity of our efforts in driving positive change.
> 
> The Coalition, encompassing 48 jurisdictions and influencing cost savings for a significant portion of the nation's commercial building stock, has been supported by the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) since its inception in 2022. As we navigate this transition period without White House endorsement, we are seeking additional resources to sustain our momentum and impact in the field of building decarbonization and climate justice.
> 
> In order to effectively resourcing the Coalition and managing the necessary infrastructure and member support, we are in need of funding totaling $2.5 million or more for IMT. This financial support will enable us to continue our vital work in supporting equitable Building Performance Standards (BPS) and enhancing policies and programs that improve existing buildings across various states and localities.
> 
> Our initiative, launched in January 2022 with the endorsement of President Biden, has already made significant strides in supporting local and state governments in their commitment to equitable BPS and sustainable building practices. This work is crucial in achieving climate objectives at the local and state levels, while also fostering improvements in indoor air quality, resilience to extreme weather events, job creation, and reductions in energy costs for residents and businesses. Moreover, by centering frontline communities in the policymaking process, we are actively addressing climate justice issues in a comprehensive manner.
> 
> The impact of the Coalition extends beyond the public sector, spurring action in the private sector as well. Real estate professionals, policymakers, and journalists consistently point to the Coalition as evidence of accelerated climate action within the built environment, stimulating important discussions on industry and policy transformation. Notably, IMT's recent webinar series on building performance standards attracted over 900 registrants from various sectors, showcasing the broad interest and support for our initiatives.
> 
> To further expand our impact and enhance community engagement, we have developed a project proposal plan that includes the establishment of a National Movement Infrastructure for Sustainable Energy Building Performance (SEBP) scope. This initiative involves mapping all SEBP Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and developing a comprehensive guide for our Collective Impact team. Additionally, we are working on a general CBO/ecosystem mapping guide to enhance our outreach capabilities.
> 
> The proposed project, named BPS PATH, aims to conduct meetings with CBOs and community representatives to better understand their needs and priorities regarding BPS policy compliance and support. This may include engaging SEBP CBOs in SEBP locations to ensure a tailored and inclusive approach. To support workshop development and equity initiatives, a dedicated working group will be formed with representation from CBOs specializing in workforce development.
> 
> Furthermore, under the Green Grant Reforestation Fund (GGRF) project, we plan to connect CBOs with the lender ecosystem, as highlighted in various Request for Proposal (RFP) responses and exemplified in successful initiatives such as IoF and WPF. This strategic collaboration will streamline processes and foster innovation in advancing our shared goals.
> 
> To provide a clear roadmap for the successful implementation of this project, we have outlined a Scope of Work for the one-year funding period:
> 
> 1. Mapping of all SEBP CBOs using the developed guide and completion of the general CBO/ecosystem mapping guide for IMT.
> 2. Conduct meetings with CBOs and community representatives to assess needs and priorities related to BPS policy compliance and support, with a focus on SEBP locations if applicable.
> 3. Establish a working group dedicated to workshop development and equity, including experts from CBOs specializing in workforce development.
> 4. Facilitate connections between CBOs and the lender ecosystem to enhance financial support and collaboration, drawing from successful models like IoF and WPF.
> 
> We believe that with your support and partnership, we can continue to drive positive change and make a lasting impact on building decarbonization and climate justice efforts. Your investment in our initiatives will not only benefit current stakeholders but will also pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient future for generations to come.
> 
> Thank you for considering our proposal, and we look forward to the possibility of collaborating with New York Community Trust to bring this vision to fruition.
