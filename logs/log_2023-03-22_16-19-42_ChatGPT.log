> "Braiding Sweetgrass" by Robin Wall Kimmerer is a beautiful and insightful book that explores the intersection of indigenous wisdom and scientific knowledge. While there are several chapters that could provide thought-provoking material for a class on the Philosophy of Research, one chapter that stands out is "Allegiance to Gratitude."
> 
> In this chapter, Kimmerer explores the importance of gratitude as a guiding principle in scientific research. She argues that scientific research often focuses on what we can learn from nature, but it rarely considers what we owe to nature. Kimmerer suggests that we need to cultivate a deeper sense of gratitude for the gifts that nature provides, and that this gratitude should guide our research and our actions towards the natural world.
> 
> Kimmerer's perspective challenges some of the assumptions and values that underpin scientific research, such as objectivity, detachment, and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. By emphasizing the importance of gratitude, she suggests that research should be grounded in a sense of responsibility and reciprocity towards the natural world. This chapter could spark a rich discussion about the role of values and ethics in research, and how these values might shape the questions we ask, the methods we use, and the impact our research has on the world around us.
