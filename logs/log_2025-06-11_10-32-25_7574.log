> In ggplot, can I get a facet_grid but with the amount of vertical space given to each panel differing by the number of y values in that panel?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can achieve this effect in `ggplot2` by using the `facet_grid()` function in combination with `space = "free_y"`. This allows each facet to have a different amount of vertical space based on the number of y values in that panel. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you might set it up:
> 
> ```r
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Sample data
> data <- data.frame(
>   group = rep(1:3, each = 10),
>   x = rep(1:10, 3),
>   y = c(rnorm(10), rnorm(10, 5), rnorm(10, 10))
> )
> 
> # ggplot with facet_grid and space = "free_y"
> ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
>   geom_point() +
>   facet_grid(rows = vars(group), scales = "free_y", space = "free_y")
> ```
> 
> In this example, `facet_grid(rows = vars(group), scales = "free_y", space = "free_y")` creates a grid of panels with free y scales and different vertical spaces proportional to the range of y values in each group. Adjust the data and aesthetics to fit your specific use case!
