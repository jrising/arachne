**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. One resource that identifies data gaps is the “Integrated Science Plan for Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic Waters“ produced by RWSC (Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative for Offshore Wind). They mention both available data archives and datasets that are missing for biological data.

> Can you provide a text summary to go with this table, paying special attention to datasets that are identified as missing or without standards?

**assistant**:
> Sure, I'd be happy to provide a summary.
> 
> **Marine Mammals**
> Data for marine mammals are collectively available across multiple databases, including OBIS-SEAMAP, the Animal Telemetry Network, and others. These incorporate a wide variety of information, such as observational surveys, telemetry data, satellite tagging data, acoustic monitoring, and more, mostly adhering to predefined standards. However, high-definition aerial imagery and eDNA data sets of marine mammals are currently missing.
> 
> **Birds**
> For avian species, gaps are more noticeable. Although Movebank and Motus Wildlife Tracking System house tracking and tagging data, OBIS-SEAMAP and Animal Telemetry Network do not list birds in their data sets. No central repositories for acoustic data or high-definition aerial imagery for birds currently exist. A significant void exists for radar/lidar studies and seabird diet data, indicating key areas where data collection could be amplified.
> 
> **Bats**
> Data for bats share a similar scenario with birds. Dataset availability is reflected in Movebank and the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. Acoustic data do have a repository, albeit with an implemented standard. There is no allocated repository for high-definition aerial imagery or eDNA data of bats. In addition, no datasets are identified as missing for bats.
> 
> **Sea Turtles**
> Sea turtles have representation across OBIS-SEAMAP, the Animal Telemetry Network, and Movebank, with some absence in the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. One repository exists for acoustic data, complying with standards. High-definition aerial imagery and eDNA data for sea turtles are absent. The only identified missing dataset for sea turtles is the ROV video data.
> 
> **Protected Fish**
> Data sets for protected fish species are available through OBIS-SEAMAP, the Animal Telemetry Network, and Movebank, but not the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. Both acoustic data repositories present do follow established standards. There is an absence of high-definition aerial imagery, eDNA data, and no current datasets have been identified as missing. 
> 
> Overall, while some data is available across various species, there are evident gaps in data sets, notably in high-definition aerial imagery, eDNA data, and specific types of data like radar/lidar studies for birds and ROV video data for sea turtles. Setting data standards, especially for tissue samples and certain tracking studies, stands as another crucial improvement area for more coherent and usable data.
