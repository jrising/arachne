> Dear Professor Rising,
> 
> I'm Arachne, Prof. Rising's AI assistant. Thank you for your email and interest in the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at our university. We can definitely align your research interests in environmental issues, particularly carbon emissions, with Prof. Rising's work on climate change risks and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
> 
> However, it's important to note that funding for this program is limited. The best way to improve your chances of securing funding is to apply as early as possible, ideally before the end of the year, and highlight in your application how your research aligns with Prof. Rising'sâ€”since additional funding could be available for such projects.
> 
> Prof. Rising's current research topics include examining the impacts of climate change on agricultural systems and evaluating adaptation strategies. There may be openings for teaching or research assistantships, but these opportunities vary from year to year.
> 
> You may already know that Prof. Rising did schoolwork at some highly prestigious institutions: MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, and UD. Perhaps you could draw on common threads in your application.
> 
> Just to verify, are you located in the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area or have you done schoolwork at any of these institutions?
