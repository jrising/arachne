>  My name is Ebenezer Oduro, and I am writing to express my deep interest in pursuing a master’s degree in Environmental economics at the University of Delaware under your esteemed guidance and mentorship. Having extensively researched your work and ongoing projects with your team on the impacts of Climate Change bringing together empirical estimates and integrated assessment model, I am incredibly fascinated and inundated with desires to work with you and also gain ardent combinatorial knowledge in macroeconomics on Climate Change: financial risk and opportunities, mitigation strategies, transitioning to net-zero, Science, Economics, and Policies of Climate Change and the environment and Economics of Adaptation. With my prospectivity and plethora of knowledge in Economics, I want to express my desire of joining your team to undertake collaborative research on Climate Risk for Many other countries aside the one you have done for the UK. Reading through this research under your tutelage fills me with excitement and a strong desire to contribute my quota to this cutting-edge field. My academic background and research interest align perfectly with the proposed research area you are currently exploring. Specifically, I am keen on furthering my learnings gained from the recent COP 28 where the world at the brink of Climate disaster met to plan on how to commit to 1.5 degrees warming limit, end the fossils fuel age and deliver climate justice. My goal is to gain knowledge on how these COP goals can be achieved without it affecting countries long built macro-economic stability. The breadth and depth of your academic achievements and research expertise in assessing Climate Change Risk using integrated assessment model, makes you an ideal mentor for my research journey. I am confident that working under your guidance will not only further my academic growth but also enable me to make significant contributions to the field of Transition to Net-zero emission in the Ghana and Africa’s energy sector. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Economics with Mathematics at the University of Ghana, in 2021, achieving a cumulative grade point average of 3.03(US WES transcript evaluation). My desire to be a Climate Change expert led me to undertook some Climate Change courses introduced by the IMF on edx. I took courses such as financial risk and opportunities, mitigation strategies, transitioning to net-zero, Science, Economics, and Policies of Climate Change. I learnt about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2021 report that points to widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. I came to realize that human influence has warmed the Climate at an unprecedented rate in at least the last 2000 years. This made me realize that, the macro-relevance of Climate Change is now beyond doubt. That is why the major international organizations like the IMF and the World bank group are all making efforts with the overarching goal of providing a common framework to understand issues at the intersection of macroeconomics and Climate Change. Their ultimate goal is to expand member countries’ capacity to translate their Climate target into practical policy actions that factor in country-specific circumstances, maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon economy. These courses gave me invaluable experience on Climate Change issues. I learnt about models such as carbon pricing and green hydrogen as some of the important methods to help drive the Net zero emission target as it was also discussed under the recent COP 28. The courses have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to undertake the Environmental Economics program at your institution. Professor James Rising, your expertise in Climate Risk assessment and helping communities use new technologies to help support sustainability and promote social justice is widely recognized in the field. Your guidance and mentorship would be invaluable to me throughout my research trajectory at the University of Delaware. I Kindly request your support and sponsorship for my research endeavors, as I am confident that your mentorship will shape my academic and professional development significantly. I understand the demands on your time, but I would be grateful if you could spare a moment to review my request and provide me with your valuable feedback. I am yet to submit my application and I strongly believe you will accept my application. I have attached my CV and Transcript for your perusal, and I am more than willing to arrange a remote meeting via zoom or any channel to discuss my research objectives, conceptualization and aspirations in detail. I eagerly, anticipate the possibility of collaborating with you and contributing to advancement of knowledge in the field of Climate Risk assessment for various countries. I am looking forward to hear from you soon.

> Based on the email, Ebenezer Oduro is expressing interest in the Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters) program. Ebenezer lays out his experience and current interests in interrelated subjects such as climate change risk, financial opportunities and mitigation strategies, transitioning to net-zero emission, and policies of climate change. Moreover, Ebenezer expresses desire to undertake collaborative research on Climate Risk. His educational background is in Economics with Mathematics from the University of Ghana. He has also taken several courses on climate change introduced by the IMF on edx.

> Dear Ebenezer,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. It seems like the Masters in Environmental Economics program or potentially the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics could align well with your strong background and distinct interests in climate change, economics, and integrated assessment modeling. Working on such issues could indeed be fascinating and impactful. 
> 
> However, I must note that the EE Masters is a self-funded program. For the Ph.D. program, funding can be a constraint in our ability to accept students. For these reasons, I'd encourage you to apply as soon as you can so that you can be considered for any available funds.
> 
> Your research goals seem quite congruent with work I and others do here, so it may be worth mentioning how your interests align with mine specifically in your statement of purpose.
