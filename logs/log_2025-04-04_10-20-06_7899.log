> In the UK, the Environment Agency is a non-departmental public body, which means it operates independently but is sponsored by a government department. Specifically, it is sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra). 
> 
> The Environment Agency is tasked with protecting and improving the environment, which includes regulating waste management, water resources, and managing flood risks, among other responsibilities. Defra, on the other hand, is the government department responsible for policy and regulation in areas such as the environment, food, and rural affairs.
> 
> In essence, the Environment Agency implements and enforces environmental policies and regulations developed by Defra. Defra oversees the strategic direction and funding of the Environment Agency, ensuring that its operations align with broader governmental environmental goals. This relationship allows for a consistent approach to environmental management across the UK.
