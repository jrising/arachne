**user**:
> I am trying to make a TTS tool that reads out sentences as they come in from another service. I am adding sentences to a queue, and then my thread that reads them out goes like this:
> ```
> def tts_consumer(qq):
>     channel = pygame.mixer.find_channel()
> 
>     ii = 0
>     while True:
>         sentence = qq.get()

>         
>         my_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("waves/tts" + str(ii) + ".wav")
>         channel.queue(my_sound)
> 
>         qq.task_done()  # Signal that a formerly enqueued task is complete

**assistant**:
> It appears that the missing sentences issue may be due to the `pygame.mixer.Sound` object not being kept alive long enough for the sound to finish playing. Essentially, when a `Sound` object is garbage collected, the `Sound` stops playing.
> 
> In Python, it's important to keep in mind that when a variable referencing an object goes out of scope or is reassigned, and no other references to that object exist, that object is eligible to be cleaned up by the garbage collector. If your `my_sound` instances are no longer referenced after each iteration of your loop, they are likely being garbage-collected before the sound has had a chance to finish playing (or, in some cases, to start playing).
> 
> One way around this issue is to keep references to your `Sound` instances until you're sure they have finished playing. Here is a revised version of your `tts_consumer` function that stores `Sound` objects in a list:
> 
> ```python
> def tts_consumer(qq):
>     channel = pygame.mixer.find_channel()
> 
>     ii = 0
>     sound_objects = []  # A list to keep track of Sound instances
>     while True:
>         sentence = qq.get()
> 
>         print("Generate " + sentence)
>         tts.tts_to_file(text=sentence, file_path="waves/tts" + str(ii) + ".wav")
> 
>         my_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("waves/tts" + str(ii) + ".wav")
>         sound_objects.append(my_sound)  # Append the Sound instance to the list
>         channel.queue(my_sound)
> 
>         qq.task_done()  # Signal that a formerly enqueued task is complete
> 
>         # Clean up finished Sound instances from the list
>         sound_objects = [sound for sound in sound_objects if pygame.mixer.get_busy()]
> 
>         ii += 1
> ```
> 
> Here, after a sound is created it is appended to `sound_objects`, and they are kept there until after their sound has no longer playing (checked with the `pygame.mixer.get_busy()` call). This prevents `Sound` instances from being garbage collected prematurely.
> 
> Please try this revised code to see if it rectifies the issue.
**user**:
> It still doesn't read every sentence. I'm also confused about the setup of this function. What is task_done saying, and why do I want an infinite loop?
**assistant**:
> I apologize for the confusion. Let's address your questions and revise the function accordingly.
> 
> The `task_done()` method is used in conjunction with the `join()` method of a `Queue` object to signal the completion of a previously enqueued task. In your code, after processing each sentence, `qq.task_done()` is called to indicate that the task (in this case, retrieving a sentence from the queue) is complete. By default, each call to `get()` on the queue corresponds to one task that needs to be completed.
> 
> The reason for the infinite loop in the `tts_consumer` function is to continuously process sentences as they become available in the queue. However, to avoid an actual infinite loop that would block other parts of your program, you need a way to exit the loop gracefully when necessary.
> 
> Let's revise the code to properly handle the tasks and implement a clean exit from the loop:
> 
> ```python
> def tts_consumer(qq):
>     channel = pygame.mixer.find_channel()
> 
>     sound_objects = []
>     exit_flag = False  # Flag indicating whether to exit the loop
>     while True:
>         # Check if there's an exit request and the queue is empty
>         if exit_flag and qq.empty():
>             break  # Exit the loop
> 
>         try:
>             sentence = qq.get(timeout=1)  # Timeout to allow for other code execution
>             print("Generate " + sentence)
>             tts.tts_to_file(text=sentence, file_path="waves/tts" + str(len(sound_objects)) + ".wav")
> 
>             my_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("waves/tts" + str(len(sound_objects)) + ".wav")
>             sound_objects.append(my_sound)
>             channel.queue(my_sound)
>             
>             qq.task_done()  # Signal that a formerly enqueued task is complete
> 
>         except queue.Empty:
>             # If the queue is empty and no sentences are coming, set the exit flag
>             exit_flag = True
>             
>         # Remove finished Sound instances from the list
>         sound_objects = [sound for sound in sound_objects if pygame.mixer.get_busy()]
> 
>     # Clean up any remaining sound objects before exiting
>     for sound in sound_objects:
>         sound.stop()
> 
> ```
> 
> In this revised version, a new `exit_flag` variable is introduced to handle the termination condition. When the queue is empty and no more sentences are coming, the loop will only exit if the `exit_flag` is set to `True`, which prevents prematurely terminating the loop when there might be more sentences coming in the future.
> 
> The code also incorporates a 1-second timeout for the `qq.get(timeout=1)` call, allowing other parts of your code to execute while waiting for new sentences. This timeout ensures that the loop periodically checks if there's an exit request, even if the queue remains empty.
> 
> Lastly, any remaining `Sound` objects in the `sound_objects` list are stopped before exiting the function to ensure that all sounds are properly handled.
> 
> Please give this revised code a try and let me know if it resolves the issue and clarifies the function's setup.
