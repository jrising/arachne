> Environmental health refers to the study and management of factors in the environment that can potentially affect human health. This field encompasses a wide range of topics, including air and water quality, food safety, waste management, occupational health, noise pollution, housing, and the impact of climate change on health.
> 
> The goal of environmental health is to prevent disease and create health-supportive environments. This involves understanding the direct and indirect impact of our surroundings (both natural and human-made) on our physical, mental, and social well-being. For example, polluted air or contaminated water can directly lead to diseases, while issues like climate change can indirectly influence health by exacerbating factors like heat stress or vector-borne diseases.
> 
> The World Health Organization (WHO) has noted that a significant portion of global disease burden can be attributed to environmental factors, highlighting the importance of this field. Environmental health professionals often work in public health departments, regulatory agencies, and private firms, working on everything from disaster response and hazardous materials management, to policy development and public health advocacy. They collaborate with various stakeholders to implement strategies that promote healthier environments and ultimately, healthier populations.
