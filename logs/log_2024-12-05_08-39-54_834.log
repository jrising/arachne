> 
> So first, let's sum all the stars:
> 
> (4 people * 5 stars) = 20 stars
> (4 people * 4 stars) = 16 stars
> (2 people * 3 stars) = 6 stars
> (1 person * 2 stars) = 2 stars
> 
> Total sum of stars = 20 + 16 + 6 + 2 = 44 stars
> 
> Next, we'll find the total number of reviewers, which is 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11 people.
> 
> Then we'll divide the total sum of stars by the total number of reviewers to get the average rating:
> 
> Average rating = 44 stars / 11 people = 4 stars.

> We are shifting the program with the goal of becoming a self funded program over the next few years. To achieve this, for the next cycle of Green Lease Leaders, we have added an application processing fee and are offering new paid services. These new services both support companies who need additional assistance with their green leasing work and help to shift the perception from GLL as a free program to GLL and green leasing is work that should be financially valued.
