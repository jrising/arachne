> My name is Ms Onyinyechi Chinenye Aghanwa. I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree with Second Class honors (Upper-division-2008) with a Cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.86 on a scale of 5 points in Maritime Management Technology and a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree (2017) with a Cumulative Grade Point Average of 4.16 on a scale of 5 points in Marine Transport Management both from Federal University of Technology Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. I am looking forward to starting a Phd  in  Marine Studies at the University of Delaware, United State of America  by September 2024 Fall Admission/Applications. I desire to work under your supervision.
> 
> I am interested in studying at the University of Delaware, United State of America particularly in your research laboratory which focuses on impacts of climate change thereby bringing together empirical estimates and integrated assessment models. Your research also focuses on modeling of social-environmental systems with concentrations on complex systems, food and fisheries, and resource management.
>

> My research tends to focus on “Assessment of the Impact of flooding on coastal areas”. Climate change threatens increased levels of flooding in the coastal and riverine flood plains. The coastlines change shape over time through natural processes, with climate change, human activity and existing flood defense putting many homes, businesses, and coastal communities at risk of flooding and abandonment. Coastal management techniques (Hard Engineering) is one approach that will aid the management of risk of erosion and flooding. This involves the placement of artificial structures which are used to stop or slow the natural processes of erosion, flooding and sea-rise level. I intend working with this tool to enable me to find solutions to the coastal and flooding issues ravaging the coastal communities. I have also embarked on a training programme on disaster management where I gained knowledge on these modules: risk assessment and mitigation, emergency preparedness and response, recovery and reconstruction, disaster management policies and governance.

> 
>  In my pursuit of a Master's degree (M.Sc.), I did courses in Maritime Safety and Security, Management of Marine Environment, Maritime Transportation and Risk Analysis, Port Operations and Management, Marine Insurance Law and Policy, Management of Ship operations, Maritime Engineering, For my B.Tech (Honors) dissertation, I conducted research on; ‘’Survey of Inland Water Transportation in Anambra State (Nigeria)’’. This has enabled me to gain research skills that will be an advantage in the pursuit of my doctoral degree.
> 
> My long-term career plan and goals is to become a Maritime Instructor and Safety Consultant, solving problems that may demand my expertise skills in the maritime industry. After my graduate studies, I intend cooperating with government agencies in Nigeria to work on a master plan and policies that will support mitigation of climate change. I will also volunteer and get involved with conservation organizations in Nigeria to sensitize and educate residents of the coastal communities on the knowledge of climate change and the adaptation measures.

**assistant**:
> Based on Ms. Aghanwa's email and given her interest in marine studies along with study focus on the impact of flooding on coastal areas, it seems she would be well suited to apply to the Ph.D. in Marine Policy program at the University of Delaware. Her interest in the impacts of climate change aligns well with your research. She also brings a unique perspective from her experience with maritime processes back in Nigeria.
> 
> She does not appear to be local to Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area or have schoolwork at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, based on what she included in her email. 
> 
> Questions or confusions:
> 1. She would need to be aware of the limited funding available for the Ph.D. in Marine Policy.
> 2. She has mentioned her desire to work under your supervision but has not specifically asked if you would be available or able to supervise her.
> 
> Here is a draft response:
> 
> Dear Aghanwa Onyinyechi Chinenye,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Based on your email, and thoughtful reflections, it's clear you have a firm grasp on the challenging issues facing marine policy, particularly those arising from climate change. 
> 
> It sounds like you would be a good candidate for our Ph.D. program in Marine Policy. I think your focus on the impact of flooding on coastal areas would align well with some of our ongoing projects. However, please be aware that funding for the Ph.D. program is limited.
> 
> I would strongly encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds. Given your research interests, it may be advantageous to mention me in your statement of purpose.
