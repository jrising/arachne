**user**:
> I am using scale_alpha_discrete to translate from a T/F column in ggplot to a transparency. How can I set what transparency level I want the T and F to be?
**assistant**:
> You cannot directly manipulate alpha levels with `scale_alpha_discrete()` because, as the name implies, it is meant for discrete variables and ggplot2 internally assigns alpha levels.
> 
> For finer control over alpha levels in ggplot2 based on a discrete variable (like a boolean T/F), you should use `scale_alpha_manual()`, where you can map specific alpha (transparency) levels to values. Each alpha level can range between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque).
> 
> Here's some example code:
> 
> ```r
> # Assume 'df' is your data frame and 'tf_col' is your T/F column
> ggplot(df, aes(....)) + 
>     geom_....(aes(alpha = tf_col), ...) +
>     scale_alpha_manual(values = c("T" = 0.1, "F" = 0.6))
> ```
> 
> This code maps the "T" boolean value to an alpha of 0.1 (quite transparent) and the "F" boolean value to an alpha of 0.6 (visible but somewhat transparent). Of course, adjust these alpha levels to your actual needs.
