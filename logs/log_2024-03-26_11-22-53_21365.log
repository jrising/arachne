> What is a good format for sharing a data frame from R to Julia? I want something space-efficient, but also with decent longevity.
**assistant**:
> Feather format may be the right format for you to share data frames between R and Julia. 
> 
> Feather provides a high-performance, language-agnostic data frame format based on the Apache Arrow columnar memory specification. This means that Feather is not only more space-efficient due to its binary format and compression, it can also be read by several other languages, including Python, R, and Julia. Its longevity is guaranteed by the backing of the Apache Software Foundation.

> In R, you can use the `arrow` package to save and load feather files:
>       
> ```r
> # To write a dataframe df to a Feather file:
> arrow::write_feather(df, "df.feather")
> 
> # To read a Feather file into a dataframe:
> df <- arrow::read_feather("df.feather")
> ```
> 
> In Julia, you can use the `Arrow.jl` package:
> 
> ```julia
> # To read a Feather file into a dataframe:
> df = Arrow.Table("df.feather") |> DataFrame
> 
> # To write a dataframe df to a Feather file:
> Arrow.write("df.feather", df)
> ```
> 
> However, be aware that Feather does not support all R data types. Most notably, it does not support lists, non-UTC date-times, and non-UTF-8 character strings. If your data frame contains any of the unsupported data types, you'll need to convert them into a supported form before saving in Feather.
> 
> Also, take into account that Feather does not provide extensive metadata handling capabilities (e.g., complex table schema). If you need extensive metadata handling, look into formats like Parquet or HDF5 which, while slightly less performant than Feather for some workloads, provide greater flexibility in storing complex types and metadata.
