> Dear Prof,
> 
> I hope this email finds you well. I am Adolf Avuletey, a current graduate student at Eastern Michigan University and a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant. 
> 
> I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing a Ph.D in Environmental Economics at your noble university. Having researched the outstanding academic programs and faculty at your esteemed institution, I am particularly drawn to your department's expertise and the innovative research conducted in the field of economics.
> 
> Additionally, I am very interested in working with you because your research interest is actually in line with mine; the issues of climate change and adaptation (environmental issues). Carbon emissions and its effect on the environment. 
> 
> Lastly, I have already submitted my Ph.D. application and I want to get in touch with you to let you know how much I like your research interest. I would especially want to know what research topics you are currently working on and whether there are any openings for teaching assistantships or research assistantships.
> 
> 
> Thank you very much for your consideration Sir. Below is my attached resume.

> Dear Adolf,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your strong interest in environmental economics and issues of climate change align well with the work being done here at our department, and I find your background in research a valuable addition.
> 
> Considering your experience and research interest, I think you would be a good candidate for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. However, I must note that funding is always a constraint in our ability to accept students. I see that you have already applied, which is great, as it allows you to be considered for any available funds.
> 
> In addition to me, there are several other faculty members in the department who might also be a good match for your research interests. I encourage you to reach out to them as well.
> 
> I appreciate your enthusiasm for my research. Presently, the focus of my work is on modeling the economics of climate change impacts, in areas like agriculture, energy, and water resources. Making a specific mention of faculty members, including me, in your statement of purpose when applying, specifying how your research interests align with ours, can often strengthen the application.
> 
> Regarding teaching assistantships or research assistantships, decisions on these positions usually occur after admission offers, closer to the start of the fall term.
> 
> This is an important decision, and I encourage you to continue your research about program fit. Applying early for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics is definitely a good first step, and your initiative is noted and appreciated.
> 
> Thanks again for reaching out, and happy holidays to you as well!
