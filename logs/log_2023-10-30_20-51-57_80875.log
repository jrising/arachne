> Suppose I have a Bayesian model with a gaussian variable; e.g., y ~ Normal(mu, sigma). mu and sigma are parameters of the Bayesian model. If I want to apply a non-informative prior to mu and sigma, should I just add no prior information? I have sometimes seen inverse-chi distributions applied to sigma and called non-informative. Is that appropriate?

> In Bayesian statistics, a non-informative prior is used to express a lack of prior knowledge. It's equivalent to saying, "I don't know anything about this parameter." However, to perform Bayesian inference, you must specify a prior distribution, even if it's non-informative.

> If you're modeling `y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)`, and you know nothing about `mu` or `sigma`, one common approach is to use broad, flat priors. This might mean using a Normal prior for `mu` with a large standard deviation, and a log-uniform or Half-Normal distribution for `sigma`.

> Coming to your specific question about inverse-chi-square distributions. The inverse-chi-square distribution is a common choice for a non-informative prior on variance parameters like `sigma^2` in a Normal distribution. It's often used because it's the conjugate prior for the variance of a normal distribution, meaning that the posterior distribution is in the same family as the prior distribution. This makes calculations more tractable.
> 
> However, there's a fundamental philosophical question about what we mean by non-informative. Some statisticians prefer to use flat priors like Uniform or a very wide Normal, arguing that these represent a true lack of prior information. But others, like Jaynes, argue that the inverse-chi-square is more truly non-informative, because it represents maximum entropy - the state of maximum uncertainty.

> In practice, for many models and datasets, the differences between these choices of priors often doesn't make much difference, especially when you have a good amount of data. If you're uncertain, it can be a good idea to try a few different priors and see if your results are sensitive to the choice of prior. Remember: Bayesian statistics is all about updating our beliefs in the face of new evidence. So whatever prior you start with, you're updating it with data to get your posterior.
