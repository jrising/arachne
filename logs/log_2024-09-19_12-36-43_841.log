> can you turn this into an email? "Theresa, Thanks for your contribution on today's call. I am feeling really positive about building this relationship with Hanna and WPC. I've looped in SBK and thank her for her thoughts as we propose a few pathways for followup. Some ideas first and an email drafted for your review below:
> 1. Long term: they are really interested in working on a resource together to help them grow their market. Coauthor/thought leadership. This is something I would like to work into a larger ask for membership (I said the 15 and 10K levels after you dropped off the call, and she said she would need to run those numbers by Treveor. She said she prefers to talk about money in a straightforward way, so I think that is resonated when I said our partnerships need to have a monetary component as well. 
> 2. Short term:  I think we encourage them to do a poster on what WPC is, and use the 10/16 as a way to introduce them to the community. I can help Hanna meet people at the event interested locally in financing and other CDFIS (have we invited others?) Get that $150 in and show them the value of the Hub network. 
> 3. I would like to immediately follow up with the following: Thank her for her time and openness to exploring what a collaboration on a resource or tool kit (a very practical guide, brass tacks stuff) is what she's most excited about.  Send the links to the tool kits we put in the chatResend the info on membership tiers and ask if it would be better for their budget cycle to put together a bespoke partnership  proposal (including a scope of work to do a webinar together or a written piece no less than $10K, and give them some level of recognition on the website). Some ideas for Climate week, I can share where I'm going and some finance focused events 
> Question for SBK/TB:1.  beyond supporting the hub, as a member, how do we think we can leverage their financial knowledge, work with other CDFIs?2. Should I track this in Asana? As a hub membership opportunity or under what heading?

> Dear Theresa,
> 
> I wanted to express my gratitude for your valuable insights on today's call. I'm feeling incredibly positive about the possibility of building a close and productive relationship with Hanna at WPC.
> 
> To that end, and in consideration of our conversation, I hope to propose a few pathways for continuing our dialogue. I've also looped in SBK to bring her thoughts into the mix.
> 
> 1. Long term: WPC's interest in the co-authorship of a resource to expand their market footprint is duly noted. I like the thought-leadership aspect of that. I would propose that we fold this into a larger membership ask; I mentioned the 15k and 10k tiers to Hanna after your departure and she appears open, pending a discussion with Treveor. Hanna prefers straightforward monetary conversations, a value I respect and share. Our partnership should, indeed, include a monetary aspect.
> 
> 2. Short term: Encouraging them to compile a poster on WPC for presentation on the 16th of October could serve as an introduction to our community. This could potentially spark interest and foster connections amongst local financing bodies and other CDFIs.
> 
> 3. Immediate actions: My next steps will include sending an acknowledgment of her willingness to explore collaboration and provide further information on the resources and membership tiers we discussed. It would be beneficial, given their budgeting timeline, to put together a tailored partnership proposal, which might include a shared webinar or written piece. This should not be less than $10k and would also give them a degree of recognition on our platform. Additionally, I plan to share some ideas for Climate week.
> 
> The following questions are open for your insight, and for SBK/TB:
> 
> 1. Beyond providing support to the hub, as a member, how do we best harness their financial expertise in our work with other CDFIs?
> 2. Perhaps I should track this potential partnership in Asana? If so, under what listing – membership opportunity, or something else?
