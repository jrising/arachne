**user**:
> Can you tell me a recipe for an excellent apple-pear tart (I have Granny Smiths and Bosc, for an adult discrimination of taste), with a pecan crust?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, here's a recipe for an apple-pear tart with a pecan crust that should satisfy adult taste buds. This recipe will serve about 8 people.
> 
> ## **Ingredients**
> 
> #### **For the Crust:**
> 
> - 1.5 cups of pecans
> - 1 cup of all-purpose flour
> - 2 tablespoons of sugar
> - 1/2 teaspoon of salt
> - 1/2 cup (1 stick) of cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
> - 2 tablespoons of ice water
> 
> #### **For the Filling:**
> 
> - 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter
> - 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced thinly
> - 2 Bosc pears, peeled, cored and sliced thinly
> - 1/4 cup of sugar
> - 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
> - 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
> - 2 teaspoons of lemon juice
> 
> #### **For the Glaze:**
> 
> - 2 tablespoons of apricot jam or honey
> - 1 tablespoon of water
> 
> ## **Instructions**
> 
> **For the Crust:**
> 
> 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).
> 2. In a food processor, pulse pecans, flour, sugar, and salt until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cold butter and pulse until mixture looks like wet sand. Add water and pulse until the dough comes together.
> 3. Press dough evenly into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch tart pan. Freeze until firm for about 15 minutes.
> 4. Bake until crust is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let it cool.
> 
> **For the Filling:**
> 
> 5. While the crust is freezing and baking, prepare the filling. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
> 6. Add the apples and pears to the skillet and sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice
> 7. Cook, stirring often, until the apples and pears are just softened and released their juice, about 10 minutes.
> 8. Let the cooked fruit mixture cool slightly, then spread in the baked tart shell.
> 
> **For the Glaze:**
> 
> 9. In a small saucepan, over low heat, melt the apricot jam or honey with water, stirring until it has a glaze-like consistency.
> 10. Brush the glaze over the cooled apple-pear mixture.
> 
> Let the tart cool for a few minutes before serving. You can enhance the flavor with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream on top.
> 
> Enjoy your apple-pear tart with a pecan crust!
**user**:
> Should the pie pan be greased/buttered?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it's a good idea to grease or butter the pie pan before pressing the pecan crust into it. Greasing the pan ensures that the crust doesn't stick to the pan and allows for easy removal of the tart once it's baked. You can use butter, cooking spray, or a light coating of vegetable oil to grease the pan. This will help in achieving a crisp and clean crust for your apple-pear tart.
**user**:
> I am preparing the recipe the night before. Should I combine everything or leave some steps to the end?
**assistant**:
> When preparing the recipe the night before, it's best to leave some steps for the next day to ensure the best texture and taste of the tart. Here's what you can do:
> 
> 1. Prepare the crust: You can make the pecan crust the night before and press it into the pie pan. Freeze the crust until firm as directed in step 3. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap or place it in a sealable plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.
> 
> 2. Cook the filling: On the day you are planning to bake the tart, prepare the filling as directed in steps 5 to 8. Cook the apple and pear mixture in the skillet, cool it slightly, and spread it in the baked and cooled tart shell. You can stop at this step and cover the pan with plastic wrap or place it in a sealable bag to keep it fresh in the refrigerator overnight.
> 
> 3. Glaze and bake: On the day of serving, follow steps 9 and 10 to prepare the glaze and brush it over the tart filling. Then, proceed to bake the tart according to the recipe. This ensures that the crust remains crisp and the glaze stays fresh.
> 
> By leaving the glaze and baking step for the day of serving, you'll ensure that the tart tastes freshly baked and delicious. Just remember to store the prepared components in the refrigerator overnight to maintain their freshness.
