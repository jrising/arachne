> # Investing for Resilience
> 
>  - Investing in coastal resilience, through hard, soft, or hybrid projects, contributes to the preparedness and adaptability of Delaware's coastal economy in the face of changing conditions and potential disruptions.
>  - While hard projects provide immediate protection, they do not adapt well to climate change, need regular maintenance, and may have environmental impacts. Soft projects, while adaptable and providing additional ecological benefits, require more space and time to establish.
>  - Hybrid projects offer potential for blending the strengths of both hard and soft projects, though more understanding and expertise are needed.
>  - The high cost of hard projects, alongside their inability to adapt to climate change, suggests the need for investing in more adaptive, cost-effective strategies like soft and hybrid projects.
>  - The success of these projects and methods relies heavily on established community organizations and effective communication systems. Hence, these systems should be strengthened to support resilience measures.
>  - Exploring the concept of moving further inland, as an additional adaptation method, can provide further options for enhancing coastal resilience.
> 
> ## Monitoring for the Future
> 
>  - Recognizing the dynamism of the coastal economy is essential for strategic resource allocation and for realizing its full economic potential. The development of a "Coastal Barometer" could offer a holistic understanding of this economy's health.
>  - A comprehensive understanding of the diverse risks and opportunities presented by the coastal economy is crucial to manage and leverage them effectively.
>  - The resilience of the economy lies not only in its prosperity but also in its capacity to mitigate risks and seize emerging opportunities. The proposed Coastal Barometer can serve as a tool to track this resilience.
>  - The "Coastal Barometer" can serve as a crucial instrument for sustainable and inclusive development in Delaware, monitoring the coastal economy's health, and guiding its future trajectory.
>  - By using the Barometer, coastal community officials can make better-informed decisions about infrastructure development, land use, and accurately predict the impacts of new developments. This instrument could become a cornerstone for future sustainable development in Delaware.
> 
> ## Research Needs
> 
>  - Future research should focus on the development and implementation of the "Coastal Barometer," which will provide a real-time understanding of the coastal economy's health.
>  - Projecting the impacts of climate change, disaster preparedness, and potential outcomes are areas where more research is needed to enhance the resilience of Delaware's coastal economy.
>  - An in-depth understanding of the cost-effectiveness, protection benefits, and resilience of natural and hybrid systems in the face of larger storms is required to guide strategic investments in coastal resilience.
>  - A comprehensive review of the permitting system and existing barriers, particularly those impacting the use of natural projects for coastal protection, can inform policy adjustments to facilitate these more adaptive, cost-effective resilience measures.
