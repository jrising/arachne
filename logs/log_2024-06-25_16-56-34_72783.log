> I am trying to add a static js file to an Rshiny app. I made a www directory in the working directory of the app on my computer, and put the static js file in there, but when I go to http://127.0.0.1:4640/<my js filename>.js, I get Not Found.
**assistant**:
> To add a static JavaScript file to an RShiny app, you'll need to follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Create the `www` Directory**: Ensure that you have a folder named `www` in your working directory where your shiny app is located. Place your JavaScript file inside this folder.
> 
> 2. **Include the JavaScript File in your UI**: You'll have to reference the JavaScript file in the `ui` section of your app using the `includeScript()` function from the `shiny` package. This function will correctly link to the JavaScript file placed in the `www` directory.
> 
> Hereâ€™s an example of how you can do this:
> 
> ```r
> library(shiny)
> 
> ui <- fluidPage(
>   # Include the JavaScript file placed inside www directory
>   tags$head(includeScript("www/your-file-name.js")),
>   
>   # Your UI elements go here
>   titlePanel("Shiny App with Custom JS"),
>   sidebarLayout(
>     sidebarPanel(
>       # Sidebar elements
>     ),
>     mainPanel(
>       # Main panel elements
>     )
>   )
> )
> 
> server <- function(input, output) {
>   # Server logic goes here
> }
> 
> # Run the application 
> shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
> ```
> 
> Make sure to replace `"www/your-file-name.js"` with the actual path relative to the `www` directory.
> 
> 3. **Test the Shiny App**: Run your shiny app using `runApp()`, and the app should now be able to serve the JavaScript file without any issue.
> 
> Here's an example shell structure of your app:
> 
> ```
> - your-shiny-app/
>   - app.R
>   - www/
>     - your-file-name.js
> ```
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to include and use your JavaScript file in your RShiny app. If this does not solve the issue, please verify that the path name does not have typos and that the file permissions are set correctly to allow reading the JS file.
