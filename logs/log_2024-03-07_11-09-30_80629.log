**user**:
> Is there a library in python that acts like a queue but continually syncs the queue with a file, so that a crash can be recovered from?
**assistant**:
> Python itself doesn't provide a built-in way to persist data in a queue directly to the disk. However, you can use a combination of several libraries to achieve this.
> 
> Python's `queue` module can be used to create an in-memory queue. For storing the data into disk, `pickle` can be useful. `pickle` can serialize Python object structures, which can be written to a file and "un-pickled" back into memory later. Here's a simple implementation:
> 
> ```python
> import queue
> import os
> import pickle
> 
> class PersistentQueue:
>     def __init__(self, filename):
>         self.filename = filename
>         if os.path.exists(self.filename):
>             with open(self.filename, 'rb') as f:
>                 self.queue = pickle.load(f)
>         else:
>             self.queue = queue.Queue()
> 
>     def put(self, item):
>         self.queue.put(item)
>         self._persist()
> 
>     def get(self):
>         item = self.queue.get()
>         self._persist()
>         return item
> 
>     def _persist(self):
>         with open(self.filename, 'wb') as f:
>             pickle.dump(self.queue, f)
> ```
> 
> Each time you perform a put or get operation, the queue is persisted to disk. 
> 
> Remember though, this is a simple example. Depending upon the size and rate of data coming into your queue, continuously writing to disk could be a performance bottleneck. In such cases moving into a database based queuing system (like Redis or RabbitMQ) or distributed task queue like Celery would be a good idea. 
> 
> Also, there are concerns regarding the security and compatibility of `pickle`. You might want to consider using `json` or `msgpack` for serialization, or a task/job queue specifically designed to handle failure such as [RQ](https://python-rq.org/) or [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/). 
> 
> For lightweight needs, [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) might be satisfying enough, acting as a file-based database to store queue data persistently. 
> 
> Always assess and then choose the technology that fits your specific needs.
