> Hi Dr. Rising,
> 
> Hope this email finds you well. This is Md Abedur Rahman. I am reaching out to know if you are taking new graduate students for Fall 2025. I  recently finished my master's in agriculture and resource economics at the University of Delaware in the summer of 2024. I am particularly interested in climate change and its impact on the environment and natural resources research, which coincides with your research area and expertise. 
> 
> I was always impressed by your research work and interested in working with you. Last year I reached out to you and later came to know that the department wouldn't take any students for Fall 2024. So, I didn't apply. 
> 
> This year, I am again considering applying for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program at the University of Delaware. I am hereby sharing with you my academic records and attaching my resume for your reference. Can you kindly suggest if my profile is competitive enough to apply to the Environmental Economics program and if I could be considered if you are looking for a new student?

Given your strong academic background, particularly your previous work on climate change and food waste policy—an area aligned with my own research—I think you would be a good candidate for the program.
> 
> However, please note that funding is limited. I encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year to ensure you are considered for any available funding opportunities. When submitting your application, you might consider mentioning your interest in collaborating on research related to climate change risks and food systems.

> 
> Thank you for your reply! I hope this email finds you well. As I mentioned previously, your research area in climate change and food systems deeply resonates with my academic interests and career goals, and I am highly interested in working under your supervision and guidance.

> As the program requires naming an advisor at the application stage, I would like to inquire if I may have the honor of listing you as my advisor in my Statement of Purpose. This would reflect my genuine interest in working under your guidance and contributing to the ongoing research projects in your group.

> Additionally, I believe a meeting would be beneficial for us to discuss my background, research interests, and how these align with your work. If possible, I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you at your earliest convenience, to further explore how my experiences and aspirations could fit within the program.
