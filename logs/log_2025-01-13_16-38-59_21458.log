> How do I open multiple netcdf files with names of the pattern "daily_edds_YYYY.nc4", with different years YYYY?
**assistant**:
> To open multiple NetCDF files where the filenames follow a pattern such as "daily_edds_YYYY.nc4" with different years, you can use the `glob` module in Python alongside `xarray` to read and concatenate these files. Here is an example of how you might do this:
> 
> ```python
> import xarray as xr
> import glob
> import os
> 
> # Directory containing your NetCDF files
> data_dir = 'path/to/your/data'
> 
> # Use glob to find all files matching the pattern
> file_pattern = os.path.join(data_dir, 'daily_edds_*.nc4')
> file_list = glob.glob(file_pattern)
> 
> # Open multiple NetCDF files using xarray
> ds = xr.open_mfdataset(file_list, combine='by_coords')
> 
> # Now `ds` contains the data combined across all files
> print(ds)
> ```
> 
> ### Key Points:
> 
> - **`glob.glob(file_pattern)`**: This will create a list of all the files that match the pattern "daily_edds_*.nc4" in the given directory.
> - **`xr.open_mfdataset(file_list)`**: This function will open and concatenate all NetCDF files in `file_list`. The `combine='by_coords'` argument tells xarray to align variables based on their coordinates. You can adjust the combination strategy if you have a specific axis along which the files should be concatenated.
>   
> If your files need additional parsing or complex merging strategies, you might need to set additional parameters or preprocessing steps, which you can specify in the `xr.open_mfdataset()` call.

> Do I need to have dask to run open_mfdataset?
**assistant**:
> No, you don't need to have Dask installed to use `xr.open_mfdataset()`, but it's highly recommended for handling large datasets efficiently. Here's the breakdown:
> 
> ### Without Dask:
> - If you don’t have Dask installed, `open_mfdataset()` will load the entire dataset into memory at once. This is manageable for smaller datasets, but can lead to memory issues if the data size exceeds your available RAM.
> 
> ### With Dask:
> - If you have Dask installed, `open_mfdataset()` will use Dask arrays to manage data efficiently, allowing you to work with datasets larger than memory. Dask enables lazy loading of data, which means it only loads the data into memory as needed.
> 
> ### How to Install Dask:
> If you decide to install Dask, you can do so via pip:
> 
> ```bash
> pip install dask
> ```
> 
> ### Summary:
> - **For small datasets**: Dask is optional and you can run `open_mfdataset()` without it.
> - **For larger datasets**: It’s best to have Dask installed for efficient data handling.
> 
> If your dataset is large and you want to take advantage of Dask's capabilities, make sure to install it and explore its features for parallel processing and out-of-core computing.

**assistant**:
> The error message you are seeing indicates that the `dask` module is not installed in your Python environment. Since `open_mfdataset()` is trying to use Dask for processing, it raises a `ModuleNotFoundError`. 
> 
> ### Here’s how to resolve this:
> 
> 1. **Install Dask**:
>    You need to install Dask in your current Conda environment. You can do this via the terminal or command prompt. Make sure to activate the environment first (if using Anaconda):
> 
>    ```bash
>    conda activate aiiter
>    conda install dask
>    ```
> 
>    Or, if you prefer using `pip`:
> 
>    ```bash
>    pip install dask
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Run Your Code Again**:
>    Once Dask is installed, try running your code again:
> 
>    ```python
>    import xarray as xr
>    import glob
>    import os
> 
>    # Directory containing your NetCDF files
>    data_dir = 'path/to/your/data'
> 
>    # Use glob to find all files matching the pattern
>    file_pattern = os.path.join(data_dir, 'daily_edds_*.nc4')
>    file_list = glob.glob(file_pattern)
> 
>    # Open multiple NetCDF files using xarray
>    ds = xr.open_mfdataset(file_list, combine='by_coords')
> 
>    # Now `ds` contains the data combined across all files
>    print(ds)
>    ```
> 
> ### Alternative Without Dask:
> If you prefer **not to use Dask** and still want to work with multiple files, you can use `open_dataset()` in a loop and combine them into a single xarray Dataset:
> 
> ```python
> import xarray as xr
> import glob
> import os
> 
> data_dir = 'path/to/your/data'
> file_pattern = os.path.join(data_dir, 'daily_edds_*.nc4')
> file_list = glob.glob(file_pattern)
> 
> # Open datasets individually and combine them without Dask
> ds = xr.concat([xr.open_dataset(f) for f in file_list], dim='time')  # Adjust the dimension as needed
> 
> print(ds)
> ```
> 
> In this approach, you're opening each dataset individually and then concatenating them. This method can be more straightforward but may not perform as well as the Dask-based approach for larger datasets.
