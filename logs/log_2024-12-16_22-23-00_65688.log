**assistant**:
> Representational justice and procedural justice are both important concepts within the broader framework of social justice, but they focus on different aspects of fairness and equity.
> 
> **Representational Justice** refers to the equitable inclusion and representation of diverse groups, particularly marginalized or underrepresented communities, in decision-making processes and institutions. It emphasizes ensuring that diverse voices are heard and that these voices have a meaningful impact on the outcomes. This type of justice is crucial for addressing imbalances in power and influence and is often manifested in efforts to diversify leadership, committees, and organizations.
> 
> **Procedural Justice**, on the other hand, concerns the fairness and transparency of the processes that lead to outcomes. It focuses on ensuring that rules and procedures are applied consistently and fairly, that individuals have a voice in the process, and that decision-making is unbiased and impartial. Procedural justice is fundamental for fostering trust in institutions and the perceived legitimacy of outcomes, as it reassures stakeholders that decisions are made fairly.
> 
> In summary, while representational justice emphasizes who is included and has influence in decision-making, procedural justice focuses on how decisions are made and whether the process is fair and transparent. Both are essential for achieving comprehensive social justice but address different dimensions of equity and fairness.
