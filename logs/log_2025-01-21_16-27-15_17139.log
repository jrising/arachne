**assistant**:
> A term that could encompass fish suitability, their egg/larval development, and the thermal bottlenecks they are constrained by is "**thermal habitat suitability**." This term reflects the importance of temperature conditions in determining the viability of fish populations, as it affects their growth, development, and survival, particularly during the sensitive egg and larval stages. It also highlights the constraints imposed by thermal limits, which are critical in understanding the impact of changing environmental conditions on marine ecosystems.
