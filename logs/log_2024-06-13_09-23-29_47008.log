> I have a problem with an R script that is stalling. Can you write for me a bash script that solves this in the following way:
> 
> First, it runs the script 4 times, using `Rscript master.R &`. This will set up four persistent processes. On start-up, each process will write a file in a `processes/` directory, with its PID, and it will update that file on a regular basis unless it stalls.
> 
> Then, the bash script should wait, and once per hour do the following: Check each file in the `processes` directory. If it has been more than 3 hours since any of these files has been written to, that PID should be killed (-9), and a new process should be started back up in its place.
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Below is a bash script that meets your requirements. It initiates four `Rscript` processes, keeps track of their PIDs, and monitors them on an hourly basis, restarting any process that stalls for more than three hours.

> ### Key Points in the Script:
> 
> 1. **Initialization**: The script creates a `processes/` directory if it doesn't exist.
> 2. **Process Start**: The `start_process` function starts an R process and writes its PID.
> 3. **Hourly Monitoring**: The script sleeps for an hour (`sleep 3600`), then checks each PID file.
> 4. **Stall Detection**: If a PID has not updated its file for more than 3 hours (`10800` seconds), it kills the process and starts a new one.
> 5. **Process Check**: It ensures processes are still running using `kill -0`, and if not, it removes their PID files and starts replacements.
> 
> These steps should ensure that no `Rscript` process stalls for more than 3 hours without being restarted. This script is to be run in the background or as a service to monitor and manage the R processes.
