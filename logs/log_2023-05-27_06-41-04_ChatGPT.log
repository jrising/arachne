> Marian Parrott owned a restaurant called Sedona for 30 years. It was located on 26 N Pennsylvania Ave in Bethany Beach, DE. She sold the business last month. Sedona was located near the loop canal and would be impacted by coastal flooding in addition to flooding from the canal. In some cases there would be both coastal and canal flooding that would meet and cause higher waters. The flooding sometimes covered an area of about a mile to a mile and a half along Pennsylvania Ave to Maine Street and the Highway. Sedona was set about three feet off the ground on concrete blocks so the interior never flooded, but the surrounding area would. This cost Marian revenue and product as customers were unable to get to the restaurant. Food products that were purchased for a weekend would spoil because no one was able to make it to Sedona to purchase food. Flooding affected Marian and her business 6 to 8 times per year. 
> Flooding over the years has gotten worse due to climate change and possibly due to construction. Houses in the area are getting larger and larger with more impervious concrete surfaces. 
> Marian estimated her average daily income around $3,000 per day. When the streets flooded she lost not only her daily revenue but an estimated $500 to $1500 worth of food product purchased for use in the restaurant. One Columbus Day weekend a few years ago, the town was impacted by King Tide flooding, which caused the electricity to go out. Marian lost around $10,000 in revenue and $5,000 worth of product that spoiled without electricity to keep fridges and freezers running. Her insurance for the business did not cover the loss, so it was on her as the owner to deal with the loss. Other businesses and residents have similar issues with flooding and insurance companies refusing to cover the damages. Marian stated that flood insurance is impossible to get and FEMA doesn’t have the funds to help. 
> Marian believes that mitigation is possible, but that flooding is inevitable because working against mother nature and climate change is impossible. The low-lying nature of where Sedona was located especially made flooding inevitable. The town has thought about some mitigation projects, but did not pursue many. There was a culvert repair project a few years ago that repaired old, broken, concrete culverts in the area that weren’t allowing water to drain. These culverts require a lot of maintenance to help mitigate flooding and allow water to drain from the area. Coastal communities around the US need to assess mitigation strategies and how to repair damage because they will continue to be impacted by flooding and climate change. 
> 	Marian mentioned the term nuisance flooding, which she stated was a misnomer and felt that it belittled the problem of flooding and what she and others in the area were having to deal with regularly. 
> 	Marian stated that she thought the idea of using a bladder around the loop canal had potential. It would be an inflatable bladder used only when needed to contain water from the canal. Marian also stated that it was potentially expensive from an engineering standpoint and perhaps that was why it hadn’t been done. She disagreed with constant beach replenishment projects because the ocean always takes the sand back after it has been replaced.

> The division was created about 2 years ago after increasing frequency and severity of flooding. Previously there were a couple people working on resiliency issues in addition to their other jobs within DelDOT. The Cabinet Secretary for the State recognized a need to have a full time team working on the problem as the impacts were getting worse and wanted to take advantage of the availability of federal funding. The division is now Jim (Director) and an Assistant Director and a number of consultants.
> Currently the division is working on a planning project to address flooding issues with Route 1 (SR1). They received a grant through FEMA to do a resiliency planning study for a 16 miles stretch of SR1 between Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island to determine what the best option was moving forward. SR1 sees a lot of flooding and so far DelDOT has been able to keep it open to at least emergency vehicles during flooding events, but that may not be the case in the future. Alternative evacuation routes add an additional hour to the trip which is not feasible in an emergency situation. The project is currently in the public meeting phase. They have had two public meetings and there has been unanimous agreement that something needs to be done for SR1 and the other roads used as evacuation routes. In addition to public meetings DelDOT is meeting with each of the towns (mayors, town manager, police, etc) to ensure that their opinions are heard. There will also be a public survey to collect information on what segment of the 16 mile stretch is the most important and should be prioritized first. The idealized end of the project is something that best incorporates the needs of DelDOT (the transportation needs of the state) in addition to the needs of the communities. The solution needs to be “context sensitive”. One proposed solution was flood walls, but the communities were against that idea because it hurts the aesthetics of the area. 
> Within the state, flooding is the biggest impact from climate change. Delaware is the lowest lying state in the country and has to deal with tidal/sunny day flooding in addition to short term/ high intensity storm events. There are communities in Kent County that only have one road in or out that floods daily. DelDOT has raised some of those roads as well as ones in Sussex County that flood consistently but that is not a long term solution and will not completely solve the problem. There is some concern about extreme heat on people and pavement, but that is considered minor and has not affected anything like flooding has. 
> Sussex County and the beaches are a major concern considering the number of tourists that frequent the area. Tourists will follow the evacuation routes and will be less likely to know the roads to go around if an evacuation route is also flooded. The alternate routes to SR1 (Routes 24 and 20) also flood. Having to deal with an increased number of people who aren’t familiar with the area is a concern for DelDOT during an emergency flooding event. Other concerns during a flooding event include access for emergency services and the ability of fire trucks or ambulances to get into and out of the area to help people. 
> The potential barriers for the project are community involvement, coordination of utilities, the possibility of needing to purchase private property to adjust the right of way, and the permitting process through DENRC or the Army Corps. Designing the plan on paper is the easy part. DelDOT has to coordinate with all of the utility companies in the area to ensure they don’t disrupt service and this can take time to figure out. Permitting is also difficult and can take a lot of time before any project can begin. Getting the right of way by purchasing private property or by condemning a property is also time-consuming and can be held up by lawsuits.

> ### Interview with Marian Parrott - Former Owner, Sedona Restaurant, Bethany Beach
> 
> Marian Parrott, who owned and operated Sedona Restaurant for 30 years in Bethany Beach, Delaware, gave us an inside look at the tangible financial impact of climate change on local businesses. Positioned on 26 N Pennsylvania Ave, her restaurant faced frequent coastal and canal flooding, which worsened over the years due to climate change and construction developments in the area.
> 
> The flooding caused significant disruption to business operations 6 to 8 times per year, as customers couldn't reach the restaurant and food products spoiled. Sedona's daily income was roughly $3,000, and the losses from flooding were even more significant - often costing the restaurant its daily revenue plus $500 to $1500 worth of food. One particularly severe King Tide event resulted in losses totaling $15,000.
> 
> Parrott's struggles highlight the financial costs businesses on Delaware's coasts face due to increasing climate-induced flooding. Despite the gravity of these problems, Parrott shared that flood insurance is difficult to obtain, and FEMA lacks sufficient funds to aid in these circumstances. She believes that while mitigation measures are possible, it is impossible to eliminate flooding entirely due to the inherent challenges of combating mother nature and climate change.
> 
> ### Interview with Jim Pappas - DelDOT Director of Transportation, Resiliency and Sustainability
> 
> In contrast, Jim Pappas, DelDOT Director of Transportation and Resiliency and Sustainability, offered a view from the perspective of the state government, focusing on the infrastructural and transport challenges posed by flooding. His Division was established two years ago to address the increasing frequency and severity of flooding.
> 
> One of the major projects they're focusing on is the planning and mitigation of flooding issues with Route 1 (SR1), which stretches from Dewey Beach to Fenwick Island and is frequently impacted by flooding. Ensuring the route remains open during emergencies is critical, as alternative evacuation routes significantly lengthen travel times. The division is actively engaging with the public and other town officials to ensure the final plan addresses both transportation needs and community requirements.
> 
> Pappas highlighted that flooding is the most significant climate change impact within the state, given that Delaware is the lowest lying state in the country. They have taken measures such as road elevation to mitigate flooding, but acknowledge that these aren't long-term solutions. Flooding also affects evacuation routes and emergency services' accessibility, both of which are critical in emergency situations.
> 
> The interviews with Parrott and Pappas reveal the vast economic and infrastructural challenges faced by Delaware's coasts due to climate change. These conversations underscore the need for effective mitigation strategies and cooperation between businesses, communities, and government bodies to adapt to this evolving landscape.
