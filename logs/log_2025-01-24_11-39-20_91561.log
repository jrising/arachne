Since you have given your consent to serve as a potential advisor, I will also discuss it with the Program Director, Professor Moffat. Professor, secondly what about the courses that I have taken in the Biden School? Most of them are PhD level courses, can they (or some of them) be counted towards the EE PhD Program? Lastly, if approved, do I shift immediately or in Fall 2025?

He has shown some conditional willingness but since the date for funding has lapsed, the funding will be a potential issue. Is it possible that my current funding which I am getting as a PhD student from the Biden School is transferred to the Environmental Economics Program (for one year or sometime, they can figure out funding)? Alternatively, what else can be the way out, can graduate college provide some funding?

That suggests to me that you need to get agreement from the Biden School that your funding can be transferred over. Once you get that, we can collect the rest of the information we need.

I shall be extremely grateful for your assistance as I really intend to transfer and in case, I am unable to transfer this year, too much time will be lost for me to shift to a different program as I am already in the second year of a PhD program. Therefore, I shall be extremely grateful for your assistance.

> Further, when I applied at the Biden School, I also missed the December 15 deadline and instead applied before the January 15th deadline and was offered admission around Spring break in the second round. The point I am trying to make is that sometimes, some or any of the students do not accept admission, which can create room for those on the waiting list. Can there be any such case for me or otherwise any sort of funding in the form of TA, RA, or GA may be able to help me? Kindly guide me as I intend to transfer without losing much time. In the meantime, I am checking from the Biden School whether they would allow for the funding to be transferred with the contract.

> 1. **Potential Advisor:** You already have me as a potential advisor, which is a positive step for your transition.
> 
> 2. **Secure Funding Agreement:** Your immediate priority is to obtain agreement from the Biden School to transfer your current funding if you are accepted into the EE program. This is crucial, as funding typically does not automatically follow students when switching programs.

> 3. **Apply to the EE Program:** After securing the agreement, proceed with your application to the EE PhD program.

> 4. **Acceptance and Full Application Review:** If you can secure the funding agreement from the Biden School, your application to the EE program is expected to be accepted. However, we would need to review your full application to finalize this decision.

> 5. **Finalize Funding Transfer:** Upon acceptance, we will work together to finalize the transfer of funds from the Biden School to the School of Marine Science & Policy (SMSP).
