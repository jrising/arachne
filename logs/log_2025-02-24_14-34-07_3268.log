> Do any species of Elasmobranchii engage in "homing" behavior (returning to their site of spawning)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, some species within Elasmobranchii, which includes sharks, rays, and skates, are known to exhibit homing behavior. Notably, certain species of sharks engage in this behavior. For example, the lemon shark (*Negaprion brevirostris*) has been observed returning to its native nursery areas to reproduce. This homing behavior is thought to be crucial for maintaining population structures and ensuring successful reproduction. Such behavior suggests a remarkable ability to navigate and find precise locations over large distances in the ocean, likely using a combination of environmental cues like magnetic fields, water chemistry, and even acoustic signals.
