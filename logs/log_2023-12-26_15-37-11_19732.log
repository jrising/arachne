**assistant**:
> If you have a set of Monte Carlo draws from a continuous distribution, you can approximate the entropy of the distribution using estimators. Here is a potential approach:

> The K-nearest neighbor estimator is a popular non-parametric entropy estimation method. Essentially, it calculates the entropy directly from the data without the need to estimate the underlying probability distribution. 
> 
> The following steps are in Julia:
> 
> 1. Install the `NearestNeighbors.jl` and `Distances.jl` packages for implementing the K-nearest neighbor method.
> 
> ```julia
> using Pkg
> Pkg.add("NearestNeighbors")
> Pkg.add("Distances")
> using NearestNeighbors, Distances
> ```
> 
> 2. Using the Monte Carlo sampled data, construct a nearest neighbor structure called a "ball tree." The neighbors must be computed in terms of their ranks rather than their absolute distances.

> ```julia
> tree = KDTree(data, Euclidean())

> 
> 3. Find the k-nearest neighbor distance `d_k` for every data point.

> ```julia
> k = # choose a value for k
> d_k = # store the distances here
> 
> for i in eachindex(data[:, 1])
>     idxs, dists = knn(tree, data[:, i], k + 1)  # k + 1 because it will also return the point itself
>     d_k[i] = dists[end]  # last distance is the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor
> end  
> ```
> 
> 4. Calculate the entropy approximation from the following formula:
> 
> ```julia
> N = length(data[:, 1])
> k = # choose a value for k
> entropy = (log(N) - psi(k) + log(sum(d_k)) + log(2)) / N + log(pi)

> This method is derived from Kozachenko and Leonenko (1987): "Sample Estimate of the Entropy of a Random Vector."

> Note: The choice of k is not obvious. There are ways to choose k optimally in theory, but these may require more samples than you have in practice. Therefore, some trial and error might be necessary to find a suitable k for your specific data.
