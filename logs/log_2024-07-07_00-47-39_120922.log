**assistant**:
> In grant terminology, "programmatic decision making" refers to the process through which funding foundations or organizations decide which projects, initiatives or programs they will support, based on their strategic goals, mission, and target impacts. This includes considerations like the potential return on investment, alignment with the organization's broader objectives, feasibility of the programs, anticipated community impact, and more.
> 
> The decision-making process usually involves a thorough review of grant applications, which are proposals sent by individuals or groups seeking funding. This can include score-based evaluations of each proposal, discussions in decision-making committees, and further interaction with applicants for clarifications or additional information. Intended to be a structured and objective method, programmatic decision making aims to ensure the effective use of organizational resources in achieving their goals. 
> 
> The term can also involve evaluating ongoing programs the organization is funding. This includes monitoring progress, assessing outcomes compared to expectations, and considering whether the program should continue to be funded or be adjusted to better meet goals.
