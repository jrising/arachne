**user**:
> I am collaborating with a group led by a man named Thet Hein Tun. I have spoken to him multiple times on zoom, but I don't remember how people refer to him. I see a public webpage that refers to him as Hein, but I think I should be addressing him more familiarly. Do I use Thet?
**assistant**:
> Given the personal name "Thet Hein Tun", in the context of Burmese naming conventions, it's important to know that they do not employ the typical Western "first name, last name" structure. Instead, a person's full name is often a combination of individual, meaningful words. There are no traditional family names.
> 
> In a formal or professional context, it's usually safe to use the person's full name. In a familiar setting, you might use the first part of their name, which in this case would be "Thet". However, based on the public webpage referring to him as "Hein", you might consider clarifying with him next time you speak.
