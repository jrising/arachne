> I am building a smart form to help direct prospective applicants to our environmental policy programs at UD. Below is the information about the options, written as a request to write a response to them. The new plan is to provide a standard response that directs them to this form.
> ===I would like you to write a response to the following email, from me, which I believe is a request for me to supervise a student within one of the following academic programs (and it may not be clear): - Masters in Marine Policy: Explain that this program has now transitioned to the exciting new Environmental Science & Management program (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/) which has a Marine track. - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds. - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters) - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for prospective students. - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science & Policy school: In this case, suggest that the applicant reach out to Xinfeng Liang <xfliang@udel.edu>. As a first step, identify any specific questions asked in the email or core confusions and relay them back here. I will provide any answers if needed to incorporate in the response. If the person is local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, or if they did schoolwork at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, tell me. Please identify which of these programs the person is interested in, or if it is ambiguous, offer a few sentences to help them decide. Do not mention the other programs. For the Ph.D. programs, note that funding is limited. If they seem like they would well-qualified to do work related to my research (climate change risks, food systems, interdisciplinary quantitative modeling), encourage them to mention me in their statement of purpose. For the EE Masters program, note that it is a self-funded program. For the ESM program, note that there is limited funding available (the program is unfunded for most students). Here is a template email, which you can use or modify. In any case, keep the email similarly brief. Do not be overly enthusiastic or suggest that they are uniquely qualified for a spot. Dear [NAME], Thank you for reaching out. It sounds like you would be good candidate for [PROGRAM]. However, funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year [OR DECEMBER 15 FOR ESM] so that you can be considered for any available funds. Best, James Rising School of Marine Science & Policy, UDel === I would like you to develop the form questions for this, using multiple choice and I will be implementing this with Google Form's conditional direction to different sections based on the responses. The form should provide explanation as it goes, and ultimately end with information about a particular program and an automatic email sent to one of us to evaluate the outcome. It should also be fairly short, to minimize the busy work for good candidates, while also ensuring that most people (who do not end up being good candidates, because of lack of funding or quantitative skills mostly) realize this. Here are some notes on specific pathways that should be explored for the students: - Are they interested in a social science or natural science degree? - If social science, are they a better fit for marine policy (MP) (more qualitative, less defined) or environmental economics (EE) (quantitative)? - If EE, we want to know if they have the necessary quantitative background. For this, we need them to upload the transcripts and specify if they have had microeconomics, calculus, statistics, and/or programming. - For ESM students, EE Masters, and MP Masters students, they need to be self-funding. - For people interested in pursing PhD programs, we want to check if they satisfy the qualifications for the GSA award (I'll have the text, mainly whether they are a minority; this must be self-reported). - For the final page for MP and EE PhD, there will be a list of research interests where they are requested to identify the closest (and each of those will auto-send to a different faculty member). Also on that page, we could collect other information on their research interests. - Anything else that seems necessary to communicate or evaluate, given the text above.

> Creating an effective smart form will streamline your process for guiding prospective applicants to the right program. Here's a suggested structure for the Google Form with questions to direct candidates accurately:
> 
> ### Google Form Structure
> 
> #### Introduction
> - **Welcome Message:** Thank applicants for their interest in the School of Marine Science & Policy programs. Encourage them to provide accurate responses to help determine the best fit program.
> 
> #### Section 1: Academic Interests
> 1. **Question:** What is your primary area of interest?
>    - Social Science
>    - Natural Science
> 
>    - **Logic:** 
>      - If "Social Science" is selected, go to Section 2A.
>      - If "Natural Science" is selected, direct them to contact Xinfeng Liang at <xfliang@udel.edu> and possibly submit basic contact info for follow-up.
> 
> #### Section 2A: Social Science Pathway
> 2. **Question:** Which program are you most interested in?
>    - Marine Policy (MP)
>    - Environmental Economics (EE)
>    - Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
> 
> 3. **Logic:** 
>    - If "Marine Policy," go to Section 3A.
>    - If "Environmental Economics," go to Section 3B.
>    - If "Environmental Science & Management," go to Section 3C.
> 
> #### Section 3A: Marine Policy (MP)
> 4. **Question:** Are you applying for a Masters or Ph.D. program?
>    - Masters
>    - Ph.D.
> 
> 5. **Message:** Note that the Masters in Marine Policy has transitioned to the Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track. Mention the self-funded requirement for Masters and limited funding for Ph.D. Encourage applying by December 15 for consideration of available funds.
> 
> #### Section 3B: Environmental Economics (EE)
> 6. **Question:** Do you have a strong quantitative background? (e.g., courses in microeconomics, calculus, statistics, programming)
>    - Yes
>    - No
> 
> 7. **Request:** Please upload your relevant transcripts.
>    
> 8. **Question:** Are you applying for a Masters or Ph.D. program?
>    - Masters
>    - Ph.D.
> 
> 9. **Message:** 
>    - Masters is self-funded.
>    - Ph.D. funding is limited. If qualified, consider mentioning James Rising in your statement of purpose.
> 
> #### Section 3C: Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
> 10. **Message:** This program has limited funding available and is unfunded for most students. Please apply by December 15 for funding consideration.
> 
> #### Section 4: Ph.D. Considerations
> 11. **Question:** Do you qualify for the GSA award? (minority status self-reporting)
>    - Yes
>    - No
> 
> #### Section 5: Research Interests (For MP and EE Ph.D.)
> 12. **Question:** Please identify your closest research interest(s):
>     - Climate Change Risks
>     - Food Systems
>     - Interdisciplinary Quantitative Modeling
>     - Other [Text Box]
> 
> 13. **Request:** Please describe any other research interests you have in 200 words or less.
> 
> #### Final Section: Contact Information and Submission
> 14. **Question:** Is there anything else you would like us to know?
> 
> 15. **Contact Request:** Please enter your email to receive a response and further information.
> 
> 16. **Thank You Message:** Thank the applicant for their time and advise that their responses will be reviewed, and they'll receive guidance on the next steps shortly.
> 
> ### Implementation Tips:
> - Use multiple-choice questions to guide applicants efficiently through the form, minimizing open-ended questions to streamline processing.
> - Ensure branching logic directs applicants to the most relevant sections or to appropriate contact points.
> - Track responses specific to research interests to automatically forward submissions to the related faculty members.
> 
> This structure should make the application process user-friendly and ensure potential applicants receive relevant, targeted information quickly. Let me know if there are specific elements you'd like to refine further!
