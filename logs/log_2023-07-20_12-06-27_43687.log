> I would like to discuss with you the opportunity to work under your supervision in the area of " Climate change adaptation, Climate change mitigation, sustainable development, Economic growth, and the complementarity between these concepts; I will be particularly interested in understanding how country-level adaptation strategies are affecting economic growth, most especially the agriculture sector which is one of the most vulnerable sectors. However, I am open to suggestions and modifications to refine my ideas.

> Dear Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program at University of Delaware (UDel). 
> 
> Your background in sustainable development and entrepreneurship aligns well with my research on climate change and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. Your research focus on climate change adaptation, mitigation, and its effects on economic growth, especially in relation to the agriculture sector, is not only meaningful but also fascinating.
> 
> The work you've accomplished, including the papers you've presented and had accepted at conferences, suggest you would indeed be a strong candidate for our Environmental Economics program. Additionally, your thesis topic on the impacts of ESG reporting on corporate performance strongly aligns with the program's interest.
> 
> However, it's worth noting that funding is always a constraint in our ability to offer spots to students. While we do have limited funding available, I would encourage you to apply in plenty of time (by the end of the calendar year) so that you can be considered for any available funds.
> 
> As you plan for your application, feel free to reach out if you have further questions or require additional guidance. I hope that we can work together to make an impact in this crucial area of study.
