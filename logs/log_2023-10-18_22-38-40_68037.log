> I am making a hierarchical clustering of vectors (the vectors are of length 653), where the my distance matrix is 1 - correlation(A, B) for any two vectors A and B. The goal is to ensure that vectors are only statistically significantly correlated within each cluster. The height of my hierarchical clustering is the maximum distance between vectors within pairs of clusters. What height should I cut my tree at to ensure that that the resulting clusters are not statistically significantly correlated?
**assistant**:
> The height at which to cut your hierarchical tree is a complex question, and it depends on the specifics of your data and what you consider to be a statistically significant correlation.
> 
> One approach would be using hypothesis testing for correlation. In this case, the null hypothesis would typically be "there is no correlation between the two clusters."
> 
> Let's assume you have a significance level (α) of 0.05. For each pair of clusters, this will correspond to a minimum correlation value below which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In the context of your distance measure (1 - correlation), this will correspond to a maximum distance.
> 
> One common way to test correlation is to use the Pearson correlation. The statistical significance of a Pearson correlation Co, obtained from n samples, can be derived from Student's t-distribution:
> 
> `T = Co * sqrt((n-2) / (1 - Co^2))`
> 
> This T-value can be looked up in a table of the t-distribution (or calculated using a function from a statistical package like scipy.stats in Python) to get a p-value. If the p-value is below α, then the correlation is statistically significant.
> 
> So, to obtain the maximum allowed distance for a correlation to still be statistically significant:
> 
> 1. Transform α to a Co value using an inverse t-distribution function, getting Co (set degrees of freedom to n-2).
> 2. Calculate the distance as 1 - Co.
> 3. Use this distance as the height to cut your hierarchical tree.
> 
> You might need to adjust this method depending on your exact needs and your definition of a "cluster." Also, remember that this assumes that your data is distributed in a way that the Pearson correlation and t-distribution make sense.
> 
> Additionally, keep in mind that hierarchical clustering is prone to the problem of "chaining," where a cluster can span a large distance because of a chain of close intermediaries. Therefore, some clusters resulting after the cut might still have members with a substantial distance. 
> 
> Lastly, due to the multiple comparisons problem, you might want to adjust your α (using, for instance, the Bonferroni correction) to avoid spurious results.

**assistant**:
> In R, you can use the `hclust` function to perform hierarchical clustering and determine the height at which to cut the tree. Here's a step-by-step guide:
> 
> 1. Compute your distance matrix. Let's assume you have a matrix called `data` with your vectors.
> 
> ```R
> distance_matrix <- as.dist(1 - cor(data))
> ```
> 
> 2. Perform hierarchical clustering using the `hclust` function.
> 
> ```R
> hclust_result <- hclust(distance_matrix, method = "complete")  # You can choose a different linkage method if desired
> ```
> 
> 3. Plot the dendrogram to get a visual representation of the hierarchical clustering.
> 
> ```R
> plot(hclust_result)
> ```
> 
> 4. Determine the height at which to cut the tree based on your desired criteria. In this case, you want to cut the tree to ensure statistically insignificant correlation within each cluster.
> 
> ```R
> # Example for cutting the tree at a specific height
> height_threshold <- 0.5  # Replace with your desired threshold
> cut_tree <- cutree(hclust_result, h = height_threshold)
> ```
> 
> You can modify the `height_threshold` value to match your desired level.
> 
> Alternatively, if you want to determine the height automatically based on statistical significance, you can use the `cor.mtest` function from the `psych` package to calculate p-values for pairwise correlations within each cluster. Then, you can adjust the height threshold based on your desired significance level. Here's an example:
> 
> ```R
> # Example using cor.mtest for automatic determination of height threshold
> library(psych)
> 
> # Compute p-values for pairwise correlations within each cluster
> cluster_assignments <- cut_tree(hclust_result, h = height_threshold)  # Replace height_threshold with your desired threshold
> p_values <- apply(data, 2, function(x) {
>   subset_data <- cbind(x, cluster_assignments)
>   cluster_p_values <- t(sapply(unique(cluster_assignments), function(cluster_num) {
>     cluster_subset <- subset_data[cluster_assignments == cluster_num, ]
>     cors <- cor.mtest(cluster_subset[, 1], cluster_subset[, 2])$p
>     cors[cors != ""]  # Remove empty results
>   }))
>   cluster_p_values

> 
> # Adjust height threshold based on desired significance level (e.g., Bonferroni correction)
> adjusted_height_threshold <- height_threshold / length(p_values)  # Adjust based on the
**user**:
> I want to use your math above-- a Student’s t-distribution. You said, "Transform α to a Co value using an inverse t-distribution function, getting Co (set degrees of freedom to n-2)." How do I do this in R?
**assistant**:
> In R, you can use the `qt` function to calculate the critical t-value corresponding to a given significance level (α) and degrees of freedom (df). Here's how you can find the correlation coefficient (Co) corresponding to a given significance level using the t-distribution:
> 
> ```R
> # Example code for finding the correlation coefficient using the t-distribution
> 
> alpha <- 0.05  # Set the desired significance level
> df <- n - 2    # Compute the degrees of freedom (n: number of samples)
> 
> critical_t_value <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df)  # Calculate the critical t-value (two-tailed test)
> coefficient_of_correlation <- critical_t_value / sqrt(df + critical_t_value^2)  # Compute the correlation coefficient
> 
> coefficient_of_correlation
> ```
> 
> In the above code, the `qt` function calculates the critical t-value corresponding to the upper tail of the t-distribution. Since the t-distribution is symmetric, we use `1 - alpha/2` to get the critical value for a two-tailed test. We then compute the correlation coefficient (Co) by dividing the critical t-value by the square root of (df + t_value^2), where df is the number of degrees of freedom (n - 2) in your case.
> 
> Please note that `n` in the code represents the number of samples used to calculate the correlation coefficient. Make sure to adjust it accordingly in your specific scenario.
