**assistant**:
> Sure, James. Here are some suggested criteria for deciding which individuals from your professional network should receive a holiday card. It's always a nice gesture to reconnect and express appreciation:
> 
> 1. **Ongoing Professional Relationships:** These include clients, partners, collaborators, mentors, and mentees with whom you've interacted frequently over the past year. Regular contact is key to maintaining these important relationships.
> 
> 2. **Significant Impact:** Send cards to those who have significantly influenced your work during the past year. This impact could be through providing important insights, collaborating on significant projects, or serving as inspirational sources in your field. 
> 
> 3. **Recent Acquaintances:** Consider sending cards to individuals you've recently met at conferences, seminars, or networking events. This can help solidify your connection and keep you top-of-mind for future opportunities.
> 
> 4. **Key Stakeholders:** Depending on your work, this could include influential individuals, leaders within your field, or people whose work aligns closely with your own. Sending them a card could spark a beneficial conversation or collaboration.
> 
> 5. **Past Mentors or Significant Colleagues:** Even if you haven't been in active communication, the holiday season provides a great opportunity to reach out and express your ongoing appreciation for their past help and guidance.
> 
> 6. **Team Members:** Don’t forget to include current and previous team members. It’s a great way to express appreciation for their efforts and maintain strong professional relationships.
> 
> Remember that the goal of a holiday card is to maintain and strengthen your professional connections and express your gratitude and good wishes, so ensure your message reflects this. Personalizing your message, where possible, can also give it a more considerate and genuine touch.
