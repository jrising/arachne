> To sustain and equitably accommodate future population growth, efforts are channeled towards making both existing and new buildings more sustainable. Existing buildings will be made more energy and water efficient, while promoting health and livability. Success with these efforts will be measured by DOEE and BEPS goals, the number of buildings reached, and compliance rate with BEPS.
