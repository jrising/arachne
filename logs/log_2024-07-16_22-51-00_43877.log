So again, it's it's nothing new to our history, but we are seeing more events, and we are seeing more what I would call, you know, sunny day events.

> ### Interview Questions
> 
> Interviewee: So, we are a coastal community. We've got a rather long history of dealing with the curveballs that Mother Nature sends to us. Coastal flooding in and of itself is not new. It is something that, you know, when we choose to live here, we choose to deal with those complications that arise. What we have seen is that there is an increase in the number of events. We have seen also that there is an increase in the number of what we would call sunny day events. So more tidal components to them. Obviously any kind of storm that comes off of our coast—Nor’easters, hurricanes, tropical storms—these are all events that we are very attuned to and react to.

> Interviewee: We haven't had the degree of flooding that we had in a major event like Hurricane Sandy. You know, I think the big event that all of us still, if we don't remember it, we certainly can communicate about it, which is the storm of 1962. That really did a lot of damage flooding. Those events have been occurring for a long time. Our town itself, when you go back into the history, you can see that it built and rebuilt several times along the shore. And with each storm that would come in and kind of wash away the villages or the little cottages, they would come back and redo it again. So again, it's nothing new to our history, but we are seeing more events, and we are seeing more what I would call sunny day events.

> CW: Where do you see those impacts happening?
> Interviewee: So, the impacts that we see are primarily on the bayside community. Probably 80% of our town is on the bayside, west of Route 1. We were a town that kind of was built out of marshland way back in the day. We had two groups that came in and sort of developed our bayside community. One was Colonel Schultz. He was part of the National Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers. So we have a very straight series of canals and lagoons that he kind of built to create Fenwick Island. He used the fill from the lagoons to make building lots. The other part of our town, which was on the south side, was done by Madison Gray. His canals can be a little bit more meandering, so that that can give rise to some issues with algae build-up and not as good flushing. But both of them sort of used the same matrix.

> Interviewee: So our bayside community is either on the water, or close to it, and is subject to both tidal surges, as well as heavy rain. Our rainwater management system drains to the bay, so when the bay is high and we get a lot of rain, that makes the problem that much more compounded.
