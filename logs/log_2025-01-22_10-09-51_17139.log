> Hi Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope this email finds you well.
> 
> My name is Damodar Gautam, and I am originally from Nepal but currently residing in Champaign, Illinois. I am reaching out to inquire about potential PhD opportunities within your lab or research group.
> 
> I hold an MS degree in Agr-Economics and Agribusiness Management from Agriculture and Forestry University in Nepal, where my research focused on technology adoption, willingness to pay analysis, natural resource economics, and data driven decision support system. Since 2018, I have been working as a Research Officer at the Nepal Agricultural Research Council. Currently, I am on sabbatical and living in the United States with my wife, she is a Postdoc at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.
> 
> I have reviewed your recent publications on climate change impact assessment, social cost of carbon dioxide, and other emerging environmental issues, with a particular focus on climate change. Your work on integrating big data and machine learning tools for empirical estimation and modeling of socio-environmental systems aligns closely with my research interests and expertise. I found your articles "Climate damage projections beyond annual temperature" and "A practical guide to climate econometrics: Navigating key decision points in weather and climate data analysis" to be particularly insightful and innovative in their approach.
> 
> I am particularly interested in integrating the recent machine learning tools to assess the impact of global change especially rising temperature and drought on the crop production. At this moment, I am reviewing the ML based modeling approaches used in environmental events predictions.
> 
> I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills may contribute to your research goals. 
> 
> I have attached my curriculum vitae for your review.
> 
> Thank you for considering my inquiry. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this further.

> Dear Damodar,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in my work. It sounds like you could be a good candidate for our Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program. However, please note that funding opportunities are always a constraint. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funding, and you might find it beneficial to mention me in your statement of purpose.

> Thank you for your response.

> I am currently preparing my application materials for the Fall 2025 term. I recently completed the GRE, achieving a score of 157 in the Quantitative section. However, I am uncertain whether this score will be competitive for the environmental economics program. Additionally, I have scheduled my TOEFL for the last week of October. Hopefully, I will submit my complete application to the graduate school by the end of November.
> 
> As I work on identifying a research gap in the field of climate change modeling, I will be drafting my Statement of Purpose. Definitely, I will  mention your work in my SoP.
> 
> I will keep you updated on my progress.

> Dear Damodar,
> 
> Thank you for your continued interest in joining our research group. I hope this message finds you well.
> 
> Unfortunately, I must inform you that due to unforeseen changes in university policy, we are unable to offer funding for incoming Ph.D. candidates this year. I understand this might impact your decision, as I noted your application without funding is also under consideration, but I must convey that this is not recommended.
> 
> One alternative could be to consider enrolling in our Master's program in Environmental Economics. While this would require you to secure your own funding initially, there may be opportunities to acquire financial support as you progress through the program.
> 
> Should you wish to discuss this option further or have any other inquiries, feel free to schedule a time for us to chat via Zoom by finding a suitable slot here: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).
