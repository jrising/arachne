> Below are descriptions from a paper SI on a number of structural modeling choices used in IAMs when calculating the social cost of carbon:
> ===
> \subsection{Ambiguity / Model Uncertainty}
> 
> Climate policy grapples with many kinds and sources of uncertainty, and in many cases there is no agreed-upon quantitative distribution to describe that uncertainty. When multiple possible distributions are available, this problem is referred to as model ambiguity, and solutions typically assume that agents make pessimistic assumptions across the range of possibilities. A standard implementation of model ambiguity would follow a minimax approach, minimizing the welfare loss under the worst set of assumptions.
> 
> Higher values of the SCC represent larger losses in welfare for any emissions scenario, so model ambiguity selects higher values of the SCC across any range of possible values. Model ambiguity can also be included when selecting the optimal emission pathway. In this case, model ambiguity results in more cautionary decision-making, lower emissions, and a resulting lower SCC. In this context, the particular role of model ambiguity and the definition of the scenario (exogenous or optimal) is central.

> \subsection{Earth System}
> 
> Studies in this class make changes to the structure of the carbon cycle or warming modules relative to the simple 2-3 box carbon-cycle model and simple radiative-balance model used in versions of DICE, FUND and PAGE up to 2016. These modules map carbon dioxide emissions into atmospheric concentrations and atmospheric concentrations into climatic changes (principally temperature increases), respectively. Some models might add carbon-cycle feedbacks or might collapse the process into a single functional relationship between cumulative emissions and temperature, following evidence in more recent climate science \cite{Allen2009}.
> 
> The Earth system representation matters for the SCC because it determines how much temperatures, and where relevant other climatic variables, respond to CO2 emissions.

> Example Citations: \cite{hansel2020climate,dietz2021economic}
> 
> \subsection{Epstein-Zin Preferences}
> 
> Epstein-Zin utility functions disentangle risk across time and states of nature, introducing both a richer set of preferences and the need to solve models recursively. While these types of utility functions have become standard in financial economics over the past 2-3 decades, they are relatively new in climate-economy models. Models that incorporate Epstein-Zin preferences are either computationally involved empirical calibration exercises or highly stylized, attempting to tease out the importance of individual parameters in a set of sensitivity analyses.
> 
> Epstein-Zin preferences matter for the SCC, as they ensure that higher risk aversion does not lead to higher discount rates, which in turn lead to lower SCCs. The greater the uncertainties and risk aversion, the greater is the impact of switching to Epstein-Zin preferences on the SCC.
> 
> Example Citations: \cite{daniel2019declining,cai2019social}
> 
> \subsection{Distributional Weighting}
> 
> The same monetary loss results in a greater welfare loss in poorer regions than it does in richer regions under commonly-assumed concave utility functions. Climate change is also projected to affect income groups differently. For instance, poorer regions are often in warmer areas and are expected to have some of the greatest climate impacts. 
> 
> Distributional weighting, namely applying weights to dollar-valued impacts to different income groups, is typically used to operationalize inequality aversion. This can capture the higher welfare effect of income losses to poorer people and / or policy preferences that prioritize the well-being of the worst off. If poorer regions are exposed to greater climate impacts, then accounting for inequality aversion can produce large increases in the SCC.

> 
> \subsection{Learning}
> 
> Models that incorporate learning allow the distribution over one or more unknown parameters to evolve over time, typically through a Bayesian update, as data generated by the relationship governed by the unknown parameter are observed over time. Some of the learning models are myopic in that the social planner in the model does not anticipate future learning. Other learning models are forward-looking where the social planner anticipates future learning and adjusts policy accounting for how it affects learning and subsequent welfare. A plurality of the papers in the literature have focused on learning about the equilibrium climate sensitivity – which can be learned from observations of temperature and levels of greenhouse gases – while other papers have included learning about damages, climatic and damage tipping points, and other aspects of the climate economy.
> 
> Learning matters for the SCC because as policymakers refine distributions over unknown parameters, they are better able to match climate policy to the true state of the system which will affect the SCC. Learning typically reduces the SCC because of active learning motives where additional carbon emissions magnify the signal of the unknown parameter relative to background noise, allowing for faster learning. Theoretically, learning’s effect is a priori ambiguous and depends on nonlinearities and stock effects in the climate-economy.

> 
> \subsection{Limited Substitutability}
> 
> These models explicitly allow for limited substitutability by disaggregating a comprehensive consumption good or a comprehensive capital stock into more detailed component parts. For instance, these model changes feature non-market environmental goods as a direct source of utility and allow for various degrees of substitutability with standard produced consumption goods. These models also typically disaggregate the effects of climate damages on both market and non-market goods. 
> 
> As standard IAMs, like the DICE model, implicitly feature some degree of limited substitutability (Drupp and Hänsel 2021), the effect of explicitly introducing limited substitutability on the SCC is ambiguous. When the degree of substitutability between consumption and environmental goods is lower than in standard models, these model structures can substantially increase the SCC.

> 
> \subsection{Persistent / Growth Damages}
> 
> Models that allow for persistent or growth damages introduce pathways for transient changes in temperature to have permanent effects on output. This is usually modeled as temperature affecting the growth rate of factor productivity or increasing the depreciation rate of capital stocks. 
> 
> Accounting for persistent impacts of temperature generally increases the SCC. If temperature has persistent effects, then a temperature shock today affects output today and in future years. Conditional on a particular instantaneous damage function, this will increase total damages and the SCC.
> 
> Example Citations: \cite{moore2015temperature,ricke2018country}
> 
> \subsection{Tipping Points: Climate}
> 
> Climate tipping points/elements have been defined as “subsystems of the Earth system that are at least subcontinental in scale and can be switched – under certain circumstances – into a qualitatively different state by small perturbations” (Lenton et al., 2008). Examples include the permafrost carbon feedback, melting of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets, and a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Some models include a representation of the key underlying geophysical relationships that govern the tipping point, while others simulate climate tipping points in a stylized way.
> 
> Climate tipping points are diverse in nature and affect the SCC in different ways. Some are positive feedbacks in the climate system that increase the temperature response to CO2 emissions, for example the permafrost carbon feedback. Ice sheet melting increases sea levels and thereby increases coastal adaptation costs and residual costs/damages. Large-scale circulation changes such as AMOC slowdown may primarily change the distribution of impacts across countries and this may affect the overall SCC depending on the incomes of the countries most affected.

> 
> \subsection{Tipping Points: Damages} 
> 
> Models that incorporate damage tipping points allow for economic output to be irreversibly reduced, potentially stochastically, if a particular climate threshold is crossed. Damage tipping points are stylized ways of capturing sudden non-linarities in impacts that could be associated either with abrupt climate system changes (the climate tipping points described above) or thresholds in socio-economic impacts from those changes (e.g. large-scale dislocations such as war or mass migrations). These models incorporate a new state variable that captures the extent of tipping and the probability of this state variable progressing (capturing further advances in tipping and greater damage) depends on the state of the climate system and random shocks. 
> 
> Damage tipping points matter for the SCC because crossing a tipping threshold irreversibly moves us into a higher-damage world. This tends to increase the SCC because the value of the next ton of carbon must now account for the probability that the tipping threshold is crossed and the subsequent permanent increase in damages (though the SCC then drops once the tipping point is crossed).
