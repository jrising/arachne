> With LangChain, I am trying to call an LLM (a local LLM stored on my computer) and just get out a single token. I figure this should be the fastest thing an LLM can do. But I'm surprised to see that when I let it return many tokens, it takes very little extra time. Isn't the LLM a transformer network that has to get evaluated separately for each token it produces? Is there a way to ask the LLM to just do the processing necessary to produce a single token?

> It sounds like your observations are correct based on the structure of transformer models like GPT-3 and typical implementations of such models. Transformer models predict the next token in sequence by taking an input context, running it through multiple layers of transformers, and applying a softmax function on the final layer's output to generate a probability distribution for the next token.
> 
> As per the nature of transformer models, these steps must be performed regardless of whether one token or many tokens are being predicted. Therefore, generating a single token involves a nearly identical computational load as generating multiple tokens. The primary computational expense is in processing the entire input context, not in generating the individual tokens.
> 
> However, there is a nuance here. The situation changes a bit when you're generating many tokens without any new input coming in between generations. In this case, most transformer-based models, such as GPT-3, can reuse the previous computation when generating subsequent tokens. This is what makes generating many tokens only slightly slower than generating one token.

> From your question, it sounds like LangChain is using a transformer model that is implemented with this kind of efficiency. Consequently, you won't be able to significantly speed up the computations by asking it to generate only one token.

> However, various implementation tricks can speed up transformer models. The details would depend on your precise needs and constraints. For instance, if your input sequences are very long, certain parts of the computation can be trimmed or approximated for speed. If you give me more specifics, I might be able to recommend potential approaches.
