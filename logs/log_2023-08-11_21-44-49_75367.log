> I am using a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy to identify resources and activities that should be taken into account for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. Here is a section of that report:
> ---
> Human Use
> Areas of precaution for wind turbine development carry spatial use conflicts where development may be preferable, although developers and resource managers will have significant considerations and prioritizing in the areas represented. A variety of human uses exist in the study area, from ongoing activity to submerged obstructions.
> 
> Dump Sites
> Three former dump sites are located on NOAA Navigational Charts which are potentially problematic for turbine installations and cable-laying. Polygons indicating dump sites are located within the study area. These three dump sites were digitized from a NOAA Chart and added as polygon features (Map 44). The dump sites are a discontinued municipal sewage sludge site, a discontinued acid waste site, and a site where explosives were previously dumped, respectively west to east. Furthermore, a location of a potential residual mine dump area located close to the Delaware North and South firing ranges is described in a USACE Environmental Assessment (USACE, 2000). This area was imported as an image, referenced and digitized as a polygon feature. Dump sites, including a potential residual UXO mine area, are also considered areas where careful consideration must be given to the priorities of the region. Dump sites containing hazardous materials may be a health and safety concern.
> Submarine Cables
> Cables and pipelines that have been installed undersea previously are included in this analysis in order to identify areas of the seafloor unsuitable for turbine installation and additional cable lines. Existing cables may include telecommunication cables or oil and gas pipelines, some of which are currently in use, while others are non-operational. The majority of hazard cables are buried in the eastern section of the study area. Existing subsea cable lines were downloaded as a shapefile of polyline features from the Multipurpose Marine Cadastre (BOEM-NOAA, 2011). Data came as a merged feature class from several disparate sources, provided through NOAA’s Electronic Navigation Charts (Map 44). Through the data collection process, it was learned that many submerged cables are not accurately charted, and some may not be charted at all, including those that are privately owned and government owned (Personal communication, C. Creese, 14 November 2011). Identification of additional known cables is important for future research in this region.

**assistant**:
> Let's extract the resources and activities based on the information you've provided:
> 
> **Activity Name:** Waste Dump Sites  
> **Description:** There are former dump sites, some of which contain hazardous materials. These are places that received materials such as municipal sewage sludge, acid waste, and explosives. There is also a potential residual mine dump area.  
> **Current Status:** These are discontinued dump sites. However, their existence may still pose challenges for development activities such as turbine installations and cable-laying.  
> **Spatial Extent:** The study mentions three locations, distributed from west to east, and an additional one near the Delaware North and South firing ranges. More specific details could be obtained from the referenced NOAA Chart (Map 44) and USACE Environmental Assessment.  
> **Temporal Pattern:** Not specified in the provided excerpt.  
> **Potential Expansion/Changes:** There’s no mention of any potential changes or expansion of these sites since they are already discontinued.  
> **Stakeholders:** Developers, resource managers, environmentalists, potentially nearby communities due to health and safety concerns.   
> **Sources:** NOAA Navigational Charts, USACE Environmental Assessment (USACE, 2000).  
> **Other notes:** Special precautions must be taken in these areas due to potential health and safety concerns.

> **Activity Name:** Submarine Cables  
> **Description:** There are undersea cables and pipelines installed in the past for telecommunication, oil and gas. Some are operational, while others are non-operational.  
> **Current Status:** Submarine cables are a mixture of operational and non-operational lines. The majority of hazardous cables are in the eastern section of the study area.  
> **Spatial Extent:** Specific data about their placement would be available from the referenced Multipurpose Marine Cadastre (BOEM-NOAA, 2011) and NOAA’s Electronic Navigation Charts (Map 44).  
> **Temporal Pattern:** Not specified in the provided excerpt.  
> **Potential Expansion/Changes:** Identification and charting of submerged cables, particularly privately and government-owned ones not currently charted, is an area for future development and research.  
> **Stakeholders:** Telecommunication companies, oil and gas companies, developers, and various government entities.  
> **Sources:** Multipurpose Marine Cadastre (BOEM-NOAA, 2011), NOAA’s Electronic Navigation Charts.  
> **Other notes:** Due to inaccuracies in charting and the presence of uncharted cables, it’s critical to properly identify all cables for future development activities.
