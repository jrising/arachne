> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."

> Second, here is a peer's statement for comparison:
> ---
> Since my appointment at UC Davis I have taught 5 different courses, of which 3 are completely new classes developed by myself (or in one case with a co-instructor) and one of which I substantially overhauled when I began teaching. My classes mostly focus on teaching environmental policy evaluation, including principles of economic analysis, to undergraduate and graduate students without economics backgrounds (ESP 168a, taught 5 times; ENV 200b, taught twice). Making this technical material accessible and relevant to all students is a pedagogical challenge. My teaching philosophy focuses on developing general quntitative skills and on demonstrating the application of the material through applied examples.
> My largest class is ESP 168a: Methods of Environmental Policy Evaluation (5 units), which I have taught 5 times with enrollment varying between 90 and 120 students. The course is required in our Environmental Policy Analysis and Planning major and minor and covers methods relevant to the analysis of environmental policy. I fully revised the curriculum for this class, producing new lectures, problem sets, and in-class case studies. The problem sets help students develop skills in modeling, data analysis, and data visualization. Case-studies apply material learned in class to real-world regulatory analysis problems (such as lifecycle greenhouse gas impacts of the Renewable Fuel Standard). Student evaluations have been consistently positive, with recent class and instructor ratings ranging between 4.3 and 4.8 out of 5 (including one quarter taught online via Zoom due to the COVID 19 pandemic).
> Jointly with Professor Robert Hijmans, I have developed a new undergraduate class - ESP 106: Introduction to Environmental Data Science (3 units), which will be a core class in a new Environmental Data Science track in the Environmental Science and Management major. The goal of this class is to equip students interested in environmental science and policy with a foundation in programming and data analysis they can build on in their studies and future careers. Comfort with quantitative data analysis is increasingly important in many environmental careers but modern data analysis tools have a high barrier to entry. The class teaches students with no prior background the fundamentals of programming in R, good coding practices, principles of data analysis and visualization, and introduces spatial data analysis. The class was taught for the first time in 2021 and received excellent class (4.2) and instructor scores (4.7), particularly given the challenges of teaching coding remotely.
> My graduate teaching is in the Environmental Policy and Management (EPM) masters program. I developed a new core class for that program, ENV 203: Environmental Policy Clinic, which I taught twice. This class is a capstone experience for the EPM students, based on the law school clinic model, and involves a six month group project working with an external partner. The standard of projects has been high, with both students and client organizations expressing satisfaction with the model. I have twice taught the core environmental economics class in that program (ENV 200b: Environmental Policy Evaluation) which covers principles of economic analysis, market failures, and policy instrument design for professional masters students. I also provide guest lectures to graduate courses in Ecology and Agriculture and Resource Economics.
> I am affiliated with five graduate groups  (Agriculture and Resource Economics, Energy Systems, Geography, Ecology, and EPM) and as a result work with graduate students from a range of disciplines. I have worked closely with three PhD students. Two were in the Agriculture and Resource Economics graduate group and graduated in 2020. Of these I was co-chair of the dissertation committee for one (Matthew Gammans) and a committee member for another (Jesus Gonzalez). I am sole advisor for Bernie Bastien who is completing his 4th year in the Geography Graduate Group and is on track to graduate next year. Both Jesus and Bernie have published papers overseen and guided by myself that have appeared in highly respected journals (Nature Sustainability, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, and Environmental Research Letters). I have also advised undergraduate research. Arianna Stokes completed her undergraduate thesis under my supervision and is currently second author on a paper in revision for the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economics (8). I have advised 9 professional masters students in the EPM program, of whom 5 have graduated.
> I have participated in 8 qualifying exams for four graduate groups within UC Davis (Agriculture and Resource Economics, Geography, Transportation Technology and Policy, and Energy), and was an external member for a qualifying exam at Dartmouth University.

> I strongly believe in student-directed and project-based learning. The deepest learning comes from a mix of passion and failure, both of which are best cultivated in environments where students are free to develop their own bold projects.  Although this approach places a significant onus of self-direction on students, teachers have a crucial role to play, as my experiences show.

> 
> My journey as an education instructor began during my undergraduate years at MIT, where I participated in the Experimental Study Group. Through this experience, I had the privilege of serving as the primary or co-instructor for eight semester-long seminars, on an eclectic range of subjects - from Lego Robotics to a class on Technology and Culture. Besides these formal teaching engagements, I also facilitated numerous informal study seminars designed to encourage peer teaching and cooperative learning. Following graduation, I further honed my teaching skills at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering for two years. Here, I was trusted with managing labs and recitations for electrical engineering classes. In this newly established institution, I not only developed new curriculum material, but also involved myself in the broader process of building the school.
> 
> At Columbia University, my interest in curriculum design reached another level. Collaborating with two fellow Ph.D. students, I assisted in developing a course on Complexity Science, which has been taught twice so far. The course material has since been expanded and is currently in the process of being formally published as an Earth Institute Sustainable Development Primer. I also contributed to the development of an updated syllabic structure for interdisciplinary, graduate-level environmental science, and a course focusing on computational methods for researchers in sustainable development. Alongside this, I have held targeted tutorials as part of the course instruction.
> 
> My teaching philosophy is intertwined with the belief in student-directed and project-based learning. I am firm in my belief that the most profound learning takes place from a unique confluence of passion and failure, which can be readily observed in settings where students have the freedom to innovate and implement their own projects. However, I also recognize the crucial guiding role teachers have to play in such environments to steer the learning outcome positively.

> Since joining the University of Delaware faculty, I have spearheaded the development of three new courses: (1) Climate Change Economics, for which I created both an undergraduate and graduate version, supported by a course development grant; (2) Complex Systems Analysis, a graduate methods course aimed at comprehending the nonlinear, multiscale complexities underlying real data; and (3) Philosophy of Research, a seminar that delves into the epistemological, ethical, and societal cornerstones of sound research. Simultaneously, I undertook a comprehensive revision of a pre-existing course on Coupling Human to Natural Systems, thereby providing a fresh, interdisciplinary perspective on human-nature interactions and modeling through system dynamics.
> 
> In furtherance of my career objectives, I am also in the process of formulating a new course titled "The Future of Food." This course seeks to provide a global, quantitative outlook on the interplay of climate change, land and water use, government policies, and markets - and the impact of these on agriculture, fisheries, and food security over the coming 30 years.
