> Dear Arqam,
> 
> Thanks for your last email. I’m cc’ing here Professors Rising and Oremus from the Environmental Economics program, and Sharon Wiegner, our business administrator.
> 
> We appreciate your interest in the Environmental Economics program, and we want to provide a realistic answer to your request for a transfer from your current program.
> 
> While Professor Rising is interested in advising you, he does not have the funding to support you. Because you’re funded by the Biden School rather than the Graduate College, I don’t believe there’s any expectation that your current funding could be transferred to us.
> 
> Without a funding plan, I am afraid we cannot support your transfer to the Environmental Economics program.
> 
> If you do identify a different faculty member in the EE program who is willing to advise you and has the funding to support your studies I’d be happy to work with you on either a transfer or a new application.

> Thank you for your response, Professor Moffat. My apology for a very delayed response as I got busy after the birth of my daughter and thank you to Professor Rising for agreeing to advise me. I understand that funding is an issue regarding transferring to the environmental economics program. I have a plan, if you agree, we can work on that.
> 
> If I submit the application or if internal adjustment is possible, the EE department may offer me a provisional admission without funding. As far as funding is concerned, I have already taken it up with my department and I shall be better informed in summer (end of June or early July). I will make every effort to get maximum funding. If they agree to provide a year of funding, is it possible that I shift to the EE program and during that year, the EE program can fund me for the remaining time as they will be able to get some stream of funding during that period or I can also search with funding from a graduate college or some other potential avenues in the University during that year, such as looking for some RA or TA opportunities other than the EE program, which will help in funding the program? Alternatively, although chances are rare but may be I am able to find some funding in the shape of RA at the Biden School. I know it may not be the best plan but at least it can get me started.

> Not sure if that can work. We cannot guarantee funding at any point if we admit you as a self-pay student. Also, in SMSP, self-pay students are not given full benefits of TAships, so I would worry about not setting you up in the best way.
> 
> You are in a better position to look for that funding now, with a paid PhD, and if you got it you could transfer over.

> Dear Arqam,
> 
> Thank you for your email, and congratulations on the birth of your daughter.
> 
> I appreciate your initiative in exploring options to secure funding for a potential transfer to the Environmental Economics program. However, I must emphasize that we cannot guarantee funding if you are admitted as a self-pay student. Additionally, within the School of Marine Science and Policy, self-pay students do not receive the full benefits of teaching assistantships, which may not set you up in the best possible way for a successful transition.
> 
> At this point, you are in a better position to seek funding within your current program, where you have a paid PhD, and should you secure such funding, we could then consider a transfer.
> 
> Should you wish to discuss this matter further, please feel free to schedule a time for a Zoom chat using my calendar: [zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).

> Thank you for your understanding, and I wish you the best in pursuing all available opportunities.
