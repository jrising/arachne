> I would like you to help me develop the form questions for this, using multiple choice and I will be implementing this with Google Form's conditional direction to different sections based on the responses. The form should provide explanation as it goes, and ultimately end with information about a particular program and an automatic email sent to one of us to evaluate the outcome. It should also be fairly short, to minimize the busy work for good candidates, while also ensuring that most people (who do not end up being good candidates, because of lack of funding or quantitative skills mostly) realize this.

> I will ask for your help one question at a time, and I am looking for specific form options, explanatory text, etc.

> First, I want to ascertain if they interested in a social science or natural science degree. I think we need to ask their interests disciplinarily, and provide several options which we then categorize as social science, natural science, or interdisciplinary. In addition to the degrees above, we frequently get emails about other degrees run by SMSP, and most commonly the marine biology degrees. They won't necessarily know what different disciplines entail though, so I'm not sure how to organize it.
**assistant**:
> To effectively guide prospective applicants, we can start by designing a questionnaire that helps them express their interests without requiring deep disciplinary knowledge. The first question should focus on broad academic interests and provide clear explanations. Here’s how it could be structured:
> 
> ---
> 
> **Question 1: What area most closely aligns with your academic interests when considering a graduate degree in environmental or marine studies?**
> 
> *Explanatory Text:* To help us guide you to the right program, please select the area that best describes your academic interests. If you're unsure, choose the one that closely fits the topics you're most passionate about.
> 
> **Options:**
> 
> 1. **Marine Policy and Management**  
>    *(Social Science)* - Focuses on policy-making, management, and the societal impacts of marine ecosystems.
> 
> 2. **Environmental Economics**  
>    *(Social Science)* - Examines economic approaches to environmental issues and resource management.
> 
> 3. **Interdisciplinary Environmental Science & Management**  
>    *(Interdisciplinary)* - Combines scientific research with management practices to tackle environmental challenges.
> 
> 4. **Quantitative Environmental Modeling**  
>    *(Social Science/Interdisciplinary)* - Involves rigorous quantitative analysis and modeling of environmental systems.
> 
> 5. **Marine Biology**  
>    *(Natural Science)* - Studies the organisms and ecosystems in oceans and seas.
> 
> 6. **Oceanography and Marine Sciences**  
>    *(Natural Science)* - Focuses on the physical and biological aspects of marine environments.
> 
> 7. **Other/Not Sure**  
>    *If you’re unsure or considering a different field, feel free to select this option.*

> This question is crafted to help candidates express their interest. Based on their choices, the form can guide them to the relevant program and provide tailored information or follow-up questions. Let me know what you think, and if you’d like to proceed with the next step or modify this approach!
**user**:
> Great. If they selected Marine Policy and Management, Environmental Economics, or Interdisciplinary Environmental Policy (renamed that one), I want to evaluate their taste for quantitative work. If they express high capacity, then we will follow-up with specific questions about their background. For this, we need them to upload the transcripts and to specify if they have had microeconomics, calculus, statistics, and/or programming. Maybe using a multiple choice grid for that.
**assistant**:
> That sounds like a solid plan! Using a multiple-choice grid will allow candidates to indicate their quantitative background in a clear and concise manner. Here’s how you can structure the question:
> 
> ---
> 
> **Question 2: Please indicate your experience with the following quantitative subjects by selecting the highest level of coursework you have completed. If you haven't taken the course, please leave it blank.**
> 
> *Explanatory Text:* Your responses will help us assess your quantitative skills, which are important for success in our programs. You’ll also have the opportunity to upload your transcripts at the end of this section.

> This grid format allows for an overview of their quantitative background in a straightforward way. After this question, you can implement a file upload prompt for their transcripts. Would you like to proceed with the next question or make any modifications?
**user**:
> Let's first put in the intermediate question-- do you have a quantitative background? That could be split into three options from none/no interest to lots/high interest. Can you write this out more clearly, and include in explanatory text for the question why we're asking?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here’s a clear structure for the intermediate question about their quantitative background, along with explanatory text to provide context:
> 
> ---
> 
> **Question 2: How would you describe your interest and experience in quantitative work?**
> 
> *Explanatory Text:* Understanding your quantitative background is crucial for assessing how well our programs align with your skills and interests. This information will help us guide you to the most suitable program and resources. Please select one of the following options:
> 
> 1. **None/No Interest**  
>    *I do not have experience with quantitative work and I am not interested in pursuing it further.*
> 
> 2. **Some Interest**  
>    *I have limited experience with quantitative work, but I am open to engaging with it more in my studies.*
> 
> 3. **Lots/High Interest**  
>    *I have significant experience and a strong interest in quantitative work, and I am eager to apply these skills in my studies.*
> 
> ---
> 
> This setup allows them to self-evaluate their interest and readiness for quantitative aspects of the program. After this question, you could proceed with the multiple-choice grid to gather more detailed information about their specific coursework. Would you like to continue with the next steps or adjust this one further?
