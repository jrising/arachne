**user**:
> I have wave height and period from NOAA buoys. Can I use this to estimate ocean current speeds?
**assistant**:
> Wave height and period data don't directly provide information about ocean current speeds. Wave properties are primarily determined by wind speed, wind duration, and the fetch (the distance over which the wind has blown). While waves can be influenced by currents, especially in interactions with the sea floor near coastlines, it's not straightforward to deduce current velocities from them.
> 
> For a more direct estimation of ocean current speeds, you'd typically want measurements from specialized ocean current meters, like Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs), or infer from satellite altimetry data, which uses the shape of the sea surface to infer the underlying current structures. 
> 
> However, data from NOAA's High Frequency Radar (HFR) might be what you need. HFR can provide real-time surface current measurements over large regions of the coastal ocean. Ocean current velocities from HFR are available along with standard meteorological data and oceanographic measurements from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center.
