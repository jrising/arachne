> Is it more standard in Julia to have the working directory for scripts be the root of the repository or the location of the script? For example, I have a script in `src/main.jl` which includes another file `src/helper.jl`. Should the convention be that I have the working directory be in `src` so I just say `include("helper.jl")` or should it be the root so I say `include("src/helper.jl")`?

> In Julia, it is more standard to set the working directory to the root of the repository rather than the location of the script. This convention supports cleaner project management and easier collaboration. By placing the working directory at the root, you can reference files consistently across the entire project, and it aligns with practices in other languages and frameworks that have a similar structure.

> Thus, you should use `include("src/helper.jl")` from the root directory. This approach also benefits package developmentâ€”since it aligns the structure with that of package environments in Julia which typically operate from the root directory.

**assistant**:

> This keeps the references consistent throughout the project and prevents issues that may arise if the working directory changes (for example, when running scripts from different folders or using different environments). Maintaining a clear and predictable file structure helps not only with readability but also with troubleshooting and collaboration.

**assistant**:
> The issue you're facing arises because the path you are specifying in `testdir1.jl` is relative to the current working directory when you run the script. When you do `include("src/testdir1.jl")` from the root, the current directory is the root, so the `include("src/testdir2.jl")` in `testdir1.jl` is interpreted as trying to resolve `src/src/testdir2.jl`.
> 
> To fix this, you should adjust the include statement in `src/testdir1.jl` to use a relative path that reflects the structure from its own location. You can use either of the following methods:

>        include(joinpath(dirname(@__FILE__), relative_path))
>    end

>    include_from_here("testdir2.jl")
>    ```
> 
> By using one of these methods, `src/testdir1.jl` will correctly find `src/testdir2.jl` regardless of where the script is invoked from. This approach helps preserve modularity and usability throughout your project.
**user**:
> That's all fine. But there's a point here: when you do `include("src/file.jl")`, it changes the working directory for further includes to `src/`. So, first, your `include("src/other.jl")` doesn't work. Second, it makes me wonder if the general convention for Julia is always to use the working directory of the file, since that's what's enforced by `include`.
**assistant**:
> You're correct in pointing out that the behavior of `include()` in Julia can lead to some confusion regarding working directories when working with scripts, especially since it can change the effective working directory for subsequent code.
> 
> ### Key Points:
> 
> 1. **Working Directory Behavior**: 
>    When you call `include("src/file.jl")`, it executes the code in `file.jl` with the current working directory set to where `file.jl` resides. This can lead to further `include()` calls in that file being relative to `src/` instead of the project root. This can indeed foster a tendency to use paths relative to the file's location instead of the project's root.
> 
> 2. **Conventions**: 
>    While Julia does allow the working directory to be modified by `include()`, the more common convention is to:
>    - Set the working directory to the project root when starting scripts or running from the REPL. This maintains consistency in how files are referenced across the project.
>    - Explicitly use relative paths that reference the project root when including other scripts, to avoid confusion with changing directories.
> 
> 3. **Best Practices**:
>    - **Always reference files from the project root** (e.g., `include("src/other.jl")`) when you run from the root.
>    - Alternatively, structure your files home-relative (like using a helper function to handle path resolution relative to the file's location), but this can lead to non-standard code that may confuse collaborators.
> 
> ### Summary
> 
> While the behavior of `include()` can lead to changing the working directory, the best practice is to think of your code in terms of the project structure from the root. This helps maintain a standardized approach across different environments and use cases in Julia, aligning it with more general programming practices in larger projects.
