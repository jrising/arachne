> How much of the energy of fossil fuel combustion is due to energy released when we break the C-H bond, and how much is due to the strength of the generated CO2 and H2O bonds?
**assistant**:
> In fossil fuel combustion, the energy primarily comes from the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. Here's a basic breakdown of the energy contributions:
> 
> 1. **Breaking of C-H Bonds**: Fossil fuels, which include compounds like methane (CH₄) and other hydrocarbons, store energy in their C-H bonds. Breaking these bonds requires energy input.
> 
> 2. **Forming of C=O Bonds in CO₂ and O-H Bonds in H₂O**: When these fuels combust, carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) are formed. The process of bond formation in these molecules releases a significant amount of energy due to the high bond energies of C=O in CO₂ and O-H in H₂O.
> 
> ### Energy Contributions:
> 
> - **C-H Bonds**:
>   - C-H bond dissociation energy is around 413 kJ/mol.
> 
> - **Forming Bonds in Combustion Products**:
>   - C=O bond energy in CO₂ is about 799 kJ/mol.
>   - O-H bond energy in H₂O is approximately 467 kJ/mol.
> 
> ### Overall Energy Dynamics:
> 
> - **Methane Combustion Example**:
>   - **Combustion Reaction**: \( CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O \)
>   - Total energy required to break bonds in CH₄ and O₂: Two C-H bonds and two O=O bonds are broken.
>   - Total energy released from forming bonds in CO₂ and H₂O: Two C=O bonds and four O-H bonds are formed.
> 
> The energy involved can be described by comparing the energy required to break the initial bonds (e.g., C-H and O=O) and the energy released from forming the new bonds (e.g., C=O and O-H).
> 
> #### Quantitatively:
> - **Energy Required**:
>   - Breaking 4 C-H bonds in CH₄: \( 4 \times 413 = 1652 \) kJ/mol
>   - Breaking 2 O=O bonds: \( 2 \times 498 = 996 \) kJ/mol
>   - Total: 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ/mol
> 
> - **Energy Released**:
>   - Forming 2 C=O bonds: \( 2 \times 799 = 1598 \) kJ/mol
>   - Forming 4 O-H bonds: \( 4 \times 467 = 1868 \) kJ/mol
>   - Total: 1598 + 1868 = 3466 kJ/mol
> 
> - **Net Energy Released**: 3466 kJ/mol (released) - 2648 kJ/mol (required) = 818 kJ/mol
> 
> Thus, the majority of the energy released in fossil fuel combustion comes from the energy released during the formation of the strong bonds in CO₂ and H₂O, compared to the energy required to break the initial bonds in the fuel.
> 
> This energy release is what makes fossil fuels such a potent energy source but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.
