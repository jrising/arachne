> As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I am unable to provide current information on specific researchers at the University of Delaware. However, it is common for faculty and research interests to change over time. I recommend visiting the University of Delaware's Economics, Applied Economics, and Business School department websites to check for updated faculty listings and their research interests. You can usually find a list of faculty members along with their research interests and recent publications on these websites.
> 
> You may also want to explore the University of Delaware's Center for Energy & Environmental Policy (CEEP) or the Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN), as these centers may have researchers working on topics related to Just Transitions and the green transition.

> Which researchers from these departments would be most likely to have work in the green transition?
**assistant**:
> As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, I can't provide specific names of researchers at the University of Delaware who might be working on the green transition, as this data changes frequently and is continuously updated by the university. However, here are some general tips to help you identify potential researchers:
> 
> 1. **Expertise**: Look for faculty who specialize in environmental economics, sustainable business practices, energy economics, or related fields. These professors are more likely to be involved in research on the green transition.
> 
> 2. **Publications**: Check the recent publications of faculty members. Researchers actively publishing work related to environmental policy, sustainability, or green energy are likely involved in the green transition.
> 
> 3. **Projects and Grants**: Often, universities will list ongoing projects and the source of their research grants. Look for projects related to the green transition, climate change, sustainability, or renewable energy.
> 
> 4. **Partnerships**: Some faculty members might be involved in interdisciplinary work or partnerships with environmental studies departments, sustainability initiatives, or centers like the Center for Energy & Environmental Policy (CEEP) or the Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN), which would suggest their interest in this area.
> 
> Remember to check the University of Delaware's official website or contact the relevant departments directly to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.
