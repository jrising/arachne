> In ggplot, how do I specify that I want a geom_point point to be shifted by a small, specified vertical displacement? The dimension I want to shift the points on is a categorical dimension (so, they currently show up for each category, but I want them to show up slightly above their current point).

> To achieve a small vertical displacement for points in `ggplot2` on a categorical axis, you can adjust the `position` of the `geom_point` by using `position_nudge()`. This allows you to nudge or shift the points by a specified amount. Since your dimension is categorical, you would typically use `position_nudge(y = ...)` to shift vertically. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```r
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Example data frame
> data <- data.frame(
>   category = factor(c("A", "B", "C")),
>   value = c(3, 5, 2)
> )
> 
> # Plot with nudged points
> ggplot(data, aes(x = category, y = value)) +
>   geom_point(position = position_nudge(y = 0.2))  # Adjust the 0.2 as needed
> ```
> 
> In this example, `position_nudge(y = 0.2)` shifts each point upwards by 0.2 units on the y-axis for each category. You can adjust the nudging value `(y = 0.2)` to whatever small displacement you desire. This allows you to visually separate points when they might otherwise overlap or to emphasize them above their categorical lines.
