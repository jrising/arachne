**assistant**:
> In Julia, you can extract the hour-of-day from a `DateTime` object using the `Hour` function from the `Dates` module. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
> 
> ```julia
> using Dates
> 
> # Create a sample DateTime object
> dt = DateTime("2024-07-15T12:34:56")
> 
> # Extract the hour-of-day
> hour_of_day = hour(dt)
> 
> println("The hour of day is: $hour_of_day")
> ```
> 
> In this example, `hour(dt)` returns the hour portion of the DateTime object `dt`. The output will be:
> 
> ```
> The hour of day is: 12
> ```
> 
> Let me know if you need any more help with DateTime manipulations!
