> Dear Professor Dr. Rising,
> 
> My name is Sourav Mukherjee, from India. I am writing to express my interest in pursuing PhD research under your valuable supervision.  I have completed my BSc. in Biotechnology in 2021, and an MSc in biotechnology in the fall of 2023. During my post-graduation, I was selected as a research intern at the National Centre For Polar and Ocean Research, Goa, India. After completing my post-graduation I got selected as an international research scholar intern at Yuan Ze University, Zhongli, Taiwan. I worked here as an international intern.
> 
> I saw your research interest and working field which is very interesting and similar to my area of interest. My research experience and background will enable me to make meaningful contributions to your research group. My research interests are marine biology, zooplankton, phytoplankton, fisheries, benthic ecology, molecular genetics, marine ecosystems, marine food webs, population genetics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics, etc.
> 
> I want your guidance as my supervisor. I also want to apply for the scholarship for my PhD research with advice. Please help me apply as a PhD student under your guidance. I attached my CV to this email. Thank you so much for your valuable time. I am looking forward to hearing from you about my application.

> Sourav Mukherjee expresses interest in pursuing a Ph.D. under your supervision, with a background in biotechnology, research experience in marine-related fields, and an interest in marine ecosystems and food webs. While Sourav's background aligns closely with your research interests, the email doesn't clarify which specific program they are aiming for. Given the focus on marine biology and related fields, they might be considering the Ph.D. in Marine Policy. Alternatively, the natural science programs could be a suitable path. 
> 
> If Sourav seems well-qualified for interdisciplinary quantitative modeling related to your research areas, you might encourage them to mention you in their statement of purpose. Clarify that Ph.D. funding is limited.

> Dear Sourav,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your impressive academic and research background. Given your interests in marine biology and ecosystems, I'd suggest looking into our Ph.D. programs, which could align well with your expertise and aspirations.
> 
> However, please note that funding for Ph.D. programs is limited. To strengthen your application, I encourage you to mention your interest in aligning your research with my work in your statement of purpose.

**user**:
> This definitely appears to be someone interested in a bioscience degree. We should direct them to Xinfeng.
**assistant**:
> That makes sense! Directing them to Xinfeng will ensure they get the appropriate guidance tailored to their bioscience interests. Here’s a revised draft response you can use to redirect Sourav Mukherjee:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Sourav,
> 
> Thank you for your email and for sharing your impressive background in biotechnology and marine research. While your interests align closely with my work, I believe it would be beneficial for you to connect with Dr. Xinfeng, who specializes in the biosciences and may provide more relevant guidance for your Ph.D. application.
> 
> I recommend reaching out to Dr. Xinfeng directly to discuss your research aspirations and possible opportunities within the program.
> 
> Best of luck with your application!
