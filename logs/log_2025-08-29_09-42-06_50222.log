> I am writing to express my interest in pursuing a PhD under your guidance in the fields of Sustainable Development, Circular Economy, and Climate Change.I completed my post-graduation Environmental Science degree at Noakhali Science & Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh. Visiting your homepage and your research expertise inspired me to express my interest in working with you as a PhD candidate at your lab in the fall of 2026. I obtained an excellent CGPA for my academic degree as well. In the meantime, I've picked up useful experience in the fields of working professionals, research, teaching, and volunteerism.  I am deeply motivated to contribute to interdisciplinary solutions for environmental and socio-economic sustainability.
> During my Master’s/Research experience, which sparked my interest in systemic waste management, climate adaptation strategies, and the practical applications of circular economy models in developing countries.I am especially interested in exploring how circular economy principles can be integrated into local development policies to enhance resilience and reduce carbon footprints in vulnerable regions. I am confident that under your mentorship, I can develop impactful research that contributes to both academic scholarship and practical transformation.
