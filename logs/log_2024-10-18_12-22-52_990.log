> # FY 2025 Fundraising Plan for IMT
> 
> ## 1. Executive Summary:
> This plan proposes a strategic approach for IMT’s fundraising efforts for FY 2025. Our goal is to increase our fund intake through philanthropic donations, corporate giving, and government grants.
> 
> ## 2. Goals & Objectives:
> - Increase total fundraising income by 20% compared to FY 2024.
> - Engage 30% more corporate donors.
> - Apply and secure at least ten new government grants.
> - Develop and nurture strong relationships with philanthropists for continued support.
> 
> ## 3. Strategies 
> 
> ### Philanthropic Grants and Corporate Giving:
> - Johanna Goetzel will take the lead in establishing a more proactive and targeted approach to identify and approach potential donors who share IMT’s commitment to sustainability.
> - Expand our corporate and individual giving networks by increasing marketing and networking efforts, including hosting events, attending conferences, and utilizing social media channels.
> - Storytelling will play a key role. Pitch materials will be developed to powerfully convey IMT’s mission, impact, and the potential for donors to make a difference.
> 
> ### Government Grants:
> - Shubhada Kambli will lead the vetting process of federal and government Request for Proposals (RFPs). The aim will be to identify opportunities that align with our strategic objectives and have a high likelihood of success.
> - Maddie Koolbeck will support the project management of the federal grants application process, ensuring tasks are delegated, timelines met, and that all submissions are cohesive and of high quality.
> - Sarah Beth Kaye and Betsy Law will oversee administrative components of the government grants process, ensuring compliance and reviewing budgets.
> - Jocelyn Perkins will handle budget creation, financial document creation, contract review, and compliance documents related to government grants.
> 
> ## 4. Implementation Timeline:
>   - **Q1**: Focus on identification and research of potential donors/grants, and creation of pitch materials.
>   - **Q2**: Engage potential donors through dedicated outreach, network, and submit grant applications.
>   - **Q3**: Follow-up with potential donors, submit additional grant applications.
>   - **Q4**: Review success of fundraising efforts and prepare strategies for FY 2026.
> 
> ## 5. Evaluation:
> We will evaluate our progress at the end of every quarter. Using metrics such as the number of grant applications submitted/awarded, total amounts raised, and donor engagement levels, we can adapt and refine our approach as necessary. 
> 
> This plan aligns with the understanding that Development and Finance are in partnership and that their successful collaboration is critical to our fundraising success. As such, clear communication and collaboration between the Development Team and other departments are also key components of this plan.
