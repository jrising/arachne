> Dear Dr. Rising, 
> 
> I hope this email finds you well. My name is Jace Bell, and I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Environmental Science and Biology at the University of Northern Iowa. In September, I was invited to deliver a research presentation at the University of Delaware and fell in love with the campus at UD. I am reaching out to express my interest in your research area and to inquire about the prospect of working under your mentorship as a prospective advisee at the University of Delaware in the fall of 2024.
> 
> My specific interest lies in your research on the economic impacts of climate change as well as your integrated approach to water systems, bringing together both social and hard sciences. This interest is closely aligned with my aspiration to pursue the M.S. Water Science & Policy program at UD. Your expertise in water systems, sustainable economics, and the implications of climate change on individual human livelihoods and society as a whole resonates with my academic and research goals.
> 
> It is my passion to understand the policy side of marine science, and I believe your research is greatly in line with what I am interested in. It would be an honor to learn more about your research and contribute to it through my background in water quality research and hydrologic management.
> 
> For your review, I have attached my resume and a copy of my transcript. I understand you have a busy schedule, but would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss your research opportunities for graduate students next fall. Thank you very much for your time and consideration of my inquiry.
> 
> Kindest regards,
> Jace Bell
**assistant**:
> The email from Jace Bell requests guidance and mentorship for the M.S. Water Science & Policy program at UD. Jace's academic interests align with your area of expertise, specifically in climate change economics and water systems, integrating social and hard sciences. They demonstrate a strong focus on marine policy and express an intent to contribute to your research using their background in water quality research and hydrologic management. Jace also attached their resume and transcript for your review. 
> 
> Based on Jace's expressed interest in marine-related policy and their background, the new Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program, with a Marine track, or Ph.D. in Marine Policy could be suitable options for them. 
> 
> Jace visited the University of Delaware in September for a research presentation and fell in love with the campus. However, it's not clear whether they are local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area. They are currently studying at the University of Northern Iowa. There's no sign that they have studied at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD.

> Dear Jace,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your academic and research interests align well with my area of study, and the University of Delaware offers several programs that could be a good fit.
> 
> Based on your described interests, especially your focus on marine policy, I would suggest you consider the Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program, which now offers a Marine track. Likewise, the Ph.D. program in Marine Policy could be a good fit, given your interest and experience with applying both social and hard sciences. 
> 
> Funding is limited for these programs so it would be advantageous to apply by the end of this calendar year to be considered for any possible funds. When applying, I would recommend mentioning your particular interest in my research area in your statement of purpose.
> 
> Do look over the programs and evaluate them against your career objectives. If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help clarify.
