> Is it possible to include a node in a neural network (specifically, a transformer network) that performs a function given its inputs other than the normal sum-and-transform operation? Specifically, I want to include a node that outputs a value drawn from a spatial dataset, where it interprets two input values as the latitude and longitude. Can such a node be added to a NN and then trained to be used?

> In the architecture of a conventional neural network, including transformers, each node performs some computation involving a linear (or affine) transformation followed by a nonlinear activation function. This does not ordinarily encompass drawing a value from a spatial dataset based on latitude and longitude inputs. The weights of nodes are also traditionally learned through training on a labeled dataset, not predefined with fixed functional formulas.

> However, your idea does sound like a sort of augmented architecture. If you want to integrate a spatial dataset lookup with neural network computations, one way could be to pre-process your input data such that each original pair of coordinates also includes the looked-up value from the spatial dataset. This way, the network still operates conventionally, learning from the value provided during training.

> Another approach might be to incorporate tensors derived from your spatial dataset (for example, a height map or some other kind of spatial density distribution) into your network. These tensors could be used as additional features or inputs to your network. The network could then in theory learn to associate certain spatial patterns with particular outputs. This would work nicely if you're working with convolutional networks, which are designed to recognize spatial patterns.

> On a more advanced note, you might want to look into *Differentiable Programming*. This involves combining neural networks with arbitrarily complex, differentiable (this part is very important) computations. Under a differentiable programming framework, you *could* include a node that performs a specific function (like the one you mentioned), provided that function is differentiable and you are able to define a loss function and a suitable way to backpropagate through it.

> All these methods require you to integrate this external geographical information into your model such that the standard optimization methods used for training neural networks still apply. Often this requires making sure that all operations are differentiable and that gradients can be computed for backpropagation.
