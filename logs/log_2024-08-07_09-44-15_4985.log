> Just to understand your climate research and if there are ways to collab. Easiest to coord is email, shaheer@aetlan.com. No rush

> I don't really want to have a conversation where we each explain our work. I've got other important things to do. But I don't want to be impolite-- maybe this person will some day be a friend. What should I say?

> Given your need to manage your time efficiently while still being polite, you could suggest a more streamlined way to exchange information. How about proposing to exchange summaries of your work over email first, which would allow both of you to assess the potential for collaboration without committing to a call right away? Here's a suggested response:

> Hi Shaheer,

> Thanks for reaching out and for your understanding. I'm currently managing a busy schedule, so it might be more efficient for us to start by exchanging summaries of our work via email. This way, we can both get a good sense of each other's research areas and identify any potential collaboration opportunities.
> 
> Please feel free to send me a brief overview of your work and interests, and I'll do the same. If it looks like there's a good fit, we can definitely set up a call to discuss further.
> 
> Best regards,  
> James

> This way, you keep the door open for future collaboration while respecting your time commitments.
