> I am trying to load a byte stream from a zip file in python, representing an netcdf file. I believe I can do that with the h5netcdf engine (rather than the normal netcdf4 engine). But although I have pip installed h5netcdf, I still get the error `unrecognized engine h5netcdf must be one of: ['netcdf4', 'scipy', 'rasterio', 'store', 'zarr']`. How do I fix this?
**assistant**:
> First, we should make sure `h5netcdf` is correctly installed in your current Python environment. Please run the following in your Python interpreter:
> 
> ```python
> import h5netcdf
> print(h5netcdf.__version__)
> ```
> 
> If it prints the version, we would know the installation is successful; else, we need to figure out why it's not being installed in the right environment. 
> 
> The error message suggests that `h5netcdf` isn't recognized as a valid engine by xarray (I'm assuming you're using xarray to read the netCDF file), which likely means it doesn't "see" the `h5netcdf` package. 
> 
> Assuming the `h5netcdf` is correctly installed, it could be that your local version of xarray doesn't support `h5netcdf` yet. Your error shows the available engines as: 'netcdf4', 'scipy', 'rasterio', 'store', 'zarr'. In more recent versions of xarray, 'h5netcdf' is included.
> 
> Therefore, updating your xarray version might resolve the issue. You can do it via pip:
> 
> ```bash
> pip install --upgrade xarray
> ```
> 
> Or via conda, if you're using an Anaconda environment:
> 
> ```bash
> conda update xarray
> ```
> 
> After you've updated, try running your script again and see if the error persists. 
> 
> If it does, verify again the version and environment of your Python library installations. Python often deals with multiple installations and environments, and it's possible an update or installation doesn't affect the environment you're using in your current session.
