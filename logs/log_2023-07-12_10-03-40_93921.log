> I help develop the PAGE integrated assessment model of climate change. One of its interesting features is that damages are computed in a way that accounts for adaptation-- up to a point-- and loss & damage beyond that. I want to keep this basic idea, but update the calibration to the most recent estimates. Where can I find climate damage estimates that follow this practice or something else compatible?

> Most integrated assessment models apply a single, constant percentage of GDP per degree of temperature change as a damage function. However, there are updated models and newer research papers which try to vary damage functions. Here are sources that you could look into for climate damage estimates:
> 
> 1. **Climate Impact Lab (CIL)**: The CIL combines econometric analysis, climate modeling, and risk assessment to develop local-level climate damage estimates. This research group uses historical climate and socio-economic data to estimate how different sectors have historically responded to changes in climate. They include adaptation in their damage functions. You can find peer-reviewed articles associated with the lab, as well an interactive data map on their [website](http://www.impactlab.org/).
> 
> 2. **National Climate Assessment (NCA)**: The NCA provides detailed climate impacts assessments for the United States, segmented by region and sector. You may be able to calibrate your damage function based on the sectoral impact projections provided in the most recent report. Check their [latest report and data](https://www.globalchange.gov/nca4).
> 
> 3. **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)**: The IPCC has assessment reports that summarize current literature across a wide range of climate impact categories. The upcoming AR6 Report may have updated information. You can access their [reports here](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/).
> 
> 4. **The DICE model**, by William Nordhaus: The DICE model has an updated damage function in its 2016 version. Although the DICE model is critiqued for its small estimated damages, it's one of the models that has been thoroughly described and updated over the years. You can find the [updated version here](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/homepage/DICE2016R2.htm).
> 
> 5. **"Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production", Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel, 2015**: This paper uses subnational data and within-country variation to estimate a non-linear damage function that could be useful for your purposes.
> 
> When integrating these damage functions, always pay attention to their regional, sectoral, and temporal scopes to make the results compatible with your model. These differences can greatly change the damage estimates. I recommend reviewing the methods and assumptions used in each paper or report to ensure compatibility with the PAGE model.
> 
> Don't forget to ensure the equity weighting methods applied are compatible with those in the PAGE model for consistency in your overall risk assessment. Consider the different socioeconomic pathways the studies may use, as these can influence the damage estimates and the feasibility of adaptation.
