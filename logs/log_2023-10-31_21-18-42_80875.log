**user**:
> I am making a binder about my child, and I want to include the song "Forever Young".
> Do you have any suggestions for a font to use that is reflective of that song?
**assistant**:
> The song "Forever Young" evokes a sense of nostalgic hope for the future, comfort, and an enduring youthfulness. Consequently, it could be well-represented best by a softer yet elegant font. Here are few font recommendations.
> 
> 1. **Reenie Beanie**: This Google font has a child-like, handwritten quality, embodying the youthful aspect of the song; yet its elegance keeps it from being too 'juvenile'.
> 
> 2. **Segoe Print**: This is a font that captures a similar handwritten spirit, but is a bit more refined and readable.
> 
> 3. **Sacramento**: This script font evokes vintage nostalgia while still maintaining readability, aligning well with the timeless quality of the song.
> 
> 4. **Kalam**: A casual handwriting-like font that captures the spontaneous, playful quality of being forever young.
> 
> Remember the most important thing is the readability and clear communication. Too decorative fonts might be harder to read and might tire the reader's eyes in longer texts. Always consider context and audience when choosing a font.
