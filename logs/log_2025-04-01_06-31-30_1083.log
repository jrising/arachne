> Planetary boundaries and ecosystem services are also key concepts in the NGFS Recommendations, toward the development of scenarios for assessing nature-related economic and financial risks, as found in the “NGFS Technical Document on Nature Scenarios.” An understanding of these concepts may therefore help to assess nature-related risks on a forward-looking basis. Specifically, planetary boundaries and ecosystem services play an important role in the development of nature scenario narratives—these are storylines that describe how the world could evolve in the future as a result of nature degradation or actions to address it.

> This is the general idea behind the ESGAP-SESi approach for narrative development as presented in the NGFS Technical Document on Nature Scenarios. Using twenty-one indicators of ecosystem health, such as outdoor air pollution, soil erosion rate, and fish resources, ESGAP-SESi provides an aggregate measure to determine the distance between the current state and a “healthy” operating state for different ecosystems. This distance can be used as a proxy to determine the potential occurrence of physical hazards. In other words, the closer a country is to crossing thresholds for these indicators, the less resilient the relevant ecosystem is and the more likely it becomes that physical hazards occur.

This approach focuses on potential hazards and maps the relationship between those hazards, that is, shocks such as a grain crop pest, the particular ecosystem services in a country or region, for instance, backwards to the disrupted ecosystem service ‘pest control’ and forwards to the effects it has on the food provisioning services and sectors that depend on it. Relevant hazards can be selected from an initial set of over fifty hazards based on the vulnerability of the relevant country or region to those hazards.
