**assistant**:
> To retrieve a numeric vector that is stored as a column in a data.table, you can use the indexing operator `[ ]` to subset the column you want. Here is an example code:
> 
> ```R
> # Load the data.table package
> library(data.table)
> 
> # Create a sample data.table
> DT <- data.table(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(4, 5, 6), z = c(7, 8, 9))
> 
> # Retrieve the vector from the "z" column of DT
> my_vector <- DT[, z]
> 
> # Print the resulting vector
> print(my_vector)
> ```

> In this example, we create a data.table named `DT` with three columns, and then we use the indexing operator `[, z]` to retrieve the vector from the "z" column of `DT`. The resulting vector is stored in the variable `my_vector`, which we then print to the console. You can replace "z" with the name of the column containing the numeric vector you want to retrieve.

> If the column I want to retrieve is stored in a variable, when I try this (e.g., DT[, ..col]), I get out another data.table. How do I get a numeric vector?
**assistant**:
> If the column you want to retrieve is stored in a variable and you use the `..` operator to evaluate the variable within the data.table expression, you will get back a one-column data.table instead of a numeric vector.

> # Retrieve the vector from the column stored in my_col

To retrieve the vector from the column stored in `my_col`, we use the expression `DT[, ..my_col]`, which evaluates the variable `my_col` within the data.table expression. This returns a one-column data.table, which we then pass to the `unlist()` function to convert it to a numeric vector. The resulting vector is stored in the variable `my_vector`, which we then print to the console.
