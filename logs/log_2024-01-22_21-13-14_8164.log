**user**:
> What are some other biometrics, like wasting, used to measure health consequences of malnutrition?
**assistant**:
> Malnutrition is multifaceted and can impact various aspects of health. Therefore, several biometric indicators are used to measure its health consequences. Here are some commonly used:
> 
> 1. **Underweight**: This is a measure of body mass in relation to height. Underweight is often used as an indicator of malnutrition in children under five, where a child who is two standard deviations below the mean weight-for-age ratio is considered malnourished.
> 
> 2. **Stunting**: This is a measure of a childâ€™s height in relation to age. Stunting, classified as having a height-for-age value two standard deviations below the mean, is indicative of chronic malnutrition and can impact cognitive development and overall health outcomes.
> 
> 3. **Wasting**: Represented by weight, comparing to the height (weight-for-height), and often used in emergency contexts, it is a measure of acute malnutrition. It is a sign of thinness.
> 
> 4. **Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)**: This is a simple method of assessing nutritional status by measuring the circumference of the upper arm. It's particularly useful in low-resource settings since it only requires a simple, non-stretchable band for measurement.
> 
> 5. **Edema**: This is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in body tissues, generally present on the feet and lower legs. In cases of severe acute malnutrition, nutritional edema is a common symptom.
> 
> 6. **Haemoglobin levels**: Low haemoglobin levels can indicate iron-deficiency anemia, which is often related to malnutrition.
> 
> 7. **Biochemical indicators**: Various blood tests can measure levels of vitamins, minerals, albumin, total protein, and other components to assess nutritional status.
> 
> 8. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: This metric, calculated by weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, is used for adults. A BMI less than 18.5 is usually considered underweight, indicating malnutrition.
> 
> Remember that these indicators can't always be used in isolation, as malnutrition's effects can manifest differently based on factors such as age, sex, and co-existing health conditions. A comprehensive assessment often requires using multiple biometric indicators.
