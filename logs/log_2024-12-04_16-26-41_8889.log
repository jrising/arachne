> Climate change is driving adverse impacts to human health, economies, and ecosystems, and increasing the risk of triggering climate tipping points. Tipping points modify the functioning of the Earth system, including driving new natural greenhouse gas (GHG) flows, changing global or regional temperatures and sea levels, shifting precipitation patterns, and increasing the likelihood of additional tipping points. Most importantly, tipping points undermine our ability to reduce warming, often permanently.
> 
> Climate cooling has the potential to significantly reduce global warming, providing immediate relief from climate change impacts and reducing the risk of crossing tipping point thresholds. At the same time, climate cooling can also have adverse impacts on ecosystems, change precipitation patterns, and push the climate system into a new state. Earth system changes or the risk of termination shock (the return of high temperatures if cooling activities are curtailed) may effectively make cooling decisions permanent. In this way, climate cooling action also exhibits tipping point behavior.
> 
> This project applies an economic perspective to the risks, benefits, and trade-offs associated with climate cooling activities. Both conventional climate mitigation policies and solar radiation management (SRM) activities are subject to direct and indirect costs. In both cases, there is also significant potential for learning: decarbonized energy systems are expected to become cheaper as their installed capacity increases, and unintended consequences of SRM will become less likely as the body of research increases. A long-term economic analysis can identify (1) the most promising SRM technologies, accounting for multiple forms of uncertainty, (2) the mix of research, SRM, and mitigation that maximizes society-wide benefits, and (3) the full cost of climate cooling, which depends on which regions receive benefits and bear costs.
> 
> In evaluating climate cooling practices to identify those that are feasible, scalable and safe, the benefits of avoided climate tipping points need to be set against the risk of locking in global environmental changes through the new earth-system and economic tipping points introduced by cooling practices. This project aims to evaluate the potential for SRM techniques to reduce the risk of climate tipping points, as well as to reduce the total costs and damages associated with climate change. At the same time, we will study the risks of SRM and the potential for SRM research to reduce those risks.
> 
> The central questions of this research are:
> How will near-term climate cooling reduce the risk of climate tipping points and other climate damages?
> How will near-term climate cooling increase the risk of cooling tipping points and other cooling damages?
> How should climate experimentation be planned over the medium term to maximize benefits and minimize costs?
>

> Figure 1: Direct and indirect consequences of abatement and climate cooling, corresponding to the three work packages. (1) Emissions and cooling activity both contribute to temperature, precipitation, and sea-level changes, with associated direct damages. (2) Both decarbonized energy investment and cooling activity result in non-warming impacts and changes to the likelihood of tipping points (tipping point consequences are not shown). (3) Increases in abatement and cooling technologies can reduce costs and risks, changing the demand for these actions.
> 
> 
> In the process, we will develop a generalizable benefit-cost framework to evaluate any form of SRM. This framework will also identify the greatest potential for research to reduce SRM risks and the most salient features of the spatial and social distribution of potential SRM benefits. Under this project, we will specifically evaluate stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud whitening, and identify key points where further evidence is needed and inputs necessary for the economic evaluation of other climate cooling approaches.
> 
> This project will identify types of climate cooling and investment pathways with high benefit-cost ratios, accounting for:
> Climate damages through changes to temperature, precipitation and sea-level rise, modeled at the national level;
> Cooling benefits and risks, including reduced insolation to crops and pollutant fall-out on health and ecosystems, again modeled at the national level;
> All climate tipping points currently captured with geophysical realism in the climate economics literature;
> The potential for physical tipping points associated with cooling;
> The effects of research and investment on costs and risks of cooling;
> The potential for climate cooling to reduce ambition on climate mitigation (moral hazard).
> 
> We will study scenarios that combine climate cooling with traditional climate mitigation over the next century. In calculating risks and benefits, we will account for dynamic climatic and economic uncertainty, and we will apply techniques from decision science to evaluate scenarios of mitigation and cooling.
> Methodology
> We will expand the Model for Economic Tipping point Analysis (META), an advanced social cost Integrated Assessment Model or IAM (Dietz et al. 2021), which includes eight tipping point modules with geophysically-based processes, and impact pathways that rely upon changes to CO2, CH4, albedo, sea-level rise, temperature, and precipitation. By modeling radiative forcing and surface albedo feedback directly, META can explicitly account for changes to key parameters listed in equation (9) of the funding call.
> 
> We will study climate cooling under a matrix of 30 mitigation and SRM scenarios, following MacMartin et al. (2022). These scenarios will consider all combinations of the following:
> Mitigation scenarios: CMIP6 Scenarios SSP3-7.0 (baseline), SSP2-4.5, and SSP1-2.6
> Climate cooling levels: 0° C (baseline), 0.1 °C, 0.7 °C, and 1.4 °C by 2050
> GeoMIP SRM mechanism: GeoMIP experiments G1, G4, and G4cdnc
> 
> The various climate cooling scenarios are modeled as a sigmoidal growth in cooling activity, reaching 0.1, 0.7, and 1.4 °C in 2050, approaching 1.5 °C by the end of the century (see Figure 2). These are chosen to explore a range of rates of increasing cooling activity. Total learning is cumulative while risks are based on the level of cooling, so we expect optimal cooling to grow slowly but steadily in the near term, reflected in these scenarios.
> 
> Temperature and precipitation patterns will be drawn from experiments performed by the GeoMIP project (IPCC WG1 Figure 4.3.8), which show different regional outcomes based on uniform solar reduction (G1), equator point aerosol injection (G4), and increased marine droplet concentration (G4cdnc).
> 
> Figure 2: Mitigation and cooling scenarios. SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 are shown (SSP2-4.5 not shown) including their interquartile range of warming. The three cooling scenarios are labeled based on the level of cooling in 2050.

> Work Package 1: Warming and Non-warming Costs & Benefits
> Work Package (WP) 1 will estimate the costs and benefits of climate cooling, accounting for both warming effects (e.g., reduced climate warming damages) and non-warming effects (e.g., yields impacts due to reduced insolation). A summary of these costs and benefits is provided in Table 1.

(2016); and the effects of increasing or decreasing ozone concentrations on agriculture and human health (Xia et al. 2017, WMO 2022), with impacts calibrated to Shindell et al. (2019) and Jerrett et al. (2009).

> 
> The META model will also be improved to capture the economic consequences of precipitation change. This is a key input to the damage projections produced here, but this work will be performed independently of this funding and in time for its use in this project.
> Work Package 2: Expert elicitation and tipping points
> The risk of climate cooling tipping points, and the benefits of SRM research, will be estimated using a model-augmented expert elicitation process, drawing on the interview approach used to generate the Resources for the Future Socioeconomic Projections (Rennert et al. 2022). The expert body will consist of published researchers on the climate science, climate economics, and climate engineering of SRM.

> 2.1. Design a cooling tipping point expert elicitation process drawing upon Kriegler et al. (2009). Perform iterative interviews with representative experts to refine survey questions.
> 2.2. Administer online survey to at least 50 experts (Anonymized data deliverable D5).
> Statistical identification of cooling tipping points:
> 2.3. Analyze large ensemble ESM datasets, to understand when anomalous cooling results in persistent regional or global changes.
> 2.4. Integrate expert elicitation with statistical analysis to produce refined cooling tipping point probabilities, modeled after Rennert et al. (2022) (Data deliverable D6).
> 2.5. Evaluate warming and cooling tipping point probabilities and consequences, under full range of scenarios.
> Analysis and Publication (Deliverable D7)
> 2.5. Paper on expert elicitation and economic analysis of cooling and warming tipping points.
> Work Package 3: Warming and Non-warming Costs & Benefits
> Climate cooling activities also exist within a system of economic trade-offs. SRM research will reduce both the risk of adverse tipping points and the marginal costs of climate cooling. In an economic system where climate cooling and greenhouse gas mitigation are seen as partial substitutes, this reduction in costs can result in a further increase in SRM activity and a reduction in mitigation action. This dynamic represents a kind of economic tipping point (Aldy et al. 2021). We will use a model of forward-looking optimization under uncertainty to estimate the optimal mix of subsides and research into emissions reduction and climate cooling.
> 
> WP 3 will address the question, how should research, SRM action, and mitigation be planned, under forward-looking optimization over uncertainty. This involves solving a dynamic, cost-minimization problem, with climate and SRM damages, mitigation and SRM implementation costs, using dynamic programming. The recursive value function (the Bellman equation) is of the form
> V(ClimateState, CarbonIntensity, SRMLearning) =
>  greenInvest, srmActionDamages(ClimateState, srmAction, CarbonIntensity) + 
> Costs(greenInvest, CarbonIntensity, srmAction) +
> V(f(ClimateState, CarbonIntensity, SRMLearning, srmAction),
> CarbonIntensity - greenInvest, SRMLearning + srmAction))
> The functions ClimateStatet+1=f(ClimateStatet, CarbonIntensity, SRMLearning, srmAction) will be calibrated to the META model and new work on the learning rate of SRM research. The learning rate is nonlinear in the level of reduction (Kelly et al. 2024), and we will account for this in our estimates of SRM research benefits.
> 
> 
> Tasks: Dynamic programming-based policy:

> 3.5. Paper on optimal mixes of research, mitigation, and cooling policies.
> 2. The Team
> The project team consists of the co-developers of the META model (Rising, Dietz, and Stoerk), with expertise across tipping points, modeling, and climate economics, in collaboration with a leading climate systems engineering expert (Keith).
> 
> James Rising (University of Delaware) is a climate economist who studies feedbacks and decision-making in human-environmental systems under uncertainty. Rising has studied the risks of climate change in the UK (Rising et al. 2022a) and abroad (Rising et al. 2022b).
> Rising will coordinate the project, and lead scenario development, expert elicitation, and tipping point analyses (WP 2).
> 
> Simon Dietz (London School of Economics) is a climate economist with expertise in integrated assessment modeling of the climate-economy system. He ran the economic models for the 2006 Stern Review (Stern, 2006) and has been at the forefront of the field since. Dietz will lead the forward-looking optimization analysis (WP 3), contribute to the expert elicitation and lead on incorporating climate cooling into the META model.
> 
> Thomas Stoerk (National Bank of Belgium and London School of Economics) is a climate economist with expertise in using climate-economy integrated assessment models to inform policy-making. Stoerk contributed climate science and climate economics expertise for the modeling which led to the European Union's adopting climate neutrality as its 2050 target (European Commission, 2018) and has used integrated assessment models to explore trade-offs in mitigation choices across different greenhouse gases (Stoerk et al., In preparation).Stoerk will lead the evaluation of indirect cooling risks and their incorporation into the META model (WP 1).
> 
> David Keith (University of Chicago) is a geophysicist, an expert in solar geoengineering, and the founding faculty director of the Climate Systems Engineering initiative at the University of Chicago. Keith has extensively researched the costs (McClellan et al. 2012), benefits (MacMartin et al. 2018), and trade-offs (Moreno-Cruz & Keith 2013) associated with SRM and geoengineering research. Keith will contribute to scenario development, expert elicitation, and SRM costs and benefits (WP 1-2).
> 
> This team is uniquely qualified to perform an innovative economic analysis of tipping points. The META model provides unprecedented integration of tipping-point dynamics within the climate economics literature, along with features at the frontier of IAMs, including incorporating state-of-the-art climate science, and simulating national-level, empirically-based damages from rising temperatures, sea-level rise damages and coastal adaptation. The other core methodologies are also well-represented across the team. In particular, Rising and Dietz have been engaged in recent expert elicitation research and in recursive dynamic modeling of climate-economy interactions, while Stoerk has led European Commission work on estimating non-warming air quality impacts in climate policy scenarios. Keith is perhaps the leading expert in solar geoengineering.
> 
> The project also benefits from ongoing, separately-funded work. Rising will also incorporate fully-updated national mitigation costs developed for the Policy Analysis of Greenhouse Effect (PAGE) model; Dietz has planned work to expand the META damage function to account for precipitation effects that are key inputs to this analysis; and Rising and Dietz are involved in calibrating PM2.5 and ozone damages to agriculture and human health to be used for indirect cost estimates as part of the new UNEP/CCAC Economic Assessment of Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (of which Dietz is Co-Chair).
> 
> The project will be managed around a detailed timeline of deliverables (described above), ensuring that necessary inputs will be ready in a timely fashion. Each work package lead, all of which are available immediately, will act as project manager for their work package. Three in-person meets will be scheduled, at the University of Delaware (kick-off meeting), University of Chicago (after 8 months), and London School of Economics (after 16 months).

> The BACCARAT project (Benefits And Costs of Cooling Accounting for Risks And Tipping Points) seeks to evaluate the complex trade-offs associated with climate cooling technologies, particularly Solar Radiation Management (SRM), from an economic perspective. As climate change escalates the threat of crossing irreversible climate tipping points, this project focuses on understanding how near-term cooling efforts can mitigate or exacerbate these risks. By expanding the Model for Economic Tipping point Analysis (META), an advanced Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), we will investigate the feasibility, scalability, and safety of SRM techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud whitening.
> 
> Our research will identify the most promising SRM technologies and optimal mix of climate interventions by assessing their economic, environmental, and societal costs and benefits. This includes a comprehensive analysis of potential risks, such as new cooling tipping points, and the impact of climate cooling on global environmental changes. We aim to provide a generalizable benefit-cost framework for evaluating SRM, shedding light on opportunities for research to mitigate its risks.
> 
> The project will address key questions such as: how climate cooling can alter the likelihood and impacts of tipping points, and how policies should be designed to optimize benefits while minimizing costs. Our team comprises leading experts in climate economics and geoengineering, who will apply decision science and forward-looking optimization to create actionable insights for integrating SRM within broader climate strategies. Outputs will include new economic models and open-access data, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions on climate interventions.
