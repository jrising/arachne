> 
> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."

> Second, here is a peer's statement for comparison:

> Since my appointment at UC Davis I have taught 5 different courses, of which 3 are completely new classes developed by myself (or in one case with a co-instructor) and one of which I substantially overhauled when I began teaching. My classes mostly focus on teaching environmental policy evaluation, including principles of economic analysis, to undergraduate and graduate students without economics backgrounds (ESP 168a, taught 5 times; ENV 200b, taught twice). Making this technical material accessible and relevant to all students is a pedagogical challenge. My teaching philosophy focuses on developing general quntitative skills and on demonstrating the application of the material through applied examples.
> My largest class is ESP 168a: Methods of Environmental Policy Evaluation (5 units), which I have taught 5 times with enrollment varying between 90 and 120 students. The course is required in our Environmental Policy Analysis and Planning major and minor and covers methods relevant to the analysis of environmental policy. I fully revised the curriculum for this class, producing new lectures, problem sets, and in-class case studies. The problem sets help students develop skills in modeling, data analysis, and data visualization. Case-studies apply material learned in class to real-world regulatory analysis problems (such as lifecycle greenhouse gas impacts of the Renewable Fuel Standard). Student evaluations have been consistently positive, with recent class and instructor ratings ranging between 4.3 and 4.8 out of 5 (including one quarter taught online via Zoom due to the COVID 19 pandemic).
> Jointly with Professor Robert Hijmans, I have developed a new undergraduate class - ESP 106: Introduction to Environmental Data Science (3 units), which will be a core class in a new Environmental Data Science track in the Environmental Science and Management major. The goal of this class is to equip students interested in environmental science and policy with a foundation in programming and data analysis they can build on in their studies and future careers. Comfort with quantitative data analysis is increasingly important in many environmental careers but modern data analysis tools have a high barrier to entry. The class teaches students with no prior background the fundamentals of programming in R, good coding practices, principles of data analysis and visualization, and introduces spatial data analysis. The class was taught for the first time in 2021 and received excellent class (4.2) and instructor scores (4.7), particularly given the challenges of teaching coding remotely.
> My graduate teaching is in the Environmental Policy and Management (EPM) masters program. I developed a new core class for that program, ENV 203: Environmental Policy Clinic, which I taught twice. This class is a capstone experience for the EPM students, based on the law school clinic model, and involves a six month group project working with an external partner. The standard of projects has been high, with both students and client organizations expressing satisfaction with the model. I have twice taught the core environmental economics class in that program (ENV 200b: Environmental Policy Evaluation) which covers principles of economic analysis, market failures, and policy instrument design for professional masters students. I also provide guest lectures to graduate courses in Ecology and Agriculture and Resource Economics.
> I am affiliated with five graduate groups  (Agriculture and Resource Economics, Energy Systems, Geography, Ecology, and EPM) and as a result work with graduate students from a range of disciplines. I have worked closely with three PhD students. Two were in the Agriculture and Resource Economics graduate group and graduated in 2020. Of these I was co-chair of the dissertation committee for one (Matthew Gammans) and a committee member for another (Jesus Gonzalez). I am sole advisor for Bernie Bastien who is completing his 4th year in the Geography Graduate Group and is on track to graduate next year. Both Jesus and Bernie have published papers overseen and guided by myself that have appeared in highly respected journals (Nature Sustainability, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, and Environmental Research Letters). I have also advised undergraduate research. Arianna Stokes completed her undergraduate thesis under my supervision and is currently second author on a paper in revision for the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economics (8). I have advised 9 professional masters students in the EPM program, of whom 5 have graduated.
> I have participated in 8 qualifying exams for four graduate groups within UC Davis (Agriculture and Resource Economics, Geography, Transportation Technology and Policy, and Energy), and was an external member for a qualifying exam at Dartmouth University.

> Throughout my career, I have regularly coordinated workshops, conference sessions, and speaker series.
> I co-organized my department's speaker series at both LSE and UD and the public event series at LSE. In one year each, I led the organization of a global PhD workshop (the Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop in Sustainable Development) and small conference (the Sustainable Development Research Conference), and I helped create the Alliance Science and Policy Summer School. I have chaired multiple conference sessions in climate change, hydrology, and just transitions.

> impacts'', paired with a New York Times article by Naomi Oreskes and
> Nicholas Stern. It then formed the basis for a 50-person, facilitated international expert workshop funded by the UK Department
> for Business, Energy \& Industrial Strategy, which I spearheaded\footnote{July 2020, ``Strengthening Understanding of the Economic Impacts of Climate Change''}. The event won the new Action 2030 Award from Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) and resulted in a review paper \cite{rising2022challenges}.  I recently continued this work by helping organize a meeting convened by the Royal Society in London\footnote{March 2023, ``New horizons for understanding of the economic consequences of climate change'',} and speaking on a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences\footnote{June 2023, ``Workshop on Macroeconomics and Climate-related Risks and Opportunities''}.
> 
> These workshops have also led to my engagement in other international  policy discussions.
> I have participated in the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) as a U.S. nominated expert. A collaboration initiated at the IPBES workshop on modelling Nature Futures scenarios resulted in a recent paper\cite{kramer2023new}. I am part of a new Climate Change Committee Advisory Group on the economics of climate adaptation and resilience.
> 
> I have also played an active role in the organization of my institutions. I headed an initiative to make the GRI carbon neutral, working with LSE's sustainability office and coordinating across multiple working groups on air travel, offsetting,
> behavior change, and other aspects of the transition process. I also helped organize an international research network around just transitions.
> At UD, I helped develop new Masters programs in Environmental Economics (within my department) and Environmental Science \& Management (across my college), and a new PhD program in Environmental Economics.
> 
> I am an active reviewer, reviewing 48 manuscripts, including articles at {\it Nature}, {\it Nature Climate Change}, {\it Science}, {\it Environmental Resource Letters}, the {\it Journal of Environmental Economics and Management}, and {\it Journal of Econometrics}. I have also been involved in reviews of major reports, IPCC chapter drafts, and grant proposal review processes, including a multi-stage process for EU HORIZON grants.
> 
> My research has been used in several public-facing outlets. As part of the Climate Impact Lab, I have contributed to interactive stories for the New York Times (e.g., \href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/climate/how-much-hotter-is-your-hometown.html}{How Much Hotter Is Your Hometown Than When You Were Born?}) and the UN Development Programme (\href{https://horizons.hdr.undp.org/}{Human Climate Horizons}). Individually, I have supported, through advice and analysis the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), US EPA's Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis (CIRA), and the EPA's work on Social Cost of Carbon.
