> How does async function work in javascript?
**assistant**:
> An asynchronous function in JavaScript is a function that is defined with the `async` keyword, and the main characteristic of an asynchronous function is that it allows you to wait for a Promise to resolve or reject. This can be done using the `await` keyword within the asynchronous function.
> 
> A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It is used for handling asynchronous computations which can be in one of the following states: `fulfilled`, `rejected`, or `pending`.
> 
> Here's a simplified overview of how an async function works:
> 
> 1. **Declare an async function.** You declare an async function with the keyword `async` before the function name (or before parentheses for an anonymous function).
> ```javascript
> async function myFunc() {...}
> // or
> const myFunc = async () => {...};
> ```
> 
> 2. **Promises.** Every asynchronous function returns a `Promise`. If the code within the function throws an error, the Promise is rejected. If the function completes without any issues, the Promise is resolved.
> ```javascript
> async function myFunc() { return "Hello!"; }    
> myFunc().then(alert); // This will alert "Hello!"
> ```
> 
> 3. **Awaiting results.** The `await` keyword can only be used within an async function and allows the function to pause and wait for a Promise's resolution or rejection before the function continues execution.
> ```javascript
> async function myFunc() {
>   let value = await fetch('http://example.com'); // Fetch API returns a promise
>   return value; // when the promise resolves, we can return the value
> }
> ```
> In the above example, `fetch` is a web API that returns a Promise. The `myFunc` function pauses at the `fetch` statement until the promise settles, then resumes with the result of that promise.
> 
> The main benefit to this style of asynchronous code is that it makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code. This leads to more readable and maintainable code. However, it's important to note that despite the appearances, the code is still non-blocking and asynchronous.
