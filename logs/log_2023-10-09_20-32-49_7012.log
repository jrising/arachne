> It appears that recent rebuilding efforts, although successful in reducing exploitation rates in several ecosystems (Fig. 3A), have not yet reversed a general trend of increasing depletion of individual stocks (Fig. 4M). This matches the model-derived prediction that reduction of exploitation rate to the level that produces MMSY will still keep a number of vulnerable species collapsed (Fig. 2). Rebuilding these collapsed stocks may require trading off short-term yields for conservation benefits or, alternatively, more selective targeting of species that can sustain current levels of fishing pressure while protecting others from overexploitation.
> Small-scale fisheries. Fish or invertebrate stocks that are scientifically assessed (n = 177 in our analysis) or appear in research trawl surveys (n = 1309 taxa-by-survey combinations in fig. S2) constitute only a fraction of fisheries worldwide, which is an important caveat to the above discussion. Moreover they represent a nonrandom sample dominated by valuable industrial fisheries with some form of management in developed countries. The information on other fisheries, particularly small-scale artisanal and recreational fisheries is scarcer, less accessible, and more difficult to interpret. This is because small-scale fisheries are harder to track, with 12 million fishers compared with 0.5 million in industrialized fisheries (25), and assessments or survey data are often lacking. Small-scale fisheries catches are also poorly reported; the best global estimate is about 21 million tons in 2000 (25). Conventional management tools used for industrial fisheries are generally unenforceable in small-scale fisheries when implemented in a top-down manner. More successful forms of governance have involved local communities in a co-management arrangement with government or nongovernmental organizations (26). An example is the rebuilding of depleted fish stocks on Kenyan coral reefs (Fig. 5A). A network of closed areas and the exclusion of highly unselective beach seines were implemented in cooperation with local communities and led to a recovery of the biomass and size of available fish (27). This translated into steep increases in fishers’ incomes, particularly in regions that had both closed areas and gear restrictions in place (Fig. 5A). Other examples of successful rebuilding come from Latin America, particularly Chile and Mexico, where open-access fisheries for valuable invertebrates were transformed by the establishment of spatial management units that had exclusive access by local fishing organizations (26). Despite these successes, rebuilding small-scale fisheries remains a significant challenge in developing countries where most fishers do not have access to alternative sources of food, income, and employment.

> Tools for rebuilding. Management actions in a few ecosystems have prevented overfishing or, more commonly, reduced exploitation rates after a period of overfishing (Figs. 3 to 5). Diverse management tools have helped to achieve reductions in exploitation rates (Table 1). The most commonly used tools overall are gear restrictions, closed areas, and a reduction of fishing capacity, followed by reductions in total allowable catch and catch shares. Reductions in fishing capacity and allowable catch directly reduce the exploitation rate of target species by limiting catches. Gear modifications may be used to increase selectivity and reduce by-catch of nontarget species. Closed areas are either fully protected marine reserves (as in the Kenyan example discussed above) or are designed to exclude specific fisheries from certain areas. They can initiate recovery by providing refuge for overfished stocks (21, 28), restoring community structure (22) and biodiversity (3), protecting important habitat features, and increasing ecosystem resilience (29). Assigning dedicated access privileges, such as catch shares or territorial fishing rights, to individual fishers or fishing communities has often provided economic incentives to reduce effort and exploitation rate (30) and may also improve compliance and participation in the management process (31). Likewise, the certification of sustainable fisheries is increasingly used as an incentive for improved management practices. Realigning economic incentives with resource conservation (rather than overexploitation) is increasingly recognized as a critical component of successful rebuilding efforts (8).

Symbols indicate the contributions of a range of management tools to achieving reductions in exploitation rate: + tool contributed, ++ an important tool, or +++ an essential tool. Note that these examples are for industrialized fisheries, except Kenya, Chile, and Mexico. Ratings were supplied and checked by local experts.
> We emphasize that the feasibility and value of different management tools depends heavily on local characteristics of the fisheries, ecosystem, and governance system. For example, the most important element of small-scale fisheries success has been community-based management (Table 1), in which local communities develop context-dependent solutions for matching exploitation rates to the productivity of local resources (26). A combination of diverse tools, such as catch restrictions, gear modifications, and closed areas, is typically required to meet both fisheries and conservation objectives.
> Here we have only identified the proximate tools, not the ultimate socioeconomic drivers that have enabled some regions to prevent or reduce overfishing while others remained overexploited. Yet it is generally evident that good local governance, enforcement, and compliance form the very basis for conservation and rebuilding efforts (32). Legislation that makes overexploitation illegal and specifies unambiguous control rules and rebuilding targets has also been critically important, for example, in the United States (8, 28).
> Most rebuilding efforts only begin after there is drastic and undeniable evidence of overexploitation. The inherent uncertainty in fisheries, however, requires that agencies act before it comes to that stage (33); this is especially true in light of accelerating global change (34). We found that only Alaska and New Zealand seemed to have acted with such foresight, whereas other regions experienced systemic overexploitation. The data that we have compiled cannot resolve why inherently complex fish-fisher-management systems (35) behaved differently in these cases; possible factors are a combination of abundant resources and low human population, slow development of domestic fisheries, and little interference from international fleets. It would be an important next step to dissect the underlying socioeconomic and ecological variables that enabled some regions to conserve, restore, and rebuild marine resources.
> Problems for rebuilding. Despite local successes, it has also become evident that rebuilding efforts can encounter significant problems and short-term costs. On a regional scale, the reduction of quotas, fishing effort, and overcapacity eliminates jobs, at least in the short term. Initial losses may create strong resistance from fisheries-dependent communities through the political process. For instance in the United States, where 67 overfished stocks have rebuilding plans, 45% of those were still being overfished in 2006, whereas only 3 stocks had been rebuilt at that time (36). This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the recovery of depleted stocks can take years or even decades (28, 37), and during this time catches may be dramatically reduced (e.g., Fig. 4L). Furthermore, government subsidies often promote overfishing and overcapacity and need to be reduced against the interests of those who receive them (38). Lastly, there is the problem of unreported and illegal fishing, which can seriously undermine rebuilding efforts (11). Illegal and unreported catches vary between regions, ranging between an estimated 3% of total catch in the Northeast Pacific to 37% in the East Central Atlantic, with a global average of 18% in 2000–2003 (11).
> On a global scale, a key problem for rebuilding is the movement of fishing effort from industrialized countries to the developing world (Fig. 5B). This north-south redistribution of fisheries has been accelerating since the 1960s (39) and could in part be a perverse side effect of efforts to restore depleted fisheries in the developed world, as some fishing effort is displaced to countries with weaker laws and enforcement capacity. The situation is particularly well documented for West Africa (39) and more recently East Africa, where local fisheries have seen increasing competition from foreign fleets operating under national access agreements (Fig. 5B) and where illegal and unreported catches are higher than anywhere else (11). Almost all of the fish caught by foreign fleets is consumed in industrialized countries and may threaten regional food security (39) and biodiversity (40) in the developing world. Clearly, more global oversight is needed to ensure that rebuilding efforts in some regions do not cause problems elsewhere. For example, fishing vessels removed in effort-reduction schemes would ideally be prohibited from migrating to other regions and exacerbating existing problems with overcapacity and overexploitation.
> Open questions. Rebuilding efforts raise a number of scientific questions. Recovery of depleted stocks is still a poorly understood process, particularly for demersal species (37). It is potentially constrained by the magnitude of previous decline (37), the loss of biodiversity (3, 23), species life histories (37), species interactions (17, 18, 20), and climate (28, 34). Yet, many examples of recovery exist, both in protected areas (3, 21, 22) and in large-scale ecosystems where exploitation was substantially reduced (Fig. 3A). A better understanding of how to predict and better manage for recovery will require insight into the resilience and productivity of individual populations and their communities. This could be gained by more widespread spatial experimentation, involving proper controls, good monitoring, and adaptive management. Some of the most spectacular rebuilding efforts, such as those undertaken in California (41), the northeast United States (21), and northwest Australia (42), have involved bold experimentation with closed areas, gear and effort restrictions, and new approaches to catch allocation and enforcement. Science has a key role to play in guiding such policies, analyzing the effects of changes in management and advancing toward more general rules for rebuilding.
> A second area of inquiry relates to the question of how to avoid contentious trade-offs between allowable catch and the conservation of vulnerable or collapsed species. Recovering these species while maintaining global catches may be possible through improved gear technology and a much more widespread use of ocean zoning into areas that are managed for fisheries benefits and others managed for species and habitat conservation. Designing appropriate incentives for fishers to avoid the catch of threatened species, for example, through tradable catch and by-catch quotas, has yielded good results in some regions (16). Temporary area closures can also be effective but require detailed mapping of the distribution of depleted populations and their habitats.
> Conclusions. Marine ecosystems are currently subjected to a range of exploitation rates, resulting in a mosaic of stable, declining, collapsed, and rebuilding fish stocks and ecosystems. Management actions have achieved measurable reductions in exploitation rates in some regions, but a significant fraction of stocks will remain collapsed unless there are further reductions in exploitation rates. Unfortunately, effective controls on exploitation rates are still lacking in vast areas of the ocean, including those beyond national jurisdiction (6, 8, 32). Ecosystems examined in this paper account for less than a quarter of world fisheries area and catch, and lightly to moderately fished and rebuilding ecosystems (green and yellow areas in Fig. 1B) comprise less than half of those. They may best be interpreted as large-scale restoration experiments that demonstrate opportunities for successfully rebuilding marine resources elsewhere. Similar trajectories of recovery have been documented in protected areas around the world (3, 21, 22), which currently cover less than 1% of ocean area. Taken together, these examples provide hope that despite a long history of overexploitation (1, 2) marine ecosystems can still recover if exploitation rates are reduced substantially. In fisheries science, there is a growing consensus that the exploitation rate that achieves maximum sustainable yield (uMSY) should be reinterpreted as an upper limit rather than a management target. This requires overall reductions in exploitation rates, which can be achieved through a range of management tools. Finding the best management tools may depend on the local context. Most often, it appears that a combination of traditional approaches (catch quotas, community management) coupled with strategically placed fishing closures, more selective fishing gear, ocean zoning, and economic incentives holds much promise for restoring marine fisheries and ecosystems. Within science, a new cooperation of fisheries scientists and conservation biologists sharing the best available data, and bridging disciplinary divisions, will help to inform and improve ecosystem management. We envision a seascape where the rebuilding, conservation, and sustainable use of marine resources become unifying themes for science, management, and society. We caution that the road to recovery is not always simple and not without short-term costs. Yet, it remains our only option for insuring fisheries and marine ecosystems against further depletion and collapse.

**assistant**:
> This section discusses the outcomes of recent rebuilding efforts in fisheries and the challenges associated with reversing the depletion of individual stocks. While some ecosystems have seen reductions in exploitation rates, there is a continued trend of stock depletion overall. This aligns with model predictions that reducing exploitation rates alone may not be sufficient to restore collapsed stocks. To rebuild these stocks, there needs to be a trade-off between short-term yields and conservation measures or more selective targeting of species to protect them from overexploitation.
> 
> The section also highlights the limitations of the analysis, as it focuses on scientifically assessed and researched fisheries, which represent only a fraction of global fisheries. The information and data on small-scale fisheries, particularly artisanal and recreational fisheries, are scarce and more challenging to interpret. Effective management tools used in industrialized fisheries may not be enforceable in small-scale fisheries, and successful governance often involves co-management with local communities. Examples of successful rebuilding efforts are discussed, such as the implementation of closed areas and gear restrictions in Kenyan coral reefs, leading to the recovery of fish biomass, increased fishers' incomes, and similar efforts in Chile and Mexico.

> Various management tools for rebuilding fisheries are identified, including gear restrictions, closed areas, reductions in fishing capacity, total allowable catch, catch shares, fisheries certification, and community co-management. The feasibility and effectiveness of these tools depend on local characteristics of the fisheries, ecosystem, and governance system. The importance of local governance, enforcement, and compliance for conservation and rebuilding efforts is emphasized.
> 
> The section also highlights the challenges and costs associated with rebuilding efforts, such as resistance from fisheries-dependent communities, job losses, government subsidies promoting overfishing, and the problem of unreported and illegal fishing. It discusses the global scale problem of fishing effort shifting from industrialized countries to developing countries, leading to potential overcapacity and overexploitation in the latter. The section concludes by posing open questions for further scientific inquiry, including the recovery of depleted stocks, avoiding trade-offs between catch and conservation of vulnerable species, and the need for better global oversight. The importance of reducing exploitation rates and the potential of various management tools for rebuilding marine fisheries and ecosystems are underscored, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and cooperation between fisheries scientists and conservation biologists. The ultimate goal is to ensure the sustainability and conservation of marine resources against further depletion and collapse.
