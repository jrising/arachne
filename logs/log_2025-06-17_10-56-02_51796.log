> I would like to tighten up a project proposal document-- currently 4 pages into 2 pages. The first section though just dives into the work and I want to add more introduction. Here's how it starts:
> ===
> The following projects apply quantitative analysis, meta-analysis, and economic modeling to assess the consequences of the large-scale deployment of fluoropolymer-based hydrogen technology. The work is organized around two central concerns. First, the work focuses on vulnerable communities, including Justice40 disadvantaged communities (DACs) and workers in the fossil fuel and hydrogen economies. Second, we aim to develop comprehensive cost-benefit analyses for the use of these technologies, accounting for their both their economic and environmental consequences and potential.
> 
> The project work streams are interconnected, and collectively provide the necessary details to quantify cost and benefits of the hydrogen technology and to support adversely impacted groups.
> 
> The research would be disseminated as both public-facing policy reports and academic publications. It will form the foundation of a student’s Ph.D. dissertation in Environmental Economics.
> 
> Scope of the evaluation:
> We will develop spatial and demographic group assessments of the following cost-benefit factors across the United States:
> -	Short and long-term health consequences of increased fluoropolymer exposure.
> -	Short and long-term health and economic benefits from reduced climate change and associated mitigation costs.
> -	Environmental and ecological consequences of fluoropolymer pollution.
> -	Economic consequences involved in worker transitions under the hydrogen economy.
> 
> For each of these four sections, we will ground the analysis in a comprehensive literature review. Where possible, key parameters assessed under multiple contexts and for multiple PFAS polymers (e.g., birthweight impacts) will be meta-analyzed to develop a best-estimate understanding of the impacts, accounting for the particularities of PFAS-based membranes under large-scale deployment.

> **Introduction:**
> 
> In recent years, the hydrogen economy has emerged as a pivotal component of the global transition towards sustainable energy systems. Hydrogen, often touted as a clean energy carrier, can be produced with zero carbon emissions, making it a promising solution for reducing global reliance on fossil fuels. This shift is driven by the growing necessity to mitigate climate change impacts and transition to renewable energy sources. Fluoropolymer-based hydrogen technologies, specifically, have been gaining attention due to their potential efficiency in large-scale applications.
> 
> The development of the hydrogen economy is not without its challenges. It requires significant infrastructure changes, technological innovation, and careful consideration of environmental and social impacts. Economic modeling is crucial to assess the viability and implications of these technologies, particularly their effects on vulnerable communities and the environment.
> 
> **Summary of Proposal:**
> 
> This project employs quantitative analysis, meta-analysis, and economic modeling to evaluate the consequences of deploying fluoropolymer-based hydrogen technologies. Focused on vulnerable communities, such as Justice40 disadvantaged groups and workers in both the fossil fuel and hydrogen sectors, the project aims to provide comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider economic, environmental, and social impacts.
> 
> Organized around four main work streams, the evaluation encompasses:
> 
> - **Health Consequences:** Assessing both short and long-term health impacts of increased fluoropolymer exposure.
> - **Climate Benefits:** Evaluating the health and economic benefits of reduced climate impacts and mitigation costs.
> - **Environmental Impact:** Investigating the ecological effects of fluoropolymer pollution.
> - **Economic Shifts:** Analyzing economic effects related to worker transitions within the hydrogen economy.
> 
> The work's foundation lies in extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses to refine and support key parameters pertinent to PFAS-based membranes. Results will be shared through public policy reports and academic publications, contributing to a Ph.D. dissertation in Environmental Economics.
> 
> By offering detailed evaluations and supporting vulnerable communities, this project seeks to guide equitable and sustainable hydrogen technology deployment across the United States.
**user**:
> This is great. the rest of the proposal is organized into work packages. Here it is:
> ===
> WP1. Scenario development and stakeholder engagement.
> The work of this community benefits plan will require a quantitative scenario for the large-scale deployment hydrogen technologies. We will co-design this scenario in consultation with both industry stakeholders and DACs. The scenario will extend to 2100 and include features of the changing climate, macroeconomy, and labor market. Also under WP1, we will perform an economic field experiment to understand how members of DACs perceive the trade-offs captured in the cost-benefit analysis. This will provide crucial information used to translate between impacts and losses to comprehensive welfare.
> 
> Methodology: An advisory committee consisting of representatives from the chemical and energy industries, policymakers, and community groups will be formed. This group will review research plans and results throughout the project and be involved in the scenario co-development. The scenario development will begin with moderated focus group discussions on key features and appropriate assumptions for the transition to a hydrogen economy. After these, the research team will iteratively engage with the advisory group to refine the scenario. The economic field experiment will as members of DACs a series of qualitative and quantitative questions to assess their response to different forms of risk and their valuation of the issues involved in the cost-benefit analysis.
> 
> Community Benefits: The involvement of the advisory board will both improve the salience of research results, and support in their dissemination. In addition to their use in this project, the scenario and economic experiment results will be of broader relevance to future research on the impacts of the hydrogen economy.
> 
> WP2. Health and ecological consequences.
> Multiple sources have reviewed the environmental and economic impacts of PFAS (Goldenman  et al. 2019, Ng  et al. 2021, Kempisty & Racz 2021). This research aims to develop a targeted synthesis of this material, as it pertains to DACs. We will develop a quantitative understanding of the differences between estimates of health and ecological outcomes, as they are affected by both the features of the PFAS chemicals and the environment and demographic characteristics.
> 
> Methodology: For health outcomes, we will draw from Kirk et al. 2018, adding additional information on demographic and PFAS characteristics. This information will then be used to calibrate a random forest model, which will generate estimated parameters specific to DACs and PFAS-based membranes. Projected results under the WP1 scenario will use these parameters, following the methodology in WP3. Ecological outcomes will be similarly estimated, drawing on papers in the Klingelhöfer et al. (2024) review.
> 
> Community Benefits: The fitted random forest models will provide crucial new information specific to DACs for a range of PFAS chemicals.
> 
> WP3. Climate costs and mitigation benefits.
> A moderate-sized shift to a hydrogen economy will also produce benefits through its effects on local and global climate. This project will focus on the health outcomes of these changes in the US. Hydrogen systems will reduce pollution, producing health benefits from reduced ozone and PM2.5. They will also reduce total greenhouse gas emissions, relative to existing energy systems, producing benefits from lower temperatures. These benefits will be identified geographically as well as across income groups.
> 
> Methodology: Local health benefits of reduced ozone and PM2.5 will be evaluated using AIM, GAINS, LEAP-IBC, and the US EPA’s BenMAP. Global health benefits, as moderated by the climate system, will be evaluated using the Carleton et al. (2022), using MimiFAIRv2 to model the global climate system. The combined welfare outcomes will be evaluated by region using VSL, and combined according to standard social welfare functions. WP3 will also draw upon the demographic analysis performed under WP4.
> 
> Community Benefits: This project fits into the proposal’s goals for Energy Equity. By focusing on the local and global benefits of hydrogen technology, it assesses the environmental justice implications of the hydrogen economy. Furthermore, linking these benefits to health outcomes provides a tangible connection between the projects Chemours is proposing and their potential impact on disadvantaged communities.
> 
> WP4. Worker transition
> A shift to a hydrogen economy could have significant impacts on equity and vulnerable households in the US, as the clean and fossil fuel sectors readjust. This WP will evaluate directly and indirectly affected workers and jobs. The justice outcomes for workers will depend upon the ease of transitioning to related jobs in the new economy. This project will study shifting skills needed and quantify welfare outcomes across income groups.
> 
> Methodology: Economic consequences under the scenario developed in WP1 will be translated to impacts on workers and households using the Consumer Expenditure Surveys and March Current Population Survey Income Supplement. Affected jobs and the potential for transferability between jobs will be identified using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) skills mapping. We will specifically use the green and non-green mapping constructed by Consoli et al. (2016).
> 
> Community Benefits: This project aligns well with Chemours’ DEIA and Workforce goals, as it promotes diverse career pathways into a hydrogen economy. By identifying those affected and helping to support their transition, it underscores the importance of diversity and inclusion in this future economy. Evaluating economic adjustments by income group reflects a commitment to equity. Additionally, it provides key insights that can be used to guide diversifying procurement opportunities, potentially offering benefits to minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses mentioned under the IDE&A in Procurement section.
