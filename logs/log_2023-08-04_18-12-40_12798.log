> I am using the Zotero plugin to manage a bibliography in Google Docs. I want some of my citations to come in as non-parentheticals (the equivalent of \citet in natbib). How can I achieve this?
**assistant**:
> Unfortunately, as of my last update (August 2023), the Zotero Google Docs integration plugin does not support non-parenthetical (or textual) citations natively, similar to `\citet` command in natbib. Zotero for Google Docs integration predominantly supports parenthetical or footnote citations.
> 
> However, you have two workaround options:
> 
> 1. ***Customize After Inserting***: Insert the citation as usual using Zotero, and then manually change the format. For example, if Zotero inserts `(Rising, 2023)`, you can manually change it to `Rising (2023)`. Note: Any changes you make will be lost if you refresh the document's Zotero citations, as Zotero will revert them to the original format.
> 
> 2. ***Use a Different Citation Manager that Supports Non-parenthetical Citations***: Other citation manager tools like Mendeley have more options for citation styles, and may support non-parenthetical citations (But always make sure that the tool you choose matches your other needs).
> 
> Please keep in mind that the most appropriate solution depends on your personal needs, such as the size of your document, the number of non-parenthetical citations, and how often you will be refreshing them. 
> 
> Looking towards the future, you might benefit from requesting this feature be added to Zotero's roadmap. Considering Zotero's active user and developer community, it's entirely possible they might take your suggestion into account!
**user**:
> Can I create a "hidden" citation, so I can write the citation as I want and through the hidden citation make sure it ends up in the bibliography?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can create a "hidden" citation in Zotero to ensure that it appears in the bibliography without being visible in the main text. This method allows you to manually write the citation as you want, while still maintaining its inclusion in the bibliography when you refresh or update it.
> 
> Here's how you can create a hidden citation in Zotero:
> 
> 1. Insert a citation at the desired location in your document using Zotero. This will create a visible citation placeholder in the text.
> 
> 2. After inserting the citation, select the citation placeholder in the document.
> 
> 3. Modify the formatting of the citation placeholder to make it "hidden" or inconspicuous. You can change the font color to match the background color or reduce the font size to make it less noticeable. The goal is to make the citation invisible in the final document.
> 
> 4. Refresh or update the bibliography in your document using the Zotero plugin. The hidden citation will be included in the bibliography, even though it is not visible in the main text.
> 
> By following these steps, you can customize the appearance of the citation in the text while ensuring its presence in the bibliography. Just note that if you refresh the citation, any formatting changes you made may be overridden, so you may need to reapply them.
> 
> Remember to carefully review the final document to ensure the hidden citation is functioning as intended and that it appears correctly in the bibliography.
