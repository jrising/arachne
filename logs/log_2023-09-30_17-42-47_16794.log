> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters.
> The following is an outline of the organization of the report. Can you expand this as prose?
> This report is organized into the following sections:
> Current Activities: Major activities currently practiced in Delaware’s waters.
> Planned Future Activities: New activities and changes currently being developed.
> Potential Future Activities: Activities occurring elsewhere that could be done in Delaware.
> Non-Activity Planning Features: Spatial features that inform activities.
> Interactions: Discussion of the interactions between different activity types.

**assistant**:
> Of course, James, here's your outline expanded into a prose format for your report on the current and potential activities in Delaware's marine waters. 
>

> 
> This report is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the many activities, both current and prospective, taking place in Delaware's marine waters. It aims to shed light on the spatial planning practices and features that underpin these activities, and explore their implications for future work. The structure of the report is organized into several key sections.
> 
> In the 'Current Activities' section, the report delves into the major activities currently taking place in Delaware’s waters. A wide range of practices from aquaculture and fishing to recreational boating and commercial shipping are examined, providing a detailed snapshot of the region's bustling marine activity scene.
> 
> 'Planned Future Activities' is the succeeding section. Here our attention shifts to initiatives and changes currently under development. Expansions of existing operations, establishment of new ventures, and initiatives aimed at bolstering sustainable practices within marine spaces are some of the topics we will touch upon here.
> 
> The section on 'Potential Future Activities' casts an eye forward to explore activities conducted elsewhere that hold potential for implementation in Delaware. This comparitive analysis serves to stimulate discussion and inspire innovative ideas, by showcasing practices proven successful in other regions.
> 
> The 'Non-Activity Planning Features' section provides the report's spatial context. It focuses on the geographical, biological, and physical features of the marine and coastal environment – the elements that shape where, when, and how activities can take place. This will explore topics such as submerged landforms, currents, migration routes, and protected habitats, among others.
> 
> Our report then moves into an examination of the 'Interactions' between the different activity types. This discussion will feature an analysis of the potential challenges, conflicts, and synergies that might occur between activities. This section will aim to highlight the interconnectedness of activities within the marine environment and touch upon the repercussions of these interactions.
> 
> Finally, the report concludes with a segment on the 'Recommendations for Future Work'. It is here that ideas, practices and strategies for informed decision-making and planning within Delaware's marine waters will be gathered and presented. The recommendations will underscore the importance of a comprehensive, spatially-informed approach that fosters sustainable and harmonious activity within our marine environment.
> 
> By framing our examination within these divisions, we hope to provide a complete and nuanced understanding of Delaware's marine landscape, and encourage a sustainable approach towards its future.
