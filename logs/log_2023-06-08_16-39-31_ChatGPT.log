> In econometrics, is it more typical to write "reduced form specification" or "reduced-form specification"?
**assistant**:
> In academic and professional writing, it is more typical to use the hyphenated version "reduced-form specification." This is because "reduced-form" is a compound adjective modifying "specification." The use of a hyphen in compound adjectives before the noun they modify helps to avoid potential ambiguity. Therefore, "reduced-form specification" would be the more grammatically correct and standard way to write this term.
