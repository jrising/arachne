> How do I reference an image in the static folder of a Flask application, from one of the html pages?
**assistant**:
> To reference an image in the static folder of a Flask application from an HTML page, you can use the `url_for()` function provided by Flask. This function generates the URL for the specified static file.
> 
> Here's an example of referencing an image named "example.png" within the "static" folder from an HTML page in your Flask app:
> 
> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html lang="en">
> <head>
>     <meta charset="UTF-8">
>     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>     <title>Flask Image Example</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='example.png') }}" alt="Example Image">
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> 
> In this code, `url_for()` takes two arguments:
> * The first argument `'static'` refers to the name of the endpoint that serves static files in the Flask app.
> * The second argument `filename='example.png'` specifies the file (the image in this case) you want to reference.
> 
> This will generate the correct URL for your image in the "static" folder, regardless of the specific folder structure.
