> I am planning a 2-day camping trip to Hickory Run State Park with my 3-year-old son, who has never been camping before. We'll be going from Friday evening to Sunday morning. Can you give me a suggestion for (1) stuff to get, (2) meal plans, and (3) activities?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James! Here's a rough plan for your camping trip with your little one.

> 
> ## Stuff To Get
> 
> 1. **Tent:** A 2- or 3-person tent is enough and would give you both some extra room.
> 2. **Sleeping bags:** Even in the spring or summer, it could get cold at night.
> 3. **Camping mattress or air bed:** This would add a layer of comfort and protect from the cold ground.
> 4. **Layers of clothing**: It might be warm during the day but cold at night. Also pack rainproof jackets just in case.
> 5. **First-aid kit**: Include any medicines your child might need.
> 6. **Camping stove and fuel**: Check if the park allows them. If not, you may have to adjust the meal plan.
> 7. **Light**: Flashlights, headlamps, and a lantern for the tent.
> 8. **Bug spray and sunscreen**: Protect your little explorer from insects and sunburn! 
> 9. **Camping chairs**: For your comfort.
> 10. **Toys and books**: Something familiar from home can help keep your child comfortable in this new environment.
> 11. **Trash bags**: Leave no trace!
> 
> ## Meal Plan
> 
> Here's a simple and child-friendly meal plan:
> 
> * **Friday Dinner:** Pre-made pasta salad (you can prepare it at home and keep it in a cooler).
> * **Saturday Breakfast:** Pancakes with syrup and fruits (bananas, berries). You can use a camping stove and a pan for this.
> * **Saturday Lunch:** Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with a side of fruits or chips.
> * **Saturday Dinner:** Hot dogs cooked on a camping stove or over the campfire, if allowed, with a side of baked beans from a can.
> * **Sunday Breakfast:** Granola and milk with a side of bananas.
>    
> Remember to bring lots of snacks like granola bars, fruits, cheese sticks, etc!
> 
> ## Activities
> 
> 1. **Nature Walk or Hike:** Hickory Run State Park has over 40 miles of hiking trails.
> 2. **Scavenger Hunt:** You could make a simple list of things to find like "a bird," "a big leaf," "a squirrel," etc.
> 3. **Stargazing:** With minimal city lights, it's a great chance to observe the stars.
> 4. **Story Time:** Download some children's audiobooks, or bring a physical book to enjoy.
> 5. **Camping Crafts:** Coloring, simple crafting. You can bring paper and colors.
> 6. **Fishing:** If your little one is interested, there are some great places in the park for fishing!
