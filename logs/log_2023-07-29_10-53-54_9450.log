> I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time capabilities to tell the current date. However, usually you can check the date on your device's taskbar or menu. Alternatively, you can ask your device's built-in voice assistant (Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, etc.) for the current date.
