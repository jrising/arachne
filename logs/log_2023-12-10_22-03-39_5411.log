**user**:
> I have many websites, most of which are old and fail in various ways. I want some kind of system where I can monitor the sites. Eventually, I think I want to set up a system where any live service I make includes little status messages that are logged somewhere into a dashboard, but what kind of dashboard can I set up fairly readily to passively monitor my sites?
**assistant**:
> There are several ways you can set up a dashboard to passively monitor your websites. Here's a shortlist of some tools that can help:
> 
> 1. **Google Analytics**: This free tool gives you insight into various statistics about your website like traffic, behavior, and audience demographics. However, this is mostly geared towards SEO and marketing analyses rather than real-time system-level monitoring.
> 
> 2. **Google's Search Console**: This tool can be used to monitor server errors, loading issues, and security problems that may arise with your website.
> 
> 3. **Uptime Robot or StatusCake**: Both of these services will constantly ping your websites and alert you if they go down. They can send notifications via email, SMS, or directly to a Slack channel.
> 
> 4. **Datadog, New Relic, or Dynatrace**: These SaaS platforms offer comprehensive reporting and alerts for data from servers, databases, tools, and services. They can indicate how well your system is working in real time and can be set up to understand custom status messages.
> 
> 5. **Cyfe or Klipfolio**: These are all-in-one business dashboards that allow you to gather data from many sources (social media, SEO, SEM, emails). While you might need to massage the services a bit to provide the pinging functionality, their structure would support a nice website-monitoring dashboard.
> 
> Overall, for monitoring the health of your web services, I'd recommend something more like Uptime Robot or Datadog, as they are built to monitor performance and availability.
> 
> In the long term, once you have status messages coming from live services, using a more sophisticated service like Datadog or New Relic would enable you to monitor application performance (APM) and log management in one platform. They also provide APIs you can use to automate the setup and configuration across all your services, and integrate the status or logs with the dashboards. 
> 
> Remember, any monitoring tool you choose should be able to scale as the number of your sites grows, and should be easy to integrate with any alerting or issue tracking system you use.
