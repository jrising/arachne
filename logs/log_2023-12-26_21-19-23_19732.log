**user**:
> I need to write my own implementation of the random forest algorithm. In my data, I have both categorical and numerical columns. For the numerical columns, I think that theoretically one would try each possible 2-way split (above or below each value found in the data), but my test for the best split is slow so I want to reduce the complexity. My idea is to just choose possible numerical split-points randomly. So, one version of this would just test one possible split point for that column, but try different split points at different points in the trees and across trees. Is this sufficient?
**assistant**:
> Yes, your strategy to randomly choose split points could lower computational complexity very effectively. Testing every possible split point in numerical columns has a complexity of O(n log n), so if your test function is slow, the bottleneck could be significant. Reducing this to, for example, O(log n) by randomly selecting split points could be a large improvement.
> 
> However, there is a trade-off concerning the algorithm's robustness and accuracy. When you select split points randomly, you may overlook values that could have induced optimal tree splits leading to more accurate models. This means the performance of your Random Forests might actually suffer compared to a normally implemented one.
> 
> A compromise solution that many tree-based methods use, including some implementations of Random Forests, is to select sub-optimal split points based on quantiles. For example, you might take the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the features as potential split points, which will give a broad coverage of the feature space while significantly reducing computational costs. This maintains a balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy.
> 
> This method still maintains the core strengths of a Random Forest: it benefits from uncorrelated trees due to random subsets of data and random subsets of features at each split.
> 
> To evaluate the reduction in accuracy, you could try comparing the performance of your less compute-intensive version with a full Random Forest on smaller datasets. If the loss in accuracy is minimal, then your solution might be more than sufficient for your needs. 
> 
> Remember, Random Forests are really a 'bag' of decision trees that all vote on the outcome, so it's the law of large numbers that really gets them to perform well. If you are pruning individual trees too aggressively, the overall performance could be affected. As long as your strategy doesn't prune too much, you should get performance that is on par with full Random Forests.
