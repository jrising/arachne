**user**:
> Where should "van der Ploeg" be alphabetized in a reference list?
**assistant**:
> In a reference list, "van der Ploeg" should be alphabetized under "V". When using a system that alphabetizes based on the surname, prefixes that are part of the surname are typically included.
> 
> Remember, though, it's advisable to check the specific rules outlined by the style guide you're using. Different guides may have differing rules. APA, for example, includes the lowercase prefix with the rest of the last name when alphabetizing.
