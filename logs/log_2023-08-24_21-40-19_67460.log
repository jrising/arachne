> How do I get employment from the census at the NAICS level, at high resolution (county or finer)?
**assistant**:
> Getting employment data at the NAICS level with high resolution (such as at the county level or finer), involves sourcing data from various sources. The steps below outline how to proceed:
> 
> 1. **U.S. Census Bureau's County Business Patterns (CBP):** The CBP provides county, state, and national level business data including number of establishments, employment, and payroll. This data also includes detail by NAICS code. You can download the CBP data from the US Census Bureau's [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) platform.
> 
> 2. **U.S. Census Bureau's ZIP Code Business Patterns (ZBP):** The ZBP provides data at the ZIP code level, which can give you a finer resolution than county level data. Like the CBP, ZBP provides detailed annual information on the number of establishments, employees, and payroll from businesses classified by NAICS code. You can also download the ZIP Code Business Patterns data from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).
> 
> 3. **The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program:** The LEHD program, part of the Center for Economic Studies at the U.S. Census Bureau, provides the [Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/), which gives employment data at the county level and finer. However, the data for smaller areas might have noise-infusion for privacy protection.
> 
> 4. **The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program:** The QCEW program publishes a quarterly count of employment and wages reported by employers covering more than 95 percent of U.S. jobs, available at the county, MSA, state and national levels by industry, but the data is not as fine-grained as ZIP code.
> 
> Please note, however, that due to provisions in Title 13 of the US Code, fine-scale data may be suppressed to prevent the identification of specific businesses. Therefore, more granular data is likely to contain a larger number of suppressed data points. Also, consider that finer resolution data may not be directly compatible with county level data due to geographical differences between ZIP Codes and county boundaries.

> I need 6-digit NAICS code information, but the ZBP only has 2-digit level. Where can I find 6-digit level?
**assistant**:
> Apologies for the confusion. If you specifically require 6-digit NAICS code information, the ZIP Code Business Patterns (ZBP) dataset may not provide the required level of detail. However, you can access 6-digit NAICS code information from other sources. Here are a few options:
> 
> 1. **U.S. Census Bureau's County Business Patterns (CBP):** The CBP dataset includes employment data at the 6-digit NAICS level. You can visit the U.S. Census Bureau's [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) platform and search for the County Business Patterns dataset. Filter the data to the desired geographic area (e.g., county) and select the relevant year to obtain employment information at the 6-digit NAICS code level.
> 
> 2. **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):** The BLS provides employment statistics, including the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program, which offers detailed employment and wage data by industry. While the QCEW data is generally available at the county level, it may also be accessible at more detailed industry levels. Visit the BLS website ([www.bls.gov](https://www.bls.gov/)) or explore their data portal to access the desired data.
> 
> 3. **State and Local Government Websites:** In some cases, state and local government agencies provide more detailed employment data at the 6-digit NAICS code level. Check the websites of state or regional economic development agencies, labor departments, or statistical offices to explore the availability of such data for your specific area of interest.
> 
> Keep in mind that the availability of 6-digit NAICS code data may vary based on the region and the specific dataset. It's recommended to consult multiple sources and explore data platforms to find the most comprehensive and up-to-date information for your analysis.
