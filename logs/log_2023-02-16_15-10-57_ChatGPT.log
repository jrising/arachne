**assistant**:
> It's possible for average land temperatures to be warmer or cooler than the global mean temperature, depending on a variety of factors. 
> 
> The global mean temperature is typically calculated by combining temperature measurements from both land and ocean sources, and is an estimate of the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. Land temperatures, on the other hand, refer specifically to the temperature of the Earth's surface on land.
> 
> There are certain regions on land that can experience temperatures that are significantly warmer than the global mean temperature, such as deserts or urban areas with a lot of concrete and asphalt. However, there are also regions that are cooler than the global mean temperature, such as high altitude areas or polar regions.
> 
> It's also worth noting that the global mean temperature can change over time due to a variety of factors, including natural climate variability and human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions. So, while it's possible for land temperatures to be warmer or cooler than the global mean temperature, both are subject to change over time.
