> My toilet has started doing something weird. When I flush, the cap at the bottom of the basin behind the seat gets caught above the rod that's connected to the handle. So the only way to get the cap to go back down is the physically move over the rod so the cap can fall again. I don't know how this started happening or what to do about it.
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you're dealing with a misaligned toilet flapper and rod, which is a fairly common plumbing issue. Luckily, it's also one we can likely tackle without need for a professional handyman. Here's a simple process to potentially resolve it:
> 
> 1. **Turn off the water to the toilet:** Look behind the toilet for a small round or oval metal handle that's attached to a pipe. This is the water supply valve. Turn this handle clockwise to shut off water flow to the toilet.
> 
> 2. **Remove the toilet tank lid:** Be sure to place it on a flat, secure surface so it won't be accidentally knocked over and broken.
> 
> 3. **Inspect the flapper chain:** This is the chain that connects the flush lever (the rod connected to the handle) to the flapper (the cap you mentioned). The chain should have a little bit of slack when the toilet isn't being flushed, but not so much that it can get caught under the flapper. If the chain is too long, you can shorten it by moving the hook connecting it to the lever to another link further up the chain.
> 
> 4. **Inspect the position of the flapper:** Check if the flapper is directly over the hole it should cover when the toilet isn't being flushed. If it's off-center, try adjusting the arms that hold the flapper in place so they're perfectly aligned with the overflow tube.
> 
> 5. **Fix alignment of the handle:** If the handle rod is pushing the flapper to one side, it might need to be bent slightly. Be gentle to avoid breaking it.
> 
> 6. **Turn the water back on:** Once you've finished your adjustments, turn the water supply valve counterclockwise to turn it back on. Wait for the toilet tank to refill, then flush the toilet to check if your issue is resolved.
> 
> Remember, while this is a simple fix, always proceed with caution when tackling home repairs. If the problem continues or seems more complicated, it might be necessary to call a professional plumber for assistance.
