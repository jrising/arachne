> I have some Korean Won, as I head to the airport tomorrow in Seoul. I was planning on exchanging them for dollars there, but I wonder if there's a way to increase the amount I get for them significantly. e.g., I'm going to the UK in a week-- should I convert them straight to pounds? I have a Revolut account which I think has good exchange rates, can I have somewhere put the money straight into my account, rather than give it in cash? Is there another way?
**assistant**:
> When it comes to currency exchanges, there are a few strategies to maximize the amount you receive:
> 
> 1. **Exchange Rates**: Check the current exchange rates for KRW to USD and KRW to GBP. If the rates are better for KRW to GBP, it might be advantageous to convert directly to pounds. However, keep in mind that intermediary currency exchanges can sometimes incur additional fees which might negate any rate advantage.
> 
> 2. **Exchange Services**: Using Revolut is a smart choice since it offers competitive exchange rates. You can:
>    - Deposit your KRW cash into your local bank account or an international money exchange service that works with Revolut.
>    - If you canâ€™t deposit KRW directly, first convert KRW to a familiar currency like USD or EUR at a local exchange office, then transfer it to Revolut, and convert to GBP.
> 
> 3. **Airport Exchanges**: Airport exchange rates are usually less favorable due to high convenience fees. If you must use the airport service, try to exchange just enough to cover immediate needs and do the bulk of your conversion through better-rated services.
> 
> 4. **Online Currency Exchange**: Look into online currency exchange platforms like TransferWise (now Wise) or OFX. They might offer better rates. You typically need a bank account to transfer funds though, so consider this if you can deposit your KRW directly there.
> 
> 5. **Local Currency Exchange Offices**: Before leaving, compare rates from different exchange offices in Seoul. Some might offer better rates with lower fees compared to others.
> 
> In summary, for the most value:
> - Check if Revolut accepts direct KRW deposits. If not, convert KRW to USD or EUR and then use Revolut for final conversion to GBP.
> - Avoid airport exchange services unless necessary.
> - Compare online platforms and local exchange rates to get the best deal before and after traveling.

**user**:
> So, airport exchanges are not a good deal, but that's the last chance I have to change the money in this country. Will I get worse exchange rates (say at a normal bank) when I'm back in the US?
**assistant**:
> Airport exchanges typically offer less favorable rates due to higher fees and lower exchange rates compared to other local exchange services. However, when you return to the US, you have a few options to consider regarding currency exchange:
> 
> 1. **Banks**: Although exchange rates at banks might not be as competitive as online services like Revolut or Wise, they generally offer better rates than airport exchange services. If you need to exchange currency, a local bank in the US could be a better option than an airport service.
> 
> 2. **Specialized Currency Exchange Services**: Certain entities specialize in currency exchange and can offer competitive rates. These include dedicated currency exchange offices, which can be found in major cities and tourist areas.
> 
> 3. **Online Platforms**: Online currency exchange platforms like Revolut, Wise, or similar services might offer better rates compared to traditional banks and airport exchanges. You can consider these options for future exchanges.
> 
> 4. **Check with Your Bank**: Before making any exchange, you might want to check with your bank to see if they offer currency exchange services and to inquire about the rates and fees associated with the exchange.
> 
> While you may not get the best rates at an airport exchange, if it's your only option at that point, it might be necessary for immediate needs. However, once you're back in the US, exploring alternative options like banks, specialized exchange services, or online platforms can potentially provide better rates.

**user**:
> How would an online platform work to exchange the money when I have physical cash? I don't need it to stay physical-- that is, I don't need physical USD-- but I can't give my KRW to Wise.
**assistant**:
> If you have physical cash in Korean Won (KRW) and want to convert it to another currency through an online platform like Wise (formerly TransferWise), you have a few options to consider:
> 
> 1. **Deposit Cash to Bank Account**: The first step would be to deposit your KRW cash into a local bank account that is linked to an online platform like Wise. Once the cash is deposited, you can then use Wise to exchange the funds from KRW to your desired currency at a competitive rate.
> 
> 2. **Use a Currency Exchange Service**: Another option is to first convert your KRW into a more widely accepted currency (such as USD or EUR) at a local currency exchange service with better rates. Once you have the new currency, you can then deposit it into your bank account and use Wise to convert it to the currency of your choice.
> 
> 3. **Find a Local Partner**: Some online platforms have partnerships with local services that allow for cash deposits that can then be exchanged online. You can inquire with Wise or other similar platforms if such services are available in your area.
> 
> 4. **Consider Trusted Third-Party Services**: In some cases, there may be trustworthy third-party services that can facilitate the exchange of physical cash to digital currency. These services may charge a fee, so it's essential to research and verify their legitimacy before proceeding.
> 
> 5. **Convert Physical Cash Locally**: If none of the above options are viable, you may have to consider converting your KRW to a more widely accepted currency through a local exchange service and carrying that cash back to the US for deposit into your bank account.
> 
> It's crucial to ensure the safety of your funds during any currency exchange transactions. Always choose reputable and secure services, and be aware of any associated fees or exchange rates that may impact the amount you receive in the end.
> 
> Do you have a preference for any of the options mentioned, or would you like more information on a specific aspect of the process?
