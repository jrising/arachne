> I hope you are well. A few days back, I discussed it with the graduate college and the above was their response. Since you have given your consent to serve as a potential advisor, I will also discuss it with the Program Director, Professor Moffat. Professor, secondly what about the courses that I have taken in the Biden School? Most of them are PhD level courses, can they (or some of them) be counted towards the EE PhD Program? Lastly, if approved, do I shift immediately or in Fall 2025?

He has shown some conditional willingness but since the date for funding has lapsed, the funding will be a potential issue. Is it possible that my current funding which I am getting as a PhD student from the Biden School is transferred to the Environmental Economics Program (for one year or sometime, they can figure out funding)? Alternatively, what else can be the way out, can graduate college provide some funding?

> Regarding your queries, you need to secure funding before initiating a transfer to ensure a smooth transition to the Environmental Economics (EE) PhD Program. While funding structures can differ, it's often feasible to work out these specifics quickly once a funding source is identified. I recommend prioritizing discussions with Professor Moffat as well as the Program Director for Environmental Economics to explore possible funding avenues.
