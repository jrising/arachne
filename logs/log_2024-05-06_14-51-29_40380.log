> What is the worst-case number of "rounds" of comparison that might need to be done for an parallel odd-even sort of 6 elements?
**assistant**:
> The odd-even sort is a comparatively simple, comparison-based sort. In parallel computation, it can achieve high performance, as comparisons and swaps can be done simultaneously.
> 
> The odd-even sort operates by iterating through "odd" steps and "even" steps:
> - In an "odd" step, it compares all odd-indexed elements with the next one and swaps them if necessary, i.e. a comparison and a potential swap is done between elements at positions 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and so forth.
> - During an "even" step, it does the same for all even-indexed elements, i.e. positions 0 and 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5, etc.
> 
> For odd-even sort, the worst-case number of "rounds" is typically 2n, where n is the number of elements to sort. Therefore, for a list of 6 elements, the worst-case number of "rounds" is 2 * 6 = 12. However, in a parallel computation, each round (either odd or even) can be done simultaneously, so the computation steps are potentially halved, resulting in an optimal time of n rounds (i.e., 6 rounds for a 6-element list).
