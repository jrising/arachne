**assistant**:
> To hide the sidebar when viewed on smaller screens, such as those of mobile devices, and then make it appear with a menu button, you can use a combination of responsive design with CSS, JavaScript for the interaction, and a new HTML button.
> 
> Here's how you might do that.
> 
> First, update the sidebar div to be initially invisible on smaller screens and add an additional class:
> 
> ```HTML
> <!-- Sidebar -->
> <div id="history" class="bg-gray-100 p-4 history hidden md:block" >
>     Loading...
> </div>
> ```
> 
> The `hidden` class makes the element invisible by default and the`md:block` makes it visible in medium and larger screens.
> 
> Next, you will need to add a button that will cause the sidebar to appear when clicked:
> 
> ```HTML
> <button id="sidebarButton" class="md:hidden">Open Menu</button>
> ```
> 
> Now, let's add the JavaScript to make the sidebar appear when the button is clicked. We'll take advantage of the `toggle` method, which switches visibility on and off:
> 
> ```HTML
> <script>
> document.getElementById("sidebarButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
>     var sidebar = document.getElementById("history");
>     sidebar.classList.toggle("hidden");
> });
> </script>
> ```
> 
> This script fetches the button using its ID, adds a click event listener, and uses the event handler to flip the visibility of the sidebar each time the button is clicked.
> 
> If you want the sidebar to disappear again when a link inside it is clicked, you can add similar event listeners to those links.
> 
> Finally, you need to make sure all this JavaScript runs after the initial HTML is loaded, so it's best if the script tags are placed at the bottom of the HTML.
**user**:
> I also use jquery on my site. Can you simplify the js with that?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! If you're already using jQuery on your site, you can simplify the JavaScript code by using its functions. Here's an updated version of the code using jQuery:
> 
> ```HTML
> <!-- Sidebar -->
> <div id="history" class="bg-gray-100 p-4 history hidden md:block" >
>     Loading...
> </div>
> 
> <button id="sidebarButton" class="md:hidden">Open Menu</button>
> 
> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
> <script>
> $(document).ready(function() {
>   $("#sidebarButton").click(function() {
>     $("#history").toggle();
>   });
> });
> </script>
> ```
> 
> In this version, the jQuery library is included using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) link. Make sure to place the script tag for jQuery before the script that uses jQuery functions.
> 
> The `$(document).ready()` function ensures that the JavaScript code runs after the DOM has finished loading.
> 
> Then, the `$("#sidebarButton").click()` function is used to attach a click event listener to the button. When the button is clicked, the `$("#history").toggle()` function is called, which toggles the visibility of the sidebar.
> 
> This simplified code achieves the same result as the previous version, but with the use of jQuery functions instead.
