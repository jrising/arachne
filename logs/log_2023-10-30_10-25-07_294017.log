> The solution to decarbonizing the built environment looms unresolved over our future net-zero economy. Embodied and operational emissions from buildings today are responsible for 40% of the global count and are expected to increase with a warming climate. A number of exciting climate startups in green steel and cement have launched, but the call to decarbonize the heating and cooling of large buildings has gone largely unanswered. It’s time to pick up the phone: 25% of new power demand is used to heat and cool buildings and current usage already costs us over 4 Gigatons in annual emissions. Buildings present particularly thorny challenges because air source heat pumps require more energy not less, in turn costing asset owners more money not less (while also presenting challenges to grid stability). Ground source heat pumps are far more efficient but out of reach because current drill rig technology is too large and too slow to efficiently punch deep enough bores to serve large building loads. 70 top real-estate firms, representing over 1 billion sq feet of ownership, have pledged to cut emissions but must also remain business rationalists. So how can we decarbonize the heating and cooling of industrial facilities, data centers, warehouses, fulfillment centers, and office buildings - a $130 Billion market - while also offering a more attractive financial outcome to those owners? Get a renowned drilling expert to invent a better rig.
> Enter Bedrock Energy. Dr. Silviu Livescu is a legend in the petroleum engineering community: the former Chief Scientist for global pressure pumping at Baker Hughes and a board director for the Society of Petroleum Engineers, he has over 30 patents to his name and 15 years of experience in the field. Silviu had long innovated on hydrocarbon drilling, completions, and well intervention technology to push efficiency envelopes and then pivoted his career to do the same for decarbonization. Silviu met co-founder Joel Wishkovsky and, at Overture’s enthusiastic introduction, then teamed up with CEO Joselyn Lai, a Harvard and Bain-trained superstar experienced in startups. Silviu’s technological vision was to miniaturize cutting-edge oil and gas drilling technology onto a truck small enough to operate in urban environments, while still powerful enough to autonomously drill fast and deep underground. This would unlock ground-source heat pumps for large buildings and help save owners money in the process. With this vision, Overture introduced Bedrock to our friends Paul Straub and Lily Bernicker at Wireframe VC, who led the first round of funding in stealth a year ago. We were joined by Long Journey Ventures, Cantos, Third Derivative, and First Star as well.  
> The company has since attracted unbelievable talent - multidisciplinary subject-matter experts from Schlumberger, Chevron, ExxonMobile, Apple, and Amazon have joined the team to help prototype rigs that have substantially outperformed existing technology by 3-5x in space efficiency and energy performance. A software team has built complementary technology to enhance subsurface modeling and prediction analytics to guide the rig for maximum speed and efficiency and unlock more sure financing. The IRA provides extraordinary tax credits of 30-50% of installation costs and equally attractive depreciation schedules. This will help cement Bedrock as the most profitable and most efficient HVAC replacement for large-building owners. As Ruben Munger famously said, “show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome.” Bedrock is a breakthrough technology that puts the economic and incentives in-place to take on big building decarbonization.

> Excited to see Bedrock Energy come out of stealth to announce their $8.5 million Seed financing. The heating and cooling of large buildings is a huge unsolved emissions headache. Bedrock has invented a drill rig that can decarbonize this massive category by saving asset owners money. Congrats to Joselyn Lai, Silviu Livescu and their spectacular team. Read more here:
