**user**:
> I want to copy over a bunch of files, overwriting files in an existing directory tree on Linux. How can I do this?
**assistant**:
> You can use the `cp` (copy) command in Linux to copy files from one directory to another. If you want to overwrite all files without confirming each file manually, you can use the `-f` (force) option. Here's a generic sample command: 
> 
> ```bash
> cp -Rf source_directory/* destination_directory/
> ```
> 
> Let's break down the parts:
> 
> - `cp` is the command to copy files or directories.
> - `-R` stands for recursive, which means the command applies to the directory and its entire hierarchy of subdirectories.
> - `-f` (force) is optional and will overwrite the destination files without asking.
> - `source_directory/*` specifies that you want to copy all files and directories from within the source directory.
> - `destination_directory/` is where you want to copy these files.
> 
> Please remember to change `source_directory` and `destination_directory` to match your specific paths. Be very careful when using the `-f` option, as this will overwrite existing files without asking.
