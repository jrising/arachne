> What is the difference in stock data between close and adjusted close?
**assistant**:
> Sure, let's dive into that:
> 
> - **Close**: This is the final price at which a stock is traded during the regular trading hours on a given trading day. It's a snapshot of the stock price at the end of the trading session, capturing the last trade made.
> 
> - **Adjusted Close**: This price takes the regular closing price and adjusts it for any corporate actions that may have occurred before the next market open. These actions can include dividends, stock splits, and new stock offerings. The goal of this adjustment is to give a more accurate picture of a stock's value by accounting for these events, ensuring that historical price comparisons are consistent over time.
> 
> In summary:
> - **Close Price**: Raw end-of-day trading price.
> - **Adjusted Close Price**: Adjusted to reflect corporate events, providing a more consistent historical comparison.
