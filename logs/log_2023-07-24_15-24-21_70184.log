> I am using legend.position="bottom" in ggplot, but a single row is too wide. Can I break up my legends into multiple rows?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can. The legend can be broken up into multiple rows or columns with the `guides()` function in `ggplot2`. If your legend is long, breaking it up into multiple rows can make it easier to read. Here's an example:
> 
> ```r
> ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, color=factor)) +
>   geom_point() +
>   theme(legend.position="bottom") +
>   guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 2))   # Set the number of rows to what you need
> ```
> 
> In this code, `nrow = 2` breaks the legend up into two rows. You can change `2` to whatever number of rows suits your data. If you have lots and lots of legend items, you might also prefer to use `ncol` instead to split the legend into multiple columns.
