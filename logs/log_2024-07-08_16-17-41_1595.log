> In Julia, how can I get a list of all hours between two dates (e.g., 2020-01-01 midnight, 2020-01-01 1am, etc.)?
**assistant**:
> To generate a list of all hours between two dates in Julia, you can leverage the `DateTime` and `Dates` modules. Here's a step-by-step example:
> 
> 1. **Import the necessary modules**:
>    ```julia
>    using Dates
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Define the start and end dates**:
>    ```julia
>    start_date = DateTime("2020-01-01T00:00:00")
>    end_date = DateTime("2020-01-02T00:00:00")  # Adjust this as needed
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Generate the sequence of hours**:
>    ```julia
>    hours_list = start_date:Hour(1):end_date
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Convert to a simple `Vector{DateTime}` if needed**:
>    ```julia
>    hours_vector = collect(hours_list)
>    ```
> 
> Putting it all together, here's the complete code:
> 
> ```julia
> using Dates
> 
> start_date = DateTime("2020-01-01T00:00:00")
> end_date = DateTime("2020-01-02T00:00:00")  # Change this to your desired end date and time
> 
> hours_list = start_date:Hour(1):end_date
> hours_vector = collect(hours_list)
> 
> println(hours_vector)
> ```
> 
> The variable `hours_vector` will contain all the hourly `DateTime` entries from the `start_date` to the `end_date`. Note that `end_date` is inclusive in this range, so adjust accordingly if you don't want to include the last hour itself.
