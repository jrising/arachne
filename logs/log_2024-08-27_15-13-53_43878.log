> I am teaching a class on the coupling of natural to human systems, and I think that a discussion of indigenous ways of knowing would be good. I'm thinking of assigning something from Braiding Sweetgrass, but I don't know which chapter would help. I want something that discusses reciprocity and the coevolution of human society and plants. What would you suggest?

> "Braiding Sweetgrass" by Robin Wall Kimmerer is a wonderful choice for discussing indigenous ways of knowing and the relationship between humans and nature. For your focus on reciprocity and coevolution of human society and plants, I would recommend the chapter titled "The Three Sisters." This chapter explores the traditional planting of corn, beans, and squash together, a practice that embodies the principles of reciprocity and interdependence crucial to indigenous agricultural systems. It provides a beautiful narrative of how these plants co-evolve with human societies and support each other, mirroring how human societies can thrive when they embrace these natural relationships. This chapter will offer your students valuable insights into the intricate ties between people and the environment, grounded in indigenous knowledge systems.
