> I am trying to buy some psychedelic mushrooms from a guy, and he's been forthcoming about the strength and I think he's growing them, but when I texted him "Maybe I can grab em Friday morning from you?" he said:
> "Because this could be the issue. The doctor's script is equal to wu tang. Do we understand the wu tang clan?
> I will answer once you do."
> 
> What the heck is he talking about?
**assistant**:
> It's hard to decipher exactly what your source might be referring to, but let's break it down a bit. The phrase "the doctor's script is equal to Wu-Tang" is quite cryptic. It seems like he might be making an analogy or reference that requires some cultural knowledge.
> 
> 1. **Wu-Tang Clan**: The Wu-Tang Clan is a famous hip-hop group known for their complex lyrics, unique style, and strong cultural impact. Their body of work often includes intricate references and metaphors.
> 
> 2. **Doctor's Script**: This could be a reference to something official or prescribed, like a doctor's prescription, implying something that must be followed or is official in some way.
> 
> The way he's equating the doctor's script to the Wu-Tang Clan might imply you need to understand a deeper or more nuanced context or philosophy he's referring to before he answers your question definitively. It could be a test to see if you're on the same wavelength or understand certain references.
> 
> Here are a couple of potential interpretations:
> - **Philosophical Understanding**: He might be looking for an indication that you understand the significance or philosophy behind what you're asking for, similar to understanding the depth and complexity of Wu-Tang Clan's music.
> - **Cultural Reference or Inside Joke**: It could be an inside reference or joke, meaning he's vetting whether you're 'in the know' about certain cultural or subcultural nuances.
> 
> If you're comfortable, you might respond by asking for clarification or trying to reference something relevant about the Wu-Tang Clan to show your understanding. For example:
> - "I'm a fan of Wu-Tang! Only built 4 Cuban Linx is one of my favorites. Does that help?"
> - "Love the Wu-Tang Clan, their music is like no other. Are you referring to needing to be cautious and wise?"
> 
> If this feels too ambiguous or makes you uncomfortable, it might be worth considering whether you want to proceed with this transaction. Always prioritize safety and clarity in any interactions, especially those involving psychedelics.
