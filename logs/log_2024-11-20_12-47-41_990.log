**assistant**:
> Without detailed insights into the current set-up of your Salesforce fundraising/development system, I will highlight common areas where many organizations typically seek improvements:
> 
> 1. **Integration:** Ensure your Salesforce seamlessly integrates with other software such as your email marketing system, event tools, grant management system, and accounting software. A development strategy depends heavily on multi-channel communication and broad coordination. Effective integration will reduce the need for manual data transfer, reducing error and improving efficiency.
> 
> 2. **Ease of Use:** Some users find Salesforce interface to be complex and intimidating. Customizing the interface to enhance user friendliness could increase traction and enable more productive utilization by all staff.
> 
> 3. **Reporting & Analysis:** The system should facilitate easy extraction of data for periodic reports. Customized dashboards and reporting tools can be set up to automatically update and visualize progress toward development goals.
> 
> 4. **Donor Relationships:** Improve tracking of relationships and interactions with donors to provide a 360-degree view. This includes major gifts, planned gifts, grant applications, corporate partnerships, upon many other donor activities.
> 
> 5. **Automated Processes:** Use Salesforce's automation functionalities, such as automated emails when certain actions are taken, automatic updating of donor details, and scheduled tasks. This can greatly reduce administrative load and allow your team to focus on strategic tasks.
> 
> 6. **Data Quality:** Implement measures to enhance and maintain the quality of data entered into Salesforce.
> 
> 7. **Training:** Ensure that your team is adequately trained to use Salesforce effectively and is aware of all its functionalities related to fundraising/development. Include in the training how to properly input data so you're getting the most out of the system.
> 
> Remember, the most effective changes are those that respond directly to your team's needs and challenges, so it may be worthwhile to consult with them and get their suggestions for improvement.
