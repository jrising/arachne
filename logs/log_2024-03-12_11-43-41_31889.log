> HOW DO I GET BOARD MEMERBS MORE ENGAGED WITH my foundations work 
**assistant**:
> To get your board members more engaged with your foundation's work, you might consider the following strategies:
> 
> 1. **Align their passions with your mission:** One of the best ways to get board members engaged is to ensure that their personal and professional passions align with the work that your foundation does. If a board member is particularly interested in a specific area that's within your mission, allow them to work on projects or committees that relate to this interest.
> 
> 2. **Provide them with education about your cause:** Make sure that your board members are knowledgeable about the cause your foundation is supporting. This could be through presentations, workshops, or one-on-one discussions. The more they know and understand the cause, the more likely they are to become engaged in the work.
> 
> 3. **Set clear expectations:** Clear and realistic expectations for board members can help ensure that they know exactly what their role is. These expectations could relate to financial commitments, meeting attendance, committee work, or any other responsibilities. 
> 
> 4. **Offer meaningful work:** Board members are typically busy individuals, so make sure the work they're given is valuable and impactful. They'll be more motivated to engage if they can see the difference their efforts are making.
> 
> 5. **Communicate openly and often:** Maintaining open channels of communication is essential. Regular updates about the foundation's work, achievements, and challenges can help board members feel more connected to the cause.
> 
> 6. **Ask for their input and respect their time:** Board members often have considerable professional and life experience. Asking for their input or advice not only utilizes their expertise but also helps them feel valued and engaged. At the same time, remember to respect their time and not overburden them with too many responsibilities.
> 
> Remember, each board member has their own motivations and preferences, so it might require different strategies to fully engage everyone. Keep in mind that genuine engagement is a continuous process and often develops over time.
