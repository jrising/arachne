> I added a boxplot to a ggplot, and now my legend is filled with tiny boxplots. The legend was previously points with different shapes. How can I tell the boxplot to not affect the legend?
**assistant**:
> To prevent the boxplot from affecting the legend in `ggplot2`, you can set the `show.legend` parameter to `FALSE` in the `geom_boxplot()` function. This will exclude the boxplot geom from the legend, keeping the legend for your other geoms, such as points with different shapes.

> Here's an example of how you can do this:
> 
> ```r
> ggplot(data, aes(x = factor_variable, y = numeric_variable, shape = shape_variable)) +
>   geom_point() +
>   geom_boxplot(aes(group = factor_variable), show.legend = FALSE)
> ```
> 
> In this example, `shape_variable` is the aesthetic that defines the shapes for the points, and the `show.legend = FALSE` argument in `geom_boxplot()` ensures that the boxplots won't appear in the legend.
**user**:
> Also, my boxplots nicely dodge for multiple boxplots on the same x-coordinate but different groups. But I'm also showing dots on the boxplots, and those don't dodge. How can I make them dodge?
**assistant**:
> To make the points dodge along with the boxplots in `ggplot2`, you can use the `position_dodge()` function. You need to apply this positioning to the `geom_point()` layer. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```r
> ggplot(data, aes(x = factor_variable, y = numeric_variable)) +
>   geom_boxplot(aes(fill = group_variable), position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
>   geom_point(aes(shape = shape_variable), position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), size = 3)  # Adjust the size as needed
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> 
> - Set `position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)` for both `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_point()`. This ensures that both the boxplots and the points are dodged together.
> - Adjust the `width` value in `position_dodge()` if needed to get the desired spacing between the boxplots and the points.
> 
> This should allow your dots to align properly with the respective boxplots based on their groups.

> How can I do expand(0, 0) only on one side of an axis?
**assistant**:
> To apply `expand(0, 0)` only on one side of an axis in `ggplot2`, you can use the `scale_x_continuous()` or `scale_y_continuous()` functions with the `expand` argument specified differently for each side.
> 
> Hereâ€™s how you can specify the expansion for just one side of the axis:
> 
> ### Example for X-Axis
> If you want to apply `expand(0, 0)` only on the lower side of the x-axis (i.e., left side), you can use:
> 
> ```r
> ggplot(data, aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable)) +
>   geom_point() +
>   scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)))  # Adjust the second argument for the right side
> ```
> 
> ### Example for Y-Axis
> If you want to apply it only to the lower side of the y-axis (i.e., bottom side), you can use:
> 
> ```r
> ggplot(data, aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable)) +
>   geom_point() +
>   scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)))  # Adjust the second argument for the top side
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation
> - `expand = expansion(mult = c(lower, upper))` allows you to control the expansion for the lower and upper limits of the axis. 
> - Setting a value of `0` for one side and a non-zero value for the other gives you control over the expansion.
> 
> Feel free to adjust the expansion values to meet your specific visualization needs!
