> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
>  
> 
> I am writing to disclose my profound interest in joining your lab as a Ph.D. candidate with research assistantship at the University of Delaware. I am delighted and inspired by your articles. My goal is to apply my knowledge to make substantial contributions to aquatic resource management through protecting and managing biodiversity for sustainable food supply as well as improving services.

> As a graduate of Fisheries Science, I have the necessary theoretical and practical background in aquaculture, population dynamics and life history, Aquatic Ecology, fish biodiversity, conservation, impacts of climate change on marine fisheries, molecular biology, and DNA tools (barcoding, PCR, eDNA, etc.) that make me a competent contributor to your research project. My undergraduate research work and further active contribution as a research assistant to laboratory and field-based research projects have prepared me with invaluable research skills, including research design, data collection, data analysis (such as using tools like ArcGIS and basic 'R' programming), and inference drawing. Currently, I am working on a project entitled “Assessment of Aquatic Resources of the Sundarbans (the largest mangrove forest in the world),” in which the work of ecology, DNA barcoding, and stock assessment for sustainable aquatic resource management is going on. It is a great opportunity for me to work in collaboration with the government and different voluntary naturalist organizations on this project. I have made significant contributions to several articles related to natural resource management.

> Under your guidance, I strongly believe I will have the opportunity to become familiar with modern methodologies for addressing complex ecosystem issues, develop effective management strategies in a multicultural environment, and enhance my interpersonal skills - all of which will strengthen my research career and expertise. I unwaveringly believe that this research in aquatic and fisheries science will assist me with not only intellectual stimulation but also the ability to make a significant contribution to sustainably managing aquatic resources for human wellbeing.

> Dear Md. Mizanur Rahman,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in joining our lab at the University of Delaware. I appreciate your enthusiasm and detailed overview of your background in Fisheries Science.
> 
> Unfortunately, my current research endeavors are not closely aligned with aquatic resource management, which you've indicated as your primary interest. However, I highly recommend you consider reaching out to Dr. Anna Birkenbach, who specializes in this field and whose research might more closely align with your interests.
> 
> You can find a time to discuss your research interests further by scheduling a zoom meeting with me through this link: [https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0). Dr. Birkenbach's work could provide an excellent venue for your aspirations in sustainable aquatic resource management.
