**user**:
> How do I hide a linewidth legend in ggplot?
**assistant**:
> It's actually fairly straightforward to hide a specific legend in ggplot without affecting the layers it applies to.
> 
> If the linewidth was added using the `geom_line()` function, you likely specified a variable as the aesthetic `aes()`. For example:
> 
> ```r
> p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
>   geom_line(aes(linewidth = var))
> ```
> 
> If you want to hide the legend for 'var', you would alter your plot code as follows:
> 
> ```r
> p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
>   geom_line(aes(linewidth = var), show.legend = FALSE)
> ```
> 
> The `show.legend = FALSE` argument tells ggplot not to generate a legend for this geom.
> 
> However, note that the `linewidth` is not a standard aesthetic in `ggplot2`, so perhaps you are referring to the aesthetics `size` or `linetype`. This advice remains applicable, replacing `linewidth` with the aesthetic you're using.
> 
> Should you need more specific assistance with your plot, feel free to share your current code or ask further questions.
**user**:
> I have other aesthetics for which I do want to show the legend-- so my geom_polygon has a fill and a linewidth, and I only want to hide the linewidth legend.
**assistant**:
> I see, you want to hide the linewidth legend while still showing the fill legend for your `geom_polygon`. In that case, you can use the `guides()` function in combination with the `override.aes` argument to customize the legends individually.
> 
> Here's an example of how you can achieve this:
> 
> ```r
> p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
>   geom_polygon(aes(fill = var_fill, linewidth = var_linewidth), color = "black") +
>   guides(fill = guide_legend(), 
>          linewidth = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = 0, size = 0)))
> 
> ```
> 
> In this example, I assumed that you have separate variables for `var_fill` and `var_linewidth`. Replace them with the actual variable names you're using.
> 
> The `guides()` function allows you to customize the legend properties for specific aesthetics. By using `guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = 0, size = 0))`, we set the `linetype` and `size` to zero, effectively hiding the linewidth legend.
