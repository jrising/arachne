> I want to classify datasets as being "old" (> 10 years since an update) or "coarse" (> 10km resolution), but I also recognize that these are relative terms. My cut-off is set, but I don't want to use the terms "old" and "coarse" (well, maybe coarse is okay), given that many people will consider datasets >10 years old as still excellent data. What other wording could I use?
