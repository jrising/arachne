> How can I grep a file for lines that include either "United Kingdom" or "UK" (but just as a distinct word)?
**assistant**:
> To grep a file for lines containing either "United Kingdom" or "UK" as distinct words, you can use the `-E` option to enable extended regular expressions and the `-w` option to ensure you're matching whole words only. Here's a command that should work for you:
> 
> ```bash
> grep -Ew 'United Kingdom|UK' filename.txt
> ```

> Here's what each part does:
> - `grep`: The command-line tool to search text using patterns.
> - `-E`: Enables extended regular expressions, allowing the use of the `|` operator for "or" patterns.
> - `-w`: Ensures the patterns match whole words only.
> - `'United Kingdom|UK'`: The pattern to search for, using the `|` operator to specify "or".
> - `filename.txt`: The file you are searching within.
> 
> Replace `filename.txt` with the actual name of your file.
