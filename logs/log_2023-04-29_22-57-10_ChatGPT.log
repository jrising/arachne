> I am designing a new language, consisting only of the letters N, I, and O. Below I provide some information about the language, and then I have questions.
> 
> The meaning of words is related to the letters or groups of letters that make them up. Generally, the first letter/group of a root provides the general concept, and subsequent letters/groups refine it.
> 
> O denotes the definite, active, and immediate; and can be used for the first person pronoun, nomative case, present tense, indicative verbs, and to denote a noun is singular. As a root, it generally means "do".
> 
> I denotes the observable or dependent; and can be used for the second person pronoun, genitive case, future tense, subjunctive verbs, and to denote a plural mass noun. As a root, it generally means "describe".
> 
> N denotes the unknown or static; and can be used for the third person pronoun, accusative case, past tense, imperative verbs, and to denote a plural count noun. As a root, it generally means "be".
> 
> There are also 9 derived letters.
>  - OO makes B: act
>  - OI makes Q: change
>  - ON makes A: capable
>  - IO makes P: know
>  - II makes U: communicate
>  - IN makes L: opine
>  - NO makes R: make
>  - NI makes J: sense
>  - NN makes M: have
> 
> Nouns are constructed as [root]N<case count>; e.g., JN or JNR means "sensation".
> 
> Verbs are constructed as [root]O<tense conjugation>; e.g., QO or QOR means "changed".
> 
> Adjectives and adverbs are constructed as [root]I<shared ending>; e.g., PI means "known" and JNR PIR means "known sensation".
> 
> Opposites, like good and bad, are constructed by first using a root for the relevant dimension (quality in this case, PA), followed by O for one extreme (good, PAOI), N for the other extreme (bad, PANI), and I for the line between the two (evaluate, PAIO).
> 
> As another example, to describe colors, we start with J (sense), add R (N, the outward senses (O sight, I hearing, N tactile)), add P (I, the color dimension (O hue, I saturation, N lightness), and then a named color from OO (red) to NN (megenta), and I for an adjective. So, green is JRPUI.

Based on your descriptions, I understand that the language has a systematic way of constructing words and expressing various grammatical concepts. Now, please feel free to ask your questions about the language, and I will do my best to help you.
**user**:
