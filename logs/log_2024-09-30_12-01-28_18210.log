> Dear Dr. Rising,
> I hope you are doing well.
> My name is Nasrin Salehi, and I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a PhD in Environmental Science and Management under esteemed supervision at University of Delaware. I hold a Master’s degree in Intellectual property laws from Ankara University, where I achieved a GPA of 3.63.
> During my master's program, I focused on the research project titled, “Intellectual Property Policies, Green Technologies and Climate Change”. This project indicates the particular positive role of IP policies in distribution and development of green technologies and also discusses alternatives of green technologies that can promote the potential of climate change adaptation in developing countries.
> Currently, I am working as an IP specialist and innovation manager at Fars Science and Technology Park (FSTP), where I am dealing with green technology analysis, mitigation technologies and adaptive technologies strategy development and environmentally sound technologies evaluation, and technology transfer of green technologies.  My roles also as an Independent Researcher at Shiraz University and Researcher and Assistant in WIPO Asia Pacific Bureau Project has further honed my skills in interdisciplinary fields focusing on IP and environmental policy.
> I have reviewed your publications and research interests in climate change and modeling of social-environmental systems with focus on “The missing risks of climate change”. Your research aligns closely with my own research interests in green technology evaluation and sustainable development with my technical background. I am eager to contribute to your ongoing projects and bring my unique perspective and experience to your team.
> Enclosed is my CV, which provides details of my educational background, research experience, and professional achievements. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss any potential PhD positions in your research group and explore how my skills and interests can contribute to your work at your convenience.
> Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

> Dear Nasrin,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in the Ph.D. in Environmental Science and Management at the University of Delaware. Your background and research experience in intellectual property laws, green technology, and climate change are indeed impressive and relevant to the kind of interdisciplinary work we undertake.
> 
> However, please note that funding is limited for the Ph.D. programs. Given your interests and experience, I encourage you to mention me in your statement of purpose, particularly if your research in green technologies aligns with climate change risks and interdisciplinary modeling, which are part of my work.
> 
> I recommend applying by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funding opportunities.
