> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I am Peal, a first-semester Ph.D. student in Economics at Texas Tech University, writing to express my profound interest in Environmental Economics and my eagerness to join the esteemed Department of Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware.
> 
> While my application for the Fall 2023 term unfortunately didn't result in acceptance at UofD, my commitment to becoming part of your department remains unwavering. I have been impressed by the department's reputation for both research and curriculum.
> 
> I've had the privilege of reading your articles, including "Weather Drives Variation in COVID-19 Transmission and Detection" and "Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits." Your work has greatly influenced my understanding of environmental economics. I wanted to work on Environmental Economics and Policy by exploring sustainable development. 
> 
> I am writing to inquire about any available positions within your lab or department that align with my research interests. I have some experience in Python, Tableau, and R programming, as well as a developing analytical skill set, and I believe these could potentially contribute to the University of Delaware's academic community.
> 
> I have attached my curriculum vitae for your review, providing further details on my academic journey. 
> 
> Thank you for considering my inquiry. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to the University of Delaware's impactful research.

> Dear Peal,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your application last year was ranked highly, but we could not find sufficient funding to admit you. Unfortunately, that may continue to be the case this next year. Personally, while I have some open grant proposals, I do not expect to have extra funding beyond what's needed by my current PhD students.
> 
> One thing I can do is put your information from last time back into our pool, with a note that you are interested in transferring if there is a position available. Then, we can reach out to ask you to reapply if there's funding. Would that work?

Do they need to apply again, or can we reactivate their application, or can I just have them apply if funding is found?

> Dear Dr. Rising,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I am Peal, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at Texas Tech University. I am reaching out to you for a third consecutive year with an interest in joining the Department of Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware for the Fall 2025 term.
> 
> While my previous applications for Fall 2023 and Fall 2024 did not result in acceptance, my commitment to becoming part of your department has only strengthened. Over the course of my current study at Texas Tech University, I have completed advanced courses such as Microeconomics I, II, and III; Econometrics I, II, and III; and Macroeconomics I and II. In Fall 2024, I am enrolled in Environmental Economics, where I am learning GTAP modeling, which has further deepened my interest in sustainable development and policy analysis.
> 
> Although I am currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, I feel that my exposure to Environmental Economics has been limited here, and I am eager to engage more deeply in this field. If given the opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. under your supervision at the University of Delaware, I am willing to convert my current Ph.D. to a Master’s degree at Texas Tech University upon graduation in Spring 2025. I can join your school in Fall 2025.  I am driven by the possibility of working under your guidance and contributing to research that tackles the pressing challenges of climate change and environmental sustainability.
> 
> I would greatly appreciate any guidance on how I might strengthen my application for Fall 2025, as I am determined to be part of the University of Delaware’s impactful academic community. I have attached my updated CV for your review.
