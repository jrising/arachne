**user**:
> When is the government required to do cost-benefit analysis, along the lines of Circular A-4?
**assistant**:
> U.S. Federal Agencies are required to perform a thorough cost-benefit analysis (CBA) under the guidelines provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in Circular A-4 when developing regulations, particularly those that are "economically significant." 
> 
> An "economically significant" regulation, as defined by Executive Order 12866, is one that might:
> 
> 1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
>    
> 2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
> 
> 3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or
>    
> 4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order. 
> 
> Furthermore, regulatory actions that are not deemed economically significant but that are still deemed significant according to the other criteria listed in the Executive Order also usually require a form of CBA, even if potentially less rigorous. In essence, most relevant federal regulations should undergo some form of cost-benefit analysis to ensure their efficiency and effectiveness.
