> Confounding Adaptation in Perennial Climate Damages: A Unified Statistical Approach for Brazilian Coffee
> 
> Abstract
> Climate change poses significant risks to agricultural production, especially for perennial crops, a crucial form of semi-durable capital in many developing countries. Misreported perennial yields and unobserved crop management decisions can undermine understanding of these risks. In the context of Brazilian coffee production, this study demonstrates that extreme temperatures not only reduce yields but also shrink reported harvest area due to plant death and farmers’ selective harvesting. The marginal damages from extreme temperatures on production are twice their effect on reported yields, as these are calculated using harvested area rather than bearing area. By merging the perennial supply and statistical yield literatures within a structural econometric framework, the effects of management decisions become distinguishable. The analysis reveals both a direct effect of extreme temperatures on biophysical yields and a multiyear plant death effect, and supports a more comprehensive understanding of how prices, weather, and adaptation interact across many perennial crops.
> 
> Perennial crops account for 13% of global cropland but produce 35% of the value of agricultural exports (app. 1.1; Monfreda et al. 2008). Low-income economies are particularly reliant on perennial crops, which constitute an average 56% of the value of their agricultural exports and 10% of their total exports. Despite their economic significance, most agricultural research has focused on annual crops, leaving the understanding of perennials’ response to environmental factors, notably climate and weather conditions, comparatively understudied. A critical gap in current research is the accurate measurement of the response of perennial crop production to extreme weather (Devadoss and Luckstead 2010; Wang and Alonzo 2013).
> 
> Perennial crops possess unique characteristics that demand a nuanced understanding of their responses to environmental shocks and adaptation actions. Perennials are a form of semi-durable capital, requiring long investment horizons and the management of environmental variability.1 Perennial crop production is deeply influenced by managed factors such as plantings, removals, and age distributions, for which empirical data are typically unavailable. Many studies rely on recorded harvest areas as proxies when describing investment and yields (Askari and Cummings 1977; Elnagheeb and Florkowski 1993; Lobell et al. 2006).
> 
> As this study shows, the use of harvest areas can conflate planting decisions with harvesting decisions, obscuring the true impact of weather shocks on crop production and understating the potential for future adaptation. Poor weather can both reduce yields and kill plants. For both annuals and perennials, farmers can respond to these environmental shocks with both short-term intensive and long-term extensive management decisions. The effects of actions taken after observing a shock but before production outcomes are generally hidden to ex post statistical methods.
> 
> This study focuses on two hidden management decisions: selective harvesting and responses to die-off. Farmers can selectively harvest their most productive fields, reducing harvested area relative to planted area and boosting apparent yields. For example, fields that experienced die-off will not be harvested. Selective harvesting applies to both annual and perennial crops. However, die-off for perennials has multiyear consequences and demands new investment. Farmer decisions around new planting, removal of older, less-productive trees, and abandonment are hidden but affect the biophysical yield of an area.
> 
> Underlying this investigation is a pervasive data problem in national agricultural statistics. An accurate accounting of crop yields requires data on area planted, since harvested area hides the effects of selective harvest and die-off. However, a review of all crops reported by the US and Brazilian statistical agencies shows that planted area for perennial crops is universally unavailable in annual surveys (although it is reported in the US Census of Agriculture). While area of mature perennials is reported for many crops, there is strong evidence that it is unreliable in both countries (see app. 1.2). For annual crops, planted area is unavailable in many countries, and there is evidence that reported planted area in Brazil is actually harvested area for many crops and observations. The consequences of calculating yields using this information are elaborated in section 1.3.
> 
> Coffee production in Hawaii provides a useful case study of showing both the challenges with perennial crop data and evidence of selective harvesting, for a comparatively well-reported region (see app. 2.2). Combining data from the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) annual survey and the Census of Agriculture, between 1997 and 2022, harvested, planted, and bearing (mature tree) areas are only all available in four years. Mature plant area is reported as equal to harvested area in years when the annual survey reports both (2013–16) but an average of 9.4% higher than harvested area when compared to the available census years (2002, 2007, and 2012). The portion of planted or bearing area that is harvested declines with high temperatures. That is, even for the United States, perennial crop data are sparse and misreported but show evidence that damaging temperatures cause selective harvesting.
> 
> To investigate these dynamics, I consider coffee in Brazil. Coffee is an important perennial crop for many developing countries, exported by 34 low- and lower-middle-income countries across the tropics and supporting 25 million farmers worldwide (O’Brien and Kinnaird 2003) and an $81 billion industry (Sharf 2014), making it one of the most valuable commodities in the world. However, coffee is extremely vulnerable to climate change, perched at high elevations in hot regions. Already changes in climate are increasing the frequency of disease outbreaks and shifting suitable growing regions (Guilford 2014; Malkin 2014).
> 
> Below, I first show that the effect of extreme temperatures on production is twice the effect on reported yields. This reflects a combination of die-off and selective harvesting. I then develop a unified approach for investigating perennial dynamics in response to weather variation, accounting for management decisions. The next section describes the key features of perennial dynamics and provides a theoretical framework for understanding these hidden management decisions and their empirical consequences in relation to observed production and harvested areas. Section 2 empirically investigates the evidence of selective harvests and of persistent die-off effects. These exercises also provide the key information needed to calibrate the theoretical model, accounting for both effects and addressing the data issue in section 3.

> The threat of climate change to agricultural production is significant, but for perennial crops in developing countries, the risks reach new extremes. In my latest study, "Confounding Adaptation in Perennial Climate Damages: A Unified Statistical Approach for Brazilian Coffee," I uncover the alarming, yet previously unseen risks affecting the Brazilian coffee industry.

> Misreported perennial yields and crop management decisions can significantly impact our understanding of these risks. The study reveals that extreme temperatures do reduce yields - but they also shrink the reported harvest area due to plant death and farmers' selective harvesting. In other words, the actual damage from extreme temperatures on coffee production is twice as severe as effects recorded on reported yields.
> 
> In this investigation, I've developed a framework that merges perennial supply and statistical yield literature to distinguish the effects of management decisions. The process unearthed a direct impact of temperatures on biophysical yields and a prolonged plant death effect. The consequence? A detailed understanding of how prices, weather, and farmer adaptations interact in the realm of perennial crops - particularly crucial in developing economies.
