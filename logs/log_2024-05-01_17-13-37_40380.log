> I am writing a perspectives piece, aimed at both an economics and a common science journal. The piece is trying to describe how interdisciplinary work can be done on climate risks, and spends time describing differences of assumptions between economic and physical science fields.

> The structure you have used – assumptions and their corollaries – is an excellent way to make explicit the underlying beliefs of both fields. In your presentation, there are several approaches you could consider:
> 
> 1. **Highlighted Boxes:** Breaking away from the main text, you could present these assumptions in distinct, shaded boxes. This would draw the reader's attention and convey the importance of these concepts. However, the downside is that it might break the narrative flow of the article.
> 
> 2. **Subsections:** You could organize them under separate subsections within your piece. Each field (physical sciences and economics) gets its own section with the assumptions clearly stated and with their corollaries discussed. This prioritizes narrative coherence over visual impact.
> 
> 3. **Tables:** Tables would allow you to present this information in a compact, easy-to-read manner. You could have columns for "Assumption," "Field," and "Corollary." The downside is, nuances are harder to express in this format.
> 
> 4. **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Similar to tables but with more room for text, set up a two-column layout with physical science assumptions on one side and economic assumptions on the other. This can enable easy comparison between the two fields.
> 
> 5. **Infographics:** For a highly visual impact, consider turning your assumptions and corollaries into an infographic. This approach, though potentially demanding in terms of design, can be highly effective in engaging readers. 
> 
> Consider your audience and the overall narrative flow of your piece when making your decision. For instance, for a common science journal, an infographic or highlighted box might be more appreciated, whereas an economics journal might appreciate a table or subsections format more. You can also incorporate reader feedback on your draft to determine which option is best.

> Remember: whatever option you choose, the clarity of your language and the strength of your argument will be the most important factors in effectively conveying your points.
