> In preparation for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, to be held in Glasgow in November 2021, signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change are, for the first time, revising their climate mitigation plans, known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs. The Paris Agreement set the common goal of limiting global average temperature increases, relative to pre-industrial levels, to "well below" two degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to one-point-five degrees Celsius. It also envisaged a five-year revision process to these NDCs to encourage increasingly ambitious national pledges. However, the commitments made in line with current NDCs fall far short of limiting global temperature increases to two degrees above pre-industrial levels, let alone one-point-five degrees. By 2030, under current policies, the gap in annual emissions compared with a two degrees least-cost pathway will have reached between fourteen and seventeen-and-a-half gigatons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to nearly half of current energy sector emissions.

> This research paper highlights the risks and likely impacts if the goals set under the Paris Agreement are not met, and the world follows an emissions pathway consistent with recent historical trends. Simply updating, without significantly enhancing, NDCs will not guarantee that the Paris Agreement goals are met; nor will enhanced pledges without swift and decisive delivery of those pledges. The governments of highly emitting countries have an opportunity to accelerate emissions reductions through ambitious revisions of their NDCs, significantly enhancing policy delivery mechanisms and incentivizing rapid large-scale investment in low-carbon technologies. This will lead to cheaper energy and avert the worst climate impacts.
