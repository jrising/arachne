> I am using a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy to identify resources and activities that should be taken into account for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. Here is a section of that report: --- The potential environmental impacts of the construction, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind projects are important to consider in the siting of offshore wind turbines. Potential impacts include avian mortality and displacement, habitat displacement, acoustic impacts on marine mammals and sea turtles, disruption of migratory routes, and sensitive fish habitat disturbance, including impacts on endangered, threatened, and rare species. Data on the distribution and abundance of endangered, threatened, and protected species were compiled to evaluate the use of the marine environment by wildlife that may be affected by offshore wind development. Information on abundance, migration and residency, and extent of habitat can be analyzed for geographical overlap and the degree to which biologically significant impacts and dislocation of competing users may occur. From a scientific standpoint, biologically significant impacts can be considered to individuals or to populations. Impacts to individuals occur when the animal’s ability to grow, survive, and reproduce is compromised, while population-level effects can affect the viability of the species (National Research Council, 2005). Here, it is logical to consider biologically significant impacts at the population level, as many activities in the ocean can impact individuals and not every biologically significant impact to an individual will necessarily trigger the preparation of an EIS (as opposed to an EA) under NEPA. Further, while wildlife protection laws regulate impacts to individuals, they focus management attention at the population level. For example, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) ensures that stocks, or interbreeding groups of the same species, remain above the optimal sustainable population (16 USC 1361 et seq.) The Endangered Species Act (ESA) likewise manages for species, subspecies or distinct population segments (16 USC 1532). Lastly, benefits from CO2 reductions resulting from decreased use of fossil fuels are generally thought of on a large scale, in which benefits to wildlife would be assessed on a population level rather than individual level. From a management perspective, it is important that we consider impacts to groups larger than the individual as we look towards long-term viability of each species. Avian The study area is located within the avian Atlantic Flyway. Delaware Bay and Atlantic nearer-shore waters, areas, which are potentially valuable for offshore wind power, are also likely to have significant avian activity. Risks of collision, habitat displacement, and travel changes have been quantified at several European wind projects, with many species having shown avoidance behaviors (Desholm & Kahlert, 2005; Huppop et al., 2006; Pettersson, 2005). Although a growing body of literature highlights impacts to avians from land-based wind turbines in the U.S., seabirds are exposed to different conditions, and land-based impacts should not be extrapolated. There is a need to integrate information that identifies the potential primary wind production areas with seabird distribution and abundance (Michel et al., 2007). A recent report has highlighted the potential build out in the mid-Atlantic, identifying trends of avifauna across the region inclusive of population estimates and species/subspecies and population-specific potential biological removal levels, which are each based on an estimate of the level of incidental take that will not jeopardize the given population (Watts, 2010). To address the potential for avian impacts, this portion of the project followed the Northwestern Atlantic Birds at Sea Conservation Cooperative’s ranking of priority species for assessment and has identified avifauna within the study area that should be considered when planning for offshore wind projects. Please refer to Maps 27-37. Avian data were acquired from the USGS as an ArcGIS geodatabase that includes the compilation of at least 62 different data sources from 1978-2009 (O’Connell et al., 2009). These data include more than 85% of all seabird occurrence information for the U.S. Atlantic currently known to exist. The datasets varied in spatial and temporal scale as well as in quality. Some data were obtained from surveys with standardized sampling frames while others were collected opportunistically independent of a probabilistic sample. Data types and fields were standardized across datasets to make the data as consistent as possible. Sampling effort was calculated in units of five-minute equivalents either as surveys that were conducted as discrete-time transects (typical of surveys prior to 1990) or as continuous-time transects (typical of modern surveys with GPS technology). Discrete time transects were calculated so that each five minute equivalent equals the number of five minute survey periods. Continuous time transects were calculated so that each five minute equivalent equals a survey segment of 0.8333 of a nautical mile, which is the distance traveled by a vessel traveling 10 knots for five minutes and which is equivalent to 1.85 km. The total number of five-minute equivalents was calculated for each 1/4-degree grid cell of a grid and effort was summarized by season (winter, spring, summer, and fall) (O’Connell et al., 2009). The effort-adjusted counts (collected over a 30-year period), however, do not account for detection probability. Therefore, maps should be used only to provide guidance as to potential for occurrence of a species during a season in each grid cell; a cell without data does not necessarily mean that avifauna does not occur within that cell, but rather, that avifauna has not been identified in that cell. The data can be used to understand general patterns of distribution in the U.S. Effort-corrected seabird distributions are overlain with grid cells with effort as polygon vector files. These are color- coded to indicate the level of occurrence. Species depicted were chosen based on access to data, their known occurrence in the study area, and their conservation status (see Table 4): Audubon's Shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri), Common Loon (Gavia immer), Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), Black Scoter (Melanitta nigra), Razorbill (Alca torda), Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), Dovekie (Alle alle), Great black-backed gull (Larus marinus), and Great Shearwater (Puffinus gravis), and Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus). Please refer to Maps 28 – 37. Both the Great Shearwater and the Audubon's Shearwater have been identified as a species in need of conservation due to population declines and threats to breeding grounds (USGS, 2010a; USGS 2010b). Both migrate across the Atlantic Coast in spring and summer. Of the alcids, both Razorbills and Dovekies have been increasing in abundance in the mid-Atlantic (Veit & Guris, 2008). Razorbills overwinter south of their breeding range in the coastal waters primarily along New York and New Jersey, and very occasionally along Virginia and the coast south of Virginia (Lavers et al., 2009). Razorbills sightings have dramatically increased off the mid-Atlantic coast since the 1990s, hypothesized to be linked to changing climate and oceanographic features in the North Atlantic, as well as changes to prey abundance (Veit & Guris, 2008). Dovekies winter in the low-arctic and boreal waters of northeastern North America. Dovekies also often travel south of their typical range along the east coast of the United States (Montevecchi & Stenhouse, 2002). In fact, Dovekies have been increasing in the mid-Atlantic since the 1990s, with large overwintering numbers in the New York Bight, possibly extending the winter range in a southerly direction (Veit & Guris, 2008). The Black Scoter, Common Loon, and Double-crested Cormorant breed in the North American inland regions and overwinter along the North American coasts (Bordage & Savard, 1995; Evers, Paruk, Mcintyre, & Barr, 2010; Hatch & Weseloh, 1999). The Common Loon ranges throughout North America (Evers et al., 2010), migrating to marine environments along the North American coasts during the winter and spring seasons (Evers et al., 2010). Double-crested Cormorants live along seacoasts and inland waters of the U.S. and Canada (Hatch & Weseloh, 1999). The Great Black- backed Gull is common in the northeastern United States and northern Europe (Good, 1998), migrating south to the southern United States in winter (Good, 1998). Cory’s Shearwater is found feeding along the east coast of North America May through August (NAS, 2011). The Northern Gannet breeds during the summer along the North Atlantic, particularly in New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and part of Canada (Waterbird Conservation for the Americas, 2011). During the remainder of the year, gannets spend most of their time foraging at sea (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2011). They range from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northern parts of the open Atlantic Ocean, extending toward Europe. Gannets plunge-dive for fish, often within flocks of hundreds of birds (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2011). In addition, recent studies on Red Knots (Calidris canutus, ESA candidate), piping plovers (Charadrius melodus, threatened Atlantic coastal breeding population), and roseate terns (Sterna dougallii, endangered North American breeding population) provide insights to the risk of offshore wind projects to these species. These species were studied in detail as ESA-listed or candidate species that are likely to be exposed to offshore wind development in the AOCS (Normandeau Associates, Inc. 2011). Researchers analyzed historic data and generated new data to determine collision risk and exposure at the macro scale (occurrence of species on the region), mesoscale (flight altitude), and micro scale (behavioral avoidance/susceptibility) (Normandeau Associates, Inc. 2011). Piping plovers were widely dispersed throughout the AOCS, indicating macroscale exposure. Elevated exposure in the nearshore/coastal environments is possible due to the affinity of this species to these environments. Micro- and mesoscale exposure are not well known due to limited knowledge of flight height and avoidance behavior of piping plovers (Normandeau Associates, Inc. 2011). Roseate terns migrate pelagically, and therefore are likely to have macroscale exposure during migration as well as breeding, although this does not indicate high risk due to the limited observational data. Migratory patterns of Red Knots were studied in greater detail, in part to analyze the risk of exposure to offshore wind turbines on the AOCS (Normandeau Associates, Inc. 2011). Red Knots were fitted with geolocators to track both the northern and southern migration. Three birds captured in Delaware Bay, and eight birds captured in Massachusetts returned with migration data. All birds spent the breeding season in the Arctic, migrating south to over-winter in a number of locations, with many stops along the route. Red Knots were found to generally migrate in a non- coastal pattern, although there may be a coastal migration of a minority of Red Knots along the Atlantic coast of the US. The low resolution of geolocators limits the data analysis, reported from two sources as 150 km to 250-300 km resolution, although errors can be reduced with analytical advances. This research indicates that macroscale exposure of Red Knots is concentrated to the south and southeast of Delaware Bay in spring, and south and southeast of Massachusetts in fall. Exposure to turbines beyond 3 nm may occur during the long migratory flight. Significantly higher exposure may occur in coastal or nearshore environments because Red Knots spend much more time in these environments. Although Red Knots are likely to be exposed to turbines, they are not necessarily at risk of collision, given a lack of understanding microscle and macroscale factors (Normandeau Associates, Inc. 2011).

(2009) **Presence determined from mapping results; data source O’Connell et al. (2009) A total of eleven maps are displayed to demonstrate the relative abundance of seabirds in the mid- Atlantic region. Interpretation of these maps can be difficult. First, grid cells that are outlined without color indicate areas where survey effort occurred with no sightings. Second, results displayed do not account for the probability of detection of a given species, and some seabird species may be easier to detect than others. Third, survey design among the studies aggregated here is not consistent. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with care. It is telling, however, to view areas where seabirds have been detected as this provides regulators and developers with a representation of areas where seabirds and wind turbines may be more likely to encounter spatial conflicts. Seabirds were selected from a list of priority species identified by O’Connell (2009) and by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The selection criteria include forage strategy, conservation status, and distribution. An aggregate seabirds map is provided for reference, although care should be taken when interpreting these results. Assessing threats generally occurs at a species–specific level, and species-specific maps are more telling from a management perspective. Furthermore, given the differences in seasonality of each species, aggregate distributions do not indicate that all of the birds are present in the study area at the same time. What is not depicted on the maps is the strong seasonality of seabird distribution within the study area (see Figure 3). As highly migratory species, each of the seabirds exhibits a strong seasonal component. Therefore, conflicts with offshore wind in terms of habitat use or migratory routes will vary by species, by season. In general, species have a strong presence in the summer and fall and little presence in the winter, though this trend is not the same for all species. The species Razorbill and Black Scoter, for example, are most prevalent in the winter and least prevalent in the summer (see Figure 4). Both of these species breed in the boreal regions of the North America and migrate south to the North American coasts during the winter (Lavers, et al. 2009; Bordage & Savard, 1995). --- Can you identify the list of resources or activities described in this section, and for each provide the following information: - Activity Name - Description - Current Status - Spatial Extent - Temporal Pattern - Potential Expansion/Changes - Stakeholders - Sources - Any other notes
