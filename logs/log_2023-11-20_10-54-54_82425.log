**user**:
> I am using loess to smooth a curve, from 1940 to 2020. I only want 20 years of data to be used in the smoothing. How can I use span to set this?
**assistant**:
> Sure, you can use the `span` parameter in the `loess` smoothing function in R to tune the degree of smoothing you desire. The `span` parameter is typically a value between 0 and 1 where 1 would include all of the data in the smoothing, and smaller values correspond to less data. For example, for a dataset of 1000 observations, a `span` of 0.1 would use the nearest 100 data points for smoothing each individual data point.
> 
> In your specific case, you have data from 1940 to 2020, so that's 81 years of data (assuming one data point per year). If you only want to use 20 years of data for smoothing, you would set the `span` to 20 / 81 = 0.2469 (approximately).

> Here's an example using the `loess()` function:
> 
> ```r
> # Assuming 'year' and 'data' are your variables
> smooth <- loess(data ~ year, span=0.2469)
> ```
> 
> This will smooth your curve with a span approximately equal to a moving window of 20 years. Note that this is an approximation, since LOESS doesn't work strictly with a moving window, but it should yield the desired effect.
