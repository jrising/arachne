> On my Ubuntu, when I try to update R with `sudo apt install r-base`, it says it's already at its most recent version, 4.4.0. But when I just say R in the terminal, I get version 3.2.2. How can I diagnose this?
**assistant**:
> The issue you're seeing likely arises from the fact that you have multiple versions of R installed on your machine and the older version is being called when you simply type `R` in the terminal.
> 
> Here's how you can diagnose and resolve the issue:
> 
> 1. **Check the location of the binary R file that gets executed:**
> 
>     In the terminal, type `which R`. This will return the path of the R which is getting executed. If it is not aligning with the latest R installed, then this is causing the problem.
> 
> 2. **Check the installed versions of R:**
> 
>     You can view all installed versions with `ls -l /usr/bin | grep r-base`.
> 
> 3. **Editing the PATH variable:**
> 
>     The versions could be installed in different directories and your PATH variable might be pointing to the directory containing the old version.
> 
>     - Check your PATH variable by typing `echo $PATH` in the terminal. This will show you the directories in the order they are searched for executables. The directory with the old R installation is probably listed before the directory with the new R installation.
>     
>     - Edit the PATH variable so that the directory with the new R installation is listed first. One typical way is editing the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file (depending on your system) and add these lines at the end:
>     
>         ```
>         PATH="/usr/local/bin/R:$PATH"
>         export PATH
>         ```
> 
> Remember that you need to replace "/usr/local/bin/R" with your path to the new version of R.
> 
> 4. **Create an alias:**
> 
>     You could also create an alias to always point to latest R, in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
>     
>     ```
>     alias R='/path/to/latest/R'
>     ```
>     
>     Replace '/path/to/latest/R' with the actual path to the new R.
> 
> After modifying .bashrc or .bash_profile, remember to source the file:
> 
> ```bash
> source ~/.bashrc
> # or
> source ~/.bash_profile
> ```
> 
> If this doesn't help, please provide the results of your diagnostics and I'll see how else I can assist.
**user**:
> I see that it's finding a version of R in Anaconda. The conda setup puts anaconda's path first. Should I update this in anaconda, or move that path to the end, or something else?
**assistant**:
> Since you've identified that the version of R that is being found is within Anaconda, you have a few options to resolve the issue. Here's what you can consider:
> 
> 1. **Change the order of paths**:
>     - **Move Anaconda path to the end**:
>         If changing the PATH variable is a viable option for you, you can move the Anaconda path to the end of the PATH variable.
>         
>         1. Open your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file.
>         2. Look for where the Anaconda path is included in the PATH variable.
>         3. Cut that entry and paste it at the end of the PATH variable.
>         4. Save the file and reload it by running:
>             ```bash
>             source ~/.bashrc
>             # or
>             source ~/.bash_profile
>             ```
> 
>     - **Creating a new conda environment**:
>         Alternatively, you could create a new conda environment without R. This way, the R version installed system-wide will take precedence.
> 
> 2. **Making use of Anaconda**:
>     If you frequently use R within Anaconda for your work, it might be best to manage your R installations through Anaconda itself. You can install the latest version of R within your Anaconda environment by running:
>     ```bash
>     conda install -c conda-forge r-base
>     ```
> 
> 3. **Using aliases or functions**:
>     - You could create an alias or function within your shell configuration file that specifically points to the system installation of R instead of the Anaconda version.
>     - For example, you could create an alias in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` like this:
>     ```bash
>     alias systemR="/usr/bin/R"
>     ```
> 
> 4. **On-demand selection**:
>     You can also explicitly call the system R version when needed by specifying the full path to it. For example, `/usr/bin/R`.
> 
> Choose the option that best fits your workflow and preferences. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask!
**user**:
> Can I just remove R from conda?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can remove the R installation from your Anaconda environment if you prefer to use the system-wide R installation instead. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. **Deactivate any active conda environments**:
>    It's good practice to deactivate any active conda environments before proceeding. You can deactivate the current environment by running:
>    ```bash
>    conda deactivate
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Remove the R installation**:
>    You can remove the R package from your Anaconda environment by running:
>    ```bash
>    conda remove r-base
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Verify R removal**:
>    You can confirm that R has been removed from the Anaconda environment by trying to run R. It should now default to the system-wide installation.
> 
> By removing the R package from your Anaconda environment, the system R installation should take precedence when you run `R` in the terminal.
> 
> If you encounter any issues during the removal process or if you need further assistance, please feel free to ask!
