> Can you write an invitation for a "Pi(e) Day Party", on Sunday, March 17? It will be at our house, 1940 S. Alder St., starting at 3:14pm. We'll be inviting our kids's families, and have at least 3 pies: fruit, key lime, and savory. It would be great for the invitation to have some silly parts, and mention some other activities.
**assistant**:
> Certainly, James! Here is a draft invitation that you might consider for your Pi(e) Day Party:

> # ðŸ¥§**Pi(e) Day Party!**ðŸ¥§
> 
> Dear [Recipient],
> 
> Irrationality is in the air! And it's time to honor our endless, non-repeating desire for the good stuff - that's right, the tau-riffic goodness of pie!
> 
> We invite you to join us at our **Pi(e) Day Party** on **Sunday, March 17** at our humble abode, located at **1940 S. Alder St**. The revelry commences at exactly **3:14 PM**, not a minute sooner, not a minute later!
> 
> Feast on a tantalizing trilogy of pies: a superbly sweet, flawlessly fruity pie, a zesty and tangy key lime pie, and as a hat tip to the connoisseurs of variety - a delectable savory pie that will keep you guessing its ingredients. They're our way of making the number 3.14 a purely delectable affair!
> 
> But wait, there's more! We've planned a day of activities that might sound irrational, but that's part of the fun. Expect a marathon storytelling session about the adventures of Sir Cumference, riveting games that may or may not involve throwing whipped cream, and of course, the crowning moment - a contest to see who remembers the most decimal places of pi!
> 
> Please do bring your kids, as our little ones are just as excited to share some fun activities and games. Together, we'll make this a day of mirth, merriment, and mathematics!
> 
> Reply to this email or call us at [your contact number] to RSVP. Do let us know if you have a pie preference or if you detest the the thought of piquant pie - we promise, no judgments!
> 
> After all, in the grand tradition of Pi Day, our party is about embracing the infinite...possibilities of fun, that is!
> 
> Looking forward to celebrating the wonders of the mathematical world (and its edible namesake) with you!
> 
> Best,
>

**user**:
> Johanna says it's far too long. She wants it phone-length. Can you shorten the text and make it just slightly less mathy?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a shorter and less math-focused version of the invitation:
