> Dear Maryam,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Considering your strong background in Environmental Science and related research experiences, you might be a good candidate for our Ph.D. programs in Environmental Economics or Marine Policy, both of which have an interdisciplinary focus that seems to align with your research interests.
> 
> However, funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to mention my name in your statement of purpose so that your application can be considered for any available funds related to my area of research. This best applies if you are exploring themes around climate change risks, food systems, or interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
> 
> Please consider applying by the end of this calendar year so that you can be fully reviewed for funding opportunities.

> Dear Professor James Rising
> 
> I am so appreciative of your kind response and the time you spent considering my application. It is my honor to be considered as your prospective student and have a chance to study under your supervision.
> There are several points to be mentioned. First and foremost, I will be taking part in the Duolingo exam soon and will use its score for the application on the website. Second, considering my research interest I prefer the marine policy program but if you consider me for the other program, it would be my pleasure to be part of it as well. Also, I do not know if it is possible to receive an application fee waiver or not. If this can be done it would be much more straightforward for me considering the economic sanctions in my country.
> 
> finally, I am honored and privileged to be a member of your research group and hope to be accepted for this PhD program.

> Dear Maryam,
> 
> Thank you for your reply. It's good to hear that your research interests align with the Marine Policy program, and that you are adaptable to other interdisciplinary studies as well. 
> 
> Unfortunately, there are currently no more fee waivers available. I understand this poses an additional challenge for you, considering the economic conditions in your country, but this factor is out of my direct control. 
> 
> As you prepare the Duolingo exam, I recommend continuing to focus on crafting a compelling personal statement that highlights your research interests, experiences, and why you wish to pursue your Ph.D. in Marine Policy or Environmental Economics. Please do remember to mention my name in your statement for the funding consideration as previously discussed.

> Dear Maryam,
> 
> Thank you for the additional information. I apologize for any confusion. In our Ph.D. programs, we accept either TOEFL or IELTS scores for English language proficiency. While Duolingo can be a valuable resource for language learning, we do not currently accept Duolingo exam scores as part of the application process.
> 
> I appreciate your understanding, and I encourage you to focus on preparing for the TOEFL or IELTS exam to meet our English language proficiency requirements.
> 
> If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm here to assist you throughout the application process.
