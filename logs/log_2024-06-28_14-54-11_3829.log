**assistant**:
> To look up the value in one column when a different column in the same row has a given value in Google Sheets, you can use functions like `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX`, and `MATCH`. Here are two methods to achieve this:
> 
> ### Method 1: Using `VLOOKUP`
> 
> Suppose you have the data as follows:
> 
> | A     | B       |
> |-------|---------|
> | Apple | Red     |
> | Banana| Yellow  |
> | Grape | Purple  |
> 
> If you want to find the color (Column B) of "Banana" (Column A), follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Set the value you’re searching for (e.g., "Banana") in cell D1.
> 2. Use the `VLOOKUP` function to find the corresponding value in Column B.
> 
> ```plaintext
> =VLOOKUP(D1, A:B, 2, FALSE)
> ```
> 
> This formula searches for "Banana" in Column A and returns the value in the second column (Column B) of the same row.
> 
> ### Method 2: Using `INDEX` and `MATCH`
> 
> Using the same data:
> 
> 1. Set the value you’re searching for (e.g., "Banana") in cell D1.
> 2. Use the `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions together to find the corresponding value.
> 
> ```plaintext
> =INDEX(B:B, MATCH(D1, A:A, 0))
> ```
> 
> This formula uses `MATCH` to find the row number where "Banana" is located in Column A and then `INDEX` to retrieve the value in Column B of that row.
> 
> Either method will effectively allow you to look up values in one column based on the values in another column. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
