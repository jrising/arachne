> I have a list of topics to discuss in a lecture on geoengeering. What is the term used to describe the possibility that actors will flip from being hesitant about doing mitigation to being very pro-geoengineering?
**assistant**:
> The term often used to describe this possibility is "moral hazard". The concept of Moral Hazard in climate geoengineering refers to the perception that accessibility and success of geoengineering might reduce the motivation to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. It's a concern because it could lead to an over-reliance on geoengineering strategies to combact climate change, at the cost of not addressing the root causes, which are primarily related to greenhouse gas emissions.
**user**:
> Not that. In the novel "Termination Shock", it's said that this is a big concern. Fossil fuel companies will flip from saying that they support mitigation in theory, but dragging their heels, to saying "geoengineering is the only way".
**assistant**:
> Ah, I see. The term used to describe this phenomenon in the context you mentioned from the novel "Termination Shock" is often referred to as "strategic flip". This strategic flip occurs when actors, such as fossil fuel companies, shift their stance from appearing supportive of mitigation efforts to advocating for geoengineering as the primary solution to address climate change. The concern is that this shift may reflect a strategic decision to maintain the status quo or prioritize interests that align with geoengineering over emission reductions.
