> The value of different storage technologies depends on their ability to cost-effectively provide electricity during gaps in solar and wind resources, and thus reduce the overbuild of solar and wind generation capacity needed to reliably meet electricity demand.
> 
> We investigated the influence of regional variability in wind and solar resources on the value of single- and multi-storage technology portfolios.
> 
> Long-duration energy storage can be charged slowly over time to accommodate seasonal fluctuations in electricity supply or demand, but still requires substantial discharge power-capacity to meet large demand spikes during weather events.
> 
> Long-duration storage technologies may serve a dual role by providing short-term storage with their existing power-capacity, making it more difficult for short-duration storage technologies to further reduce system costs.
> 
> In both wind-heavy and solar-heavy regions, least-cost systems contained sufficient power-capacity from long-duration storage to also meet short-term power needs, so that the addition of short-duration storage did not markedly reduce total system costs.
> 
> Thus, in electricity systems relying on wind and solar generation, contingent on social and geographic constraints, long-duration storage may be able to cost-effectively provide the services that would otherwise be provided by shorter-duration storage technologies.

> ### Long-Duration Storage: A Dual-Purpose Solution
> 
> Different energy storage technologies vary in their ability to cost-efficiently deliver electricity during periods without adequate wind or solar power, thereby reducing the need for excessive solar and wind capacity to meet electricity demands reliably.
> 
> We explored how the regional differences in solar and wind resources affect the value of portfolios that use single or multiple storage technologies.
> 
> Long-duration energy storage systems can be gradually charged over time to adjust to seasonal changes in electricity supply or demand. However, they still require significant discharge power-capacity to handle large spikes in demand caused by weather events.
> 
> These long-duration storage technologies could serve a dual purpose, providing the necessary short-term storage solutions with their existing power-capacity, making it more challenging for short-term storage technology to further cut system costs.
> 
> In regions dominated by wind or solar power, the most cost-effective setups included ample power-capacity from long-duration storage to meet short-term needs as well, so adding short-term storage didnâ€™t significantly lower overall system costs.
> 
> Therefore, in electric systems that depend on wind and solar energy, considering social and geographic limitations, long-duration storage could cost-effectively deliver services typically provided by short-term storage technologies.
