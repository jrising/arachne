> In python, how can I build up a pandas data frame one row at a time in a loop? I'll be looking at various objects (let's say they're just in a list) and extracting various values that go into different rows of the final data frame as I go.

> You can certainly build up a pandas DataFrame one row at a time. A common pattern is to start with an empty DataFrame and then append DataFrames with single rows to it. However, appending Pandas DataFrame inside a loop can lead to poor performance. It's more efficient to construct a list of dictionaries and then create a DataFrame from that.

>     # This is a made-up example, replace with your own logic
>     value1 = len(obj)
>     value2 = obj.lower()
>     
>     data.append({
>         'column1': value1,
>         'column2': value2
>     })
>     
> df = pd.DataFrame(data)

> In this approach, each object in your list gets turned into a dictionary that maps column names to values, and these dictionaries are collected into a list. Finally, the DataFrame is created in one step from this list of dictionaries.

> This construction method is significantly faster than appending rows one at a time to a DataFrame, and you would usually notice a performance difference as the size of your data increases.
