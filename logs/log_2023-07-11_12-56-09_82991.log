> I would like to add a base map layer in QGIS, particularly one that shows some ocean bathymetry, but other interesting features are welcome. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> To add a basemap layer in QGIS, the easiest approach is to use a plugin called `QuickMapServices` which allows you to easily add a variety of basemaps. Here is a step-by-step explanation:
> 
> 1. **Install the QuickMapServices Plugin**: Open the QGIS desktop application. Click on **Plugins** in the menu, then **Manage and Install Plugins**. In the dialog box, type “QuickMapServices” in the search bar and then select Install. 
> 
> 2. **Add The Basemap Layer**: Once the plugin is installed, you can add a basemap by going to **Web** in the main menu, then **QuickMapServices**, and then choosing from a variety of basemaps in the **Contributed Pack**. If you need ocean bathymetry, `GEBCO_2019` could be a good option, and it's present under **QuickMapServices** > **Contributed Services**.
> 
> 3. **Manipulate The Layer Display**: You can change the visibility, display order, and opacity of the basemap layer in the **Layers Panel**. You can also right-click on the layer for additional options. 
> 
> Please note that you'll need an internet connection to stream the basemaps through QuickMapService.
> 
> If you can't find the `GEBCO_2019` layer or if you're interested in other bathymetric data, you might look into the `NOAA Bathymetry` services, which could be added via a `WMS` (Web Map Service) link. Those services could be accessed via the 'Add WMS/WMTS Layer' under the Layer menu.
> 
> Remember, you should carefully consider the appropriateness of each base map layer for your specific context and how you handle any inherent uncertainties when drawing conclusions based on these layers.
