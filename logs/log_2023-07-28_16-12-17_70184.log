**assistant**:
> To estimate the cost of operating an 8 CPU computer at 100% capacity, we need to consider two main factors: the power consumption of the computer and the average cost of electricity in the US.
> 
> 1. **Power Consumption**: This can vary considerably depending on the model and type of CPU, other system components, and how efficient the overall system is. However, a reasonable estimate for a high-end workstation with 8 CPUs might be around 1,500 watts (or 1.5 kilowatt). This is an inflated estimate and the actual consumption might be lower.
> 
> 2. **Cost of Electricity**: As of 2021, the US Energy Information Administration reports that the average electricity cost in the US is about 13.2 cents per kilowatt-hour.
> 
> Assuming the computer is running 24 hours a day:
> 
> - The daily energy use is: 1.5 kW * 24 hours = 36 kWh
> - The daily cost is: 36 kWh * $0.132/kWh = $4.75
> - The monthly cost is: $4.75/day * 30 days = $142.5
> - The annual cost is: $142.5/month * 12 months = $1,710
> 
> It's important to note that this is a simplification. Actual costs may be higher or lower depending on the specific computer system, local electricity rates, and actual CPU usage. Also, this does not consider any energy-efficient power management features that modern computers often use to reduce power consumption when the CPU is not in demand.
> 
> So, to answer your question, the rough estimation of cost would be about $1,710 annually. But again, remember that it could vary widely based on the factors mentioned.
