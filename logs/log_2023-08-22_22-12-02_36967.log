**assistant**:
> The U.S. government provides a variety of data at the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code level. This granularity allows for detailed, sector-specific analysis. Here are the major types of data provided:
> 
> 1. **Employment Data**: Provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), this data includes employment, hours, and earnings data organized by industry.
> 
> 2. **Economic Data**: Provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), this data includes GDP by industry, input-output data, annual industry accounts data, and more.
> 
> 3. **Census Data**: Census Bureau provides economic census data every 5 years, with detailed industry breakdowns. This includes information about the number of establishments, sales/receipts/revenue, payroll, and number of employees.
> 
> 4. **Business Dynamics Statistics**: This dataset from the Census Bureau includes metrics such as number of firms, number of establishments, employment, job creation and destruction by firm age and size.
> 
> 5. **Trade Data**: The U.S. International Trade Commission provides import and export data by NAICS codes.
> 
> 6. **County Business Patterns**: Annual series that provides subnational economic data by industry, including the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll.
> 
> 7. **Environmental Data**: The EPA provides data on emissions and waste production by NAICS codes as well.
> 
> Please remember data availability highly depends on the specific NAICS code level. Data becomes less detailed as you descend to more specific industry levels (from 2-digit to 6-digit codes). The most data is available at the 2-digit level (general industry groups), and less is available as you get to the 6-digit level (more specific industry sub-sectors).
