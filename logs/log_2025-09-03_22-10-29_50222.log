>  abstract = {Climate change is generating demonstrable harm around the world. Political and legal efforts have sought to associate climate impacts with specific emissions, including in recent international policy discussion of Loss and Damage (L&D). However, no quantitative definition of L&D exists, nor does there exist a framework for linking specific emissions to specific damages. Here we develop such a framework, linking it explicitly to recent efforts to calculate the social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), and demonstrate its use in a variety of applications. We calculate that future damages from past emissions, one component of L&D, are at least an order of magnitude larger than historical damages from the same emissions, a more commonly discussed component of L&D: 1 ton of CO2 emitted in 1990 causes $4 in global cumulative discounted damages by 2020 and an additional $327 in discounted damages through 2100 (2% discount rate). These estimates of past and future damages from marginal emissions can be used to calculate L&D for a range of specific emitting activities: for instance, an individual taking one long-haul flight every year for the past decade will generate ~$5500 in damages through 2100, the emissions associated with multiple oil majors between 1988-2015 have already caused $50-200B of cumulative global economic damage by 2020, and CO2 emissions in the US since 1990 have caused  ~$2T in global damage through 2020, with India ($293B) and Brazil ($167B) being harmed the most. Carbon removal offers an alternative to transfer payments for settling L&D, but we show that it becomes increasingly ineffective in limiting damages as the delay between emission and recapture increases.},

> This report presents an analysis to quantify the economic damages associated with carbon emissions from seven leading investor-owned oil and gas companies since the signing of the Paris Agreement. The emissions data are sourced from the Carbon Majors Database, and the corresponding damages are calculated using the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). These damages are then reverse-discounted to 2025, providing a present-day valuation of their historical emissions impact.

> \section{Methodology}
> The analysis involves the following steps:
> \begin{enumerate}
>     \item \textbf{Social Cost of Carbon Estimation:} Using a quadratic model, the SCC values between 2020 and 2080 are estimated and then extrapolated to provide values for each year from 2010 to 2100.
> 
>     \item \textbf{Emissions Data:} The emissions data are filtered for major companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP, TotalEnergies, Eni, and OMV, focusing on emissions from 2016 onwards. Missing emissions data for 2024 and 2025 are extrapolated from available values.
> 
>     \item \textbf{Economic Damage Calculation:} The annual emissions are multiplied by the respective year's SCC to determine the yearly economic damage associated with each company's emissions. The damages are then converted to present value terms using the GDP deflator.
> 
>     \item \textbf{Reverse-Discounting:} The damages have been adjusted to 2025 using a GDP deflator \cite{source1}. The methodological approach for reverse-discounting follows the framework presented by Burke et al. in their working paper on linking specific emissions to damages \cite{source2}.

**user**:

> 
> \section{Methodology}
> The analysis involves the following steps:
> \begin{enumerate}
>     \item \textbf{Social Cost of Carbon Estimation:} A quadratic regression model is used to estimate the SCC values over the years. Specifically, the model is specified as:
> 
>     \begin{equation}
>     \log(\text{scc}_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{year}_t + \beta_2 \cdot \text{year}_t^2 + \epsilon_t
>     \end{equation}
> 
>     where $t$ represents the year and $\epsilon_t$ is the error term. The predicted SCC values are then exponentiated to yield estimates of SCC in USD per metric ton of CO$_2$. We generate predictions for each year from 2010 to 2100 based on this model.
> 
>     \item \textbf{Emissions Data Handling:} Emissions data for the selected companies are filtered for emissions after 2015. To address gaps in emissions reporting for 2024 and 2025, we apply a conservative approach where emissions are capped at the last recorded value for 2023 and are linearly extrapolated to these future years, ensuring that no company report higher emissions than those reported prior.
> 
>     \item \textbf{Economic Damage Calculation:} The annual emissions are multiplied by the respective year's SCC to determine the yearly economic damage associated with each company's emissions. 
> 
>     \item \textbf{GDP Deflator Assumptions:} The damages have been adjusted to reflect values in 2025 using the GDP deflator sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis \cite{source1}. For conservatism, we do not account for any further inflation beyond what is reported for 2024. 
> 
>     \item \textbf{Reverse-Discounting:} The resulting economic damages are reverse-discounted to 2025. The methodology for this approach relies on the framework presented by Burke et al. in their working paper on linking specific emissions to damages \cite{source2}.
