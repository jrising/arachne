> As Thanksgiving approaches, I would like to take this warm holiday as an appropriate opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for your invaluable guidance and support in various aspects of my life this year. I once came across a saying in a Ph.D. guidance handbook: “A Ph.D. journey is about picking up an advisor whose scholarship you admire, and whom you like personally.” You have exemplified this ideal, and you have been—and will always remain—an inspiring role model to me.

> I am deeply grateful for your guidance in leading me into the field of hydrogen energy research. This rare and forward-looking field stands at the forefront of innovation, offering a scholar a unique and enduring opportunity to dedicate himself to work that yields significant rewards across academia, industry, and society. I am also thankful for the opportunities you have provided to strengthen my academic skills through projects in agricultural economics. From collecting and processing data to analyzing it, these experiences have been instrumental in preparing me for future challenges and advancing my growth as an independent researcher.

> Lastly, I would also like to thank you for your  weekly academic mentorship and genuine care in my daily life. I deeply appreciate your kindness and patience, which have given me great encouragement and support throughout my journey. I am also beginning to learn small talk and explore aspects of American culture, which will help me engage confidently in academic discussions in other settings as well.
