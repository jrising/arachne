> Community Climate Shift is a groundbreaking initiative designed to transform how communities and local governments work together to ensure that new building performance standards, or other decarbonization policies, implemented by cities and states contribute to a Just Transition and reflect community priorities. In 2024, IMT was awarded a $5M grant from the Department of Energy to apply the principles of Community Climate Shift in nine cities and states. The federal funding cannot be used for community organizations, so IMT and Community Climate Shift participants fundraise from philanthropic sources to support those groups.
> Staff from the Institute for Market Transformation and the People’s Climate Innovation Center identified possible community partners through a social change ecosystem mapping process and submitted recommendations to the CCS Steering Committee for alignment. The Steering Committee is a diverse group of community-based organizations that comprise our Building Equity in Climate Solutions and Equitable Decarbonization Collaborators. Community partners are as follows: Local Clean Energy Alliance, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, People for Community Recovery, Bridging the Gap, ISAIAH, Alliance for Affordable Energy, Community Builders Network, Washington Interfaith Network, PODER, and POWER Interfaith.
> In 2025, we will solidify each government and CBO’s scope of work, then help them move forward on the Spectrum of Community Engagement to Ownership as they make progress on their policy goals. "

> New York Community Trust (NYCT) could support the work Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) is doing on the Community Climate Shift (CCS) initiative in various ways. Here are a few suggestions:
> 
> 1. **Direct Funding:** NYCT could provide direct grants to support the community-based organizations (CBOs) involved in the CCS initiative. This assistance can be particularly crucial since the $5M Department of Energy grant cannot be used for community organizations.
> 
> 2. **Network Building:** NYCT has a vast network of partners and donors. They could use this network to connect IMT with potential partners, funders, or collaborators to expand the reach and impact of the CCS initiative.
> 
> 3. **Technical Assistance:** NYCT has a history of providing technical assistance to its grantees. They could offer such support to help CBOs or governments refine their scope of work, or to assist with fund mobilization, strategic planning, or other areas of empowerment.
> 
> 4. **Policy Advocacy:** NYCT could leverage its influence to advocate for favorable policies or regulations. This advocacy could include promoting the efficient design and regulation of buildings to reduce carbon emissions, or pushing for legislative changes to allow federal funding to support community organizations.
> 
> 5. **Knowledge Dissemination:** NYCT could also assist in publicizing the work of IMT and the partnering CBOs through its communication outlets, helping elevate their profiles, and highlight their accomplishments in a broader sphere.
> 
> 6. **Endorsement and Alliance Building:** A public endorsement of the CCS initiative by NYCT could further enhance the image of the initiative, attracting more funds and creating momentum for policy change. Building alliances with other foundations or trusts can bring additional resources to the table.
> 
> No matter which approach NYCT takes, their support could significantly bolster the CCS initiative and help it succeed in its commendable mission towards just transition and community-decided decarbonization policies.
