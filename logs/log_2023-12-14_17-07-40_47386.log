**user**:
> In a faculty appointment, what does 50% research, 50% teaching mean?
**assistant**:
> In a faculty appointment, when a position is described as being 50% research and 50% teaching, it means that your responsibilities and time are meant to be divided evenly between research and teaching commitments. This is also sometimes referred to as your "effort allocation".
> 
> In the *research* portion of the job:
> 
> 1. You may be expected to develop and carry out independent research projects, often with the aim of publishing your results in academic journals.
> 2. You may also be tasked with securing research funding through grants or other sources.
> 3. Supervising graduate student research may also fall into this category.
> 
> In the *teaching* portion:
> 
> 1. You will be responsible for designing and delivering course content to undergraduate or graduate students. This could include giving lectures, setting and grading assignments, holding office hours, and managing teaching assistants.
> 2. You also may be asked to serve as an advisor for students or contribute to administrative tasks in the department, such as curriculum development or departmental committees.
> 
> Bear in mind that the specific division of duties can vary between different institutions and departments. For example, in other roles, the percentage may be divided among research, teaching, and service (administrative duties, community outreach, etc.). Furthermore, these percentages should ideally reflect how you spend your time, but in actuality, academic work often doesn't neatly fit into these categories. Be sure to get clarity during application or negotiation processes.
**user**:
> How many courses per semester would 50% teaching imply?
**assistant**:
> The number of courses per semester that a 50% teaching appointment implies can vary depending on several factors, including the institution's workload policies and the credit hours assigned to each course. However, I can provide a general guideline to give you an idea.
> 
> In a typical semester, a full-time faculty member might teach around 3 to 4 courses, although this can vary widely depending on the institution and discipline. For a 50% teaching appointment, you would allocate half of your time to teaching. 
> 
> If we assume that a full-time teaching load is around 4 courses per semester, a 50% teaching appointment would then suggest a teaching load of about 2 courses per semester. This could mean teaching one course in one semester and two courses in another, or teaching one course every semester.
> 
> However, it's important to note that workload allocation can be flexible and can vary depending on the specific requirements and expectations of your institution, department, and individual circumstances. It's best to consult with your department or supervisor to determine the precise teaching load associated with a 50% teaching appointment at your institution.
