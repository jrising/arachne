> Yes, a geodatabase can include gridded information. In fact, one of the primary ways that raster data (e.g., satellite imagery, digital elevation models, climate models) is stored and managed in GIS systems is through the use of gridded data structures such as raster datasets or raster catalogs within a geodatabase.
> 
> A raster dataset is a single raster layer that can be added to a geodatabase and can include multiple bands (e.g., red, green, blue) or channels. A raster catalog is a collection of raster datasets that can be organized by theme, such as elevation or land cover type.
> 
> In addition to raster data, a geodatabase can also store vector data such as points, lines, and polygons, as well as tabular data such as attribute tables. This allows for the integration of different data types and formats into a single geodatabase, making it a powerful tool for managing, analyzing, and visualizing complex spatial information.
