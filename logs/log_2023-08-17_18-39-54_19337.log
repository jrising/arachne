> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters. Please write a paragraph about disposal sites. It is accompanied by a map with data with following source description:
> ---
> These data show the location of available and discontinued ocean disposal sites within U.S. waters. Contemporary ocean disposal sites generally accept clean dredged material (sediment) collected during navigation channel improvement projects. These projects are sponsored or regulated by federal and state agencies. The terminology and practices used in ocean disposal have changed considerably over time. The values in the Primary Use field in this database show some of that variability.

> In the paragraph, note the following:
> Within the planning area, there are:
>  - Two active disposal sites with primary use = Littoral Placement Area
>  - 3 discontinued disposal sites
> Nearby, there is a Municipal sewage sludge dump site, a dredged material disposal site, and a site designed by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) (so these are all potential uses).

> In the vicinity of the Delaware marine waters planning area, several ocean disposal sites, both active and deactivated, have significant relevance. Firstly, the area entails two ongoing disposal sites primarily utilized as Littoral Placement Areas. These sites typically receive clean sediment dredged during navigation channel enhancement programs sponsored or regulated by federal and state authorities. Secondly, there are also three discontinued disposal sites in this region, indicating a history of evolving practices and usage in the area. In the nearby region, a diverse array of other disposal sites further offers insight into potential uses. There is a Municipal sewage sludge dump site, signifying the disposal management of biosolids following wastewater treatment. Additionally, there is a dedicated site for the disposal of dredged material, ideally from marine and waterway operations. Finally, there exists a site designated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), indicating the potential for environment-conscious marine activities. These sites collectively underline the multifaceted practices in ocean disposal within and around the Delaware marine waters.
