> I am upgrading an old version MediaWiki. After the upgrade, I can still see my content in the `content` table, but all of the pages show up as "There is currently no text in this page." This is even the case with my single orphaned page-- it's name shows up on the orphaned pages list, but none of the content shows.

**assistant**:
> Your SQL statement's failure might indeed be related to an issue that arose during your MediaWiki upgrade, especially if the `rev_comment_id` is missing or is `0` in the database.

> MediaWiki has undergone a lot of database schema changes over the years. For example, in version 1.30, the `rev_comment` field in the `revision` table was replaced by a reference to the `comment` table. It seems from your SQL statement that an entry in the `revision` table is expected to match an existing entry in the `comment` table via the `rev_comment_id`. But if no matching row exists in the `comment` table (for example, if `rev_comment_id` is `0`), the join will fail to return rows.
> 
> In an ideal situation, there should be processes during the upgrade to migrate comments from the old field (if present) to the new `comment` table, and to update `rev_comment_id` accordingly. If this didn't happen properly, it could be the source of your problem.
> 
> To test this, you can try a modified version of your SQL statement, specifically excluding the comment join:
> 
> ```sql
> SELECT rev_id,
> rev_page,
> rev_timestamp,
> rev_minor_edit,
> rev_deleted,
> rev_len,
> rev_parent_id,
> rev_sha1,
> actor_rev_user.actor_user AS `rev_user`,
> actor_rev_user.actor_name AS `rev_user_text`,
> rev_actor,
> page_namespace,
> page_title,
> page_id,
> page_latest,
> page_is_redirect,
> page_len,
> user_name FROM `wiki_revision`
> 
> JOIN `wiki_actor` `actor_rev_user`

> 
> If the SQL statement returns rows, this would suggest that the issue lies with the `wiki_comment` table or the `rev_comment_id` value. The next step would be to investigate what happened during the MediaWiki upgrade process, specifically regarding how comments were migrated to the new table structure. 
> 
> Additionally, you could also check the maintenance scripts supplied with MediaWiki - in this case, `updateCommentTable.php` which should have helped to migrate comments to their new table. It might be worthwhile to rerun this script. The script is typically in the `/maintenance/archives` directory of your MediaWiki installation.
> 
> However, please perform a database backup before attempting any operations that may modify it.
> 
> If this doesn't resolve the issue, please provide me with more information about the steps you followed during the upgrade process, as well as any errors you might have encountered. It would also be helpful to know which versions of MediaWiki you upgraded from and currently have.
