**assistant**:
> Joining two dataframes in pandas when the names of the columns are not the same can be achieved using the `merge()` function. You will just need to specify which columns to use from each dataframe.
> 
> Here's the general syntax:
> 
> ```python
> df1_merged_df2 = df1.merge(df2, left_on='df1_column_name', right_on='df2_column_name', how='inner')
> ```
> 
> Where:
> - `df1` and `df2` are your dataframes.
> - `'df1_column_name'` is the name of the column to join on in the first dataframe.
> - `'df2_column_name'` is the name of the column to join on in the second dataframe.
> - `'inner'` is the type of join. You can also use `'outer'`, `'left'`, or `'right'`.
> 
> This will return a new dataframe that is the result of the merge operation.
> 
> For example, if you had two dataframes with different column names you want to join on:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # sample data
> df1 = pd.DataFrame({
>    'name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'],
>    'value': [1, 2, 3]
> })
> 
> df2 = pd.DataFrame({
>    'person': ['Joe', 'John', 'Jane'],
>    'score': [7, 8, 9]
> })
> 
> # merge dataframe
> df_joined = df1.merge(df2, left_on='name', right_on='person', how='inner')
> ```
> 
> The resulting dataframe, `df_joined`, should look like this:
> 
> ```
>    name  value person  score
> 0  John      1   John      8
> 1  Jane      2   Jane      9
> 2   Joe      3    Joe      7
> ```
> 
> Note that the merge operation includes both 'name' and 'person' columns with identical information. You might want to drop one of them post-merge:
> 
> ```python
> df_joined.drop('person', axis=1, inplace=True)
> ```
> 
> This will result in the dataframe:
> 
> ```
>    name  value  score
> 0  John      1      8
> 1  Jane      2      9
> 2   Joe      3      7
> ```
