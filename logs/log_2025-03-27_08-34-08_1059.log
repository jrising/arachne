> **Why I Want to Work at Thalo Labs**
> 
> My desire to join Thalo Labs is deeply rooted in a personal and professional commitment to sustainability. During the pandemic, I was struck by the discrepancy between expected and actual reductions in global emissions—a stark reminder of how critical our work in this area is. Dr. Brendan Hermalyn's journey resonates with me; his frustration with the sluggish pace of the energy transition inspires me to take action.
