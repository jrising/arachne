> Should I write "state of Delaware" or "State of Delaware"?
**assistant**:
> You should write "State of Delaware" because it is a proper noun referring to a specific state. Capitalizing "State" in this context is appropriate and follows standard conventions for names of government entities.
**user**:
> Should I write "sea level rise" or "sea-level rise"?
**assistant**:
> You should write "sea-level rise" with a hyphen. The hyphen helps clarify that "sea-level" functions as a compound adjective describing the noun "rise." This usage is common in scientific and environmental writing.
**user**:
> Referring to the State of Delaware, should I say, "There are many people in the State" or "There are many people in the state"?
**assistant**:
> You should say, "There are many people in the State." When referring to the specific "State of Delaware," "State" should be capitalized.
**user**:
> Does that also apply to a statement like such-and-such is a "critical pillar of the state's prosperity". So the State's prosperity?
**assistant**:
> In that case, you would use "the state's prosperity" in lowercase. When referring to a state in a general sense (like "state's prosperity"), itâ€™s common to use lowercase unless it's part of an official name. So, "the State of Delaware's prosperity" would be correct if you were mentioning the formal title. 
> 
> In summary:
> - **"the state's prosperity"** (general reference)
> - **"the State of Delaware's prosperity"** (formal title)
**user**:
> "anymore" or "any more"?
**assistant**:
> Use "anymore" when referring to time, as in "I don't live there anymore." Use "any more" when referring to quantity, as in "I can't eat any more." 
> 
> So, choose based on the context in which you are using it!
