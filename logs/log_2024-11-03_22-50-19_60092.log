> 1.1. The problem of the global fisheries commons
> A commons refers to a resource system that many users share [63,69].
> Although they are often conflated with open-access systems—and
> increasingly with common-pool resources (CPRs), following the work by
> Elinor Ostrom [43]—commons need not be either [19]. Open-access
> systems and CPRs can be understood as specialized types of commons
> (i.e., subsets). Open-access systems are defined by their lack of ownership
> or property rights, which precludes anyone from excluding others
> from accessing or appropriating the resource system. Whereas a CPR
> may or may not have defined property rights ascribed to it, it is difficult
> (but not impossible) to exclude others from benefiting from CPRs. The
> associated benefits are subtractable—that is, one person’s use necessarily
> depletes the available stock, thus making the appropriated unit
> unavailable to others [43,51]. The distinction is crucial because
> open-access systems and CPRs lead to different collective action problems
> and have different policy implications [19,45]. Specifically, when
> analyzing problems associated with the fisheries commons, one ought to
> exercise caution not to conflate fisheries governed under a CPR regime
> with open-access fisheries.
> The tragedy of the commons remains an influential analogy to
> describe the problem affecting global fisheries (Van Long & [75]). The
> idea is broadly credited to Garrett Hardin [24]. Hardin’s bleak conclusions
> were refuted by natural resource economists, who showed that
> self-governing resource users can successfully avert the tragedy [2,43].
> Resource users implement a variety of rules to monitor their resource
> extraction rates and exclude outsiders from exploiting the resource
> system. They do so by developing mutual monitoring, sanctioning, and
> conflict resolution mechanisms in case of violations. Thus, the tragedy is
> neither inevitable nor unsolvable, as resource users create and adapt
> diverse institutions to overcome their dilemmas.
> Moreover, the creation of institutions is endogenous to the economic
> system and can occur in response to a perceived tragedy [2]. Since the
> commons are jointly owned (by definition) and investments to design
> institutions are typically large, some form of collective action is necessary
> to manage the commons. Thus, the management is a governance
> challenge involving the multilevel collective action problems of (i)
> creating a system of rules that allow, prescribe, or proscribe certain
> actions for specific actors and (ii) monitoring and enforcing the rules to
> distribute the costs and benefits to different actors. Such rules can be
> created through a top-down assignment, a bottom-up system of property
> rights and voluntary exchange, or some hybrid form that combines
> features of each [56,74]. The design of institutions (i.e., the institutional
> choice) has important implications for the sustainability of a resource
> system and the likelihood of a tragedy.
> Despite scholarship disproving the inevitability of the tragedy of the
> commons, the notion tends to resurface in various forms in contemporary
> global commons discourse. It is easy to see the appeal of the analogy.

> individuals’ maximizing their private gains and/or minimizing their
> private costs. The logic suggests that when rationally self-interested
> individuals encounter a commons, they will attempt to appropriate
> the private benefits from it but will try to ‘socialize’ the costs of maintaining
> and preserving the resource system as much as possible. They

> purview of any government, fishers are free to extract unlimited quantities
> of fish, with the only limits posed by technology, gear, and the
> environment. Even in inland systems that are sufficiently large, more

> rational fishers to race to overexploit the resource [38]. Empirical evidence

> 2. Global challenges as nested collective action problems
> One critical insight from Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom’s work on
> natural resource management is that large-scale externalities spanning
> multiple governmental jurisdictions should be viewed as nested collective
> action problems rather than singular problems [48,49,55,59]. According
> to Ostrom, externalities are nested if one decision-making unit’s
> choices and actions produce costs or benefits for other units at different
> scales ([49], p. 356).
> Global externalities, such as those involving global fisheries, fit the
> above description. They involve different countries, states, cities, municipalities,
> cultures, firms, and organizations. Actions of each unit (a
> fisher, firm, or government) generate costs and benefits that percolate to
> other units. For example, once in effect, an environmental policy targeting
> large-scale fisheries in Nova Scotia province in Canada will
> immediately affect fishing communities in Maine in the United States.
> Similarly, because of their ‘fugitive’ (i.e., mobile or migratory) nature
> and the interconnectedness of their habitats, poor management of a
> lobster fishery by communities in southern Maine will directly affect the
> size and health of the available stocks in northern Maine [64]. Highly
> migratory species, such as tuna, billfish, and sharks, can swim between
> the high seas and areas demarcated as exclusive economic zones (EEZs)
> by different jurisdictions, making them highly susceptible to overexploitation
> [37]. Such species can be affected by decisions and actions
> taken by governments and private actors from distant regimes. Even the
> choices made by secondary actors—such as processors, marketers,
> supporting industries, and consumers—have implications for the overall
> sustainability of fisheries [77].
> Nestedness is a feature that is not unique to large-scale externalities

> P. Paniagua and V. Rayamajhee
> [56]. A society itself can be described as a nested system. There are small
> social orders embedded within other larger social orders. For example,
> [34] conceptualizes nested arrangements as cooperative systems that
> encourage the autonomous functioning of smaller, more exclusive units
> operating within broadly agreed-upon principles. Thus, the nestedness

> smaller jurisdictional units can often govern themselves insofar as the
> problem does not spill over to neighboring jurisdictions. When the

> require clustering at multiple centers.
> For tractability and other reasons, analysts and policymakers often

> and tend to resurface in other forms, such as high implementation costs,
> high noncompliance rates, and even societal instability.
> Consequently, miscalculations of the costs and benefits become
> inevitable because the nested nature of specific socioeconomic and
> ecological problems is ignored, thereby generating unintended and

> 4.1. Market-based solutions: individual transferable quotas
> One widely implemented market-based solution to the global fisheries
> commons problem is the individual transferable quotas (ITQs)
> system. Although implementing ITQs requires a substantial governmental
> role, ITQs rely on price mechanisms and voluntary transactions
> between buyers and sellers in the open market. ITQs work as follows:
> Scientists assist governmental authorities in setting the annual allowable
> catch, which is equal to the efficient catch based on the specific fishery’s
> natural regenerative capacity.
> Governments then either allocate or auction off catch quotas to
> fishers and companies. The catch quotas serve as tradable property
> rights that allow holders to extract a specified quantity of fish per year.
> The rights holders may extract the fish themselves or buy and sell their
> quotas in the secondary market [69,78]. Because the total quotas do not
> exceed the fishery’s regenerative capacity, ITQs help to ensure that
> fishing levels are sustainable. ITQs are also welfare maximizing because
> they use a price system to direct resources to where they are most
> valued.
> Seventeen countries—including Australia, Canada, Iceland, and New
> Zealand—have implemented different forms of ITQs in about 150 fisheries
> [41]. Of those countries, New Zealand uses ITQs to manage its
> entire commercial fishing industry ([41], p. 91). Mounting evidence
> suggests that ITQs render fishing less dangerous, increase supply, and
> improve the quality and quantity of fish for all consumers. ITQs can also
> be self-enforcing since fishers on site have incentives to take policing,
> monitoring, and reporting roles to ensure that everyone respects the
> quotas. Because each fisher is a partial owner of the fish stock and
> benefits from an increase in its value, fishers have an interest in properly
> managing the fishery to preserve the quantity and quality of the fish
> stock. ITQs’ tradability guarantees that fishers who wish to catch more
> than their originally allotted quotas may purchase larger quotas in the
> open market rather than resorting to more costly and potentially
> dangerous measures. Even though this system gets the label of “privatization,”

> 5. Concluding remarks
> Analyses of the problem of global fisheries depletion suffer from the
> panacea problem [81]. Thus far, significant scholarly efforts have been
> expended in establishing the superiority of a specific solution and in
> refuting alternative solutions that are deemed suboptimal. As a result,
> the problem has been inappropriately aggregated, homogenized, and
> simplified, and the institutional context has been stripped away to
> comply with the assumptions and conclusions of academic exercises.
> Simple and elegant solutions derived from such exercises conducted
> within an institutional void, when implemented in the real world, either
> do not work or generate counterproductive results.
> This paper offers an analytical alternative to move away from the
> panacea trap. Rather than viewing the global fisheries commons as a
> singular problem, we argue that it is a nested set of collective action
> problems of diverse scales and features, organized in different horizontal
> and vertical levels and affecting different parties across overlapping
> jurisdictions. Under this alternative framework, our perspective emphasizes
> the complementarity of diverse solutions at different levels.
> Market-based approaches such as ITQs that rely on price signals have
> proven their efficacies in many fisheries worldwide. However, their
> applicability is limited to contexts where effective and accountable political
> institutions exist. Where such institutions are absent, ITQs can
> serve as extractive tools that governments and external entities can use
> to remove de facto property rights from indigenous communities. The
> role of governments is also critical in addressing coordination challenges
> at the higher level. One achievable government action could be
> rescinding fisheries subsidies, which have led to massive declines in
> fisheries stock worldwide. Finally, we discuss the importance of
> community-based solutions in addressing the problem at the local level
> in a manner that can promote concerted efforts to solve the challenge of
> governing the “global fisheries commons” by partitioning it into more
> manageable local problems.

> Can you suggest some multiple-choice questions for a short quiz to check that they absorbed the reading?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here are some multiple-choice questions that cover key concepts from the article "Governing the global fisheries commons" by Pablo Paniagua and Veeshan Rayamajhee. These questions can help assess your students' understanding of the material:
> 
> 1. **What primary challenge does the article identify in addressing the depletion of global fisheries stock?**
>    - A. Lack of technological innovation in fisheries.
>    - B. Mischaracterization of global fisheries as either a singular or overly localized problem.
>    - C. Insufficient scientific understanding of fish behavior.
>    - D. Inadequate support from international organizations like the WTO.
> 
> 2. **According to the article, which economist’s insights are used to frame the depletion of the global fisheries?**
>    - A. Garrett Hardin
>    - B. Elinor Ostrom
>    - C. Adam Smith
>    - D. Paul Krugman
> 
> 3. **What concept does the article emphasize as necessary for the governance of global fisheries commons?**
>    - A. Command-and-control regulation.
>    - B. A universal, one-size-fits-all policy solution.
>    - C. Nested governance challenges requiring multi-tiered governance.
>    - D. Privatization of all marine resources.
> 
> 4. **The article mentions Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs). What is their primary purpose?**
>    - A. To increase the profitability of high-seas fishing for large corporations.
>    - B. To allocate fishing rights to create economic efficiency and reduce overfishing.
>    - C. To eliminate all governmental influence over fisheries management.
>    - D. To support local fishing communities without any regulations.
> 
> 5. **What is one major criticism mentioned in the article regarding fishing subsidies?**
>    - A. They are too little to make any difference to the fishing industry.
>    - B. They help small-scale fishers in developing countries.
>    - C. They lead to increased overfishing by creating economic incentives for more significant catches.
>    - D. They generally reduce the costs of fish for consumers.
> 
> 6. **How does the article propose addressing the tragedy of the fisheries commons specifically related to the high seas?**
>    - A. Complete closure of the high seas to all fishing activities.
>    - B. Increasing governmental subsidies to support sustainable fishing.
>    - C. Developing a polycentric approach involving multiple stakeholders at various levels.
>    - D. Focusing solely on the development of marine protected areas (MPAs).
> 
> 7. **What role do community-based approaches play in the article's proposed solutions?**
>    - A. They are considered irrelevant in the face of large-scale international issues.
>    - B. They provide localized knowledge and monitoring, creating effective self-governing systems.
>    - C. They focus primarily on technological solutions for overfishing.
>    - D. They replace government interventions with private sector initiatives.
> 
> 8. **According to the article, why is there a fundamental issue with applying "panacea" solutions to the fisheries commons problem?**
>    - A. Panacea solutions often single out market-driven approaches, ignoring community roles.
>    - B. They oversimplify complex, nested governance challenges and ignore local conditions.
>    - C. They tend to focus on economic growth rather than sustainability.
>    - D. Solutions are effective only in regions with adequate enforcement capabilities.
> 
> These questions aim to cover the article's main points about governance challenges, proposed solutions, and critical perspectives on conventional methods of addressing fisheries depletion.
