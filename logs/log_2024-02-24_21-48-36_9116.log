**user**:
> I am building a model ship, and I have been asked to "apply a coat of pore-filling lacquer" to the deck. I do not have anything called that. I did get a kit from the same company, though, and it came with "thin", "medium", and "high" viscosity adhesive. Would one of those be appropriate?
**assistant**:
> Pore-filling lacquer is a type of finish that fills in the tiny pits and pores in wood to give it a smooth, shiny, and clean appearance. The "thin", "medium", and "high" viscosity adhesives provided in your kit are not a direct substitute for this since their primary role is to bind or glue wooden parts together, rather than provide a finish to the surface.
> 
> While some modelers might use a high viscosity adhesive to fill in small gaps, this is usually done for small repairs or for parts of the model where aesthetics isn't a primary concern, not for overall finishing.
> 
> To achieve the desired result, I recommend you acquire an actual pore-filling lacquer or a clear wood filler from a nearby hardware store or online. They are best for creating a smooth finish and can be found in various sheens, from matte to high gloss, depending on your preference.
> 
> Remember that application and use can vary between products, so make sure to read the instructions on the lacquer product you choose. In general, application involves brushing on the lacquer, allowing it to dry, and then sanding or buffing it to the desired finish.
