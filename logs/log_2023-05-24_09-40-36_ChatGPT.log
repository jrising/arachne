> Do the multipliers that are used in I/O models (I believe US ones are developed by the US government) represent the effect of an additional marginal dollar or the effect of an average dollar?

> Input-output (I/O) models are used in economics to analyze the relationships between different sectors within an economy. These models, including the ones developed by the US government, help to understand how changes in one industry can impact others.

> The multipliers you mention are part of these I/O models. Specifically, they represent the cumulative impacts of an additional (marginal) dollar spent in a particular sector of the economy.

> When we say "marginal", it refers to the change resulting from a small or incremental adjustment to the current state of affairs. So, in the context of I/O models, a multiplier measures the effect of an additional dollar of demand for a specific sector's output on the economy as a whole.
> 
> This effect is not averaged across all dollars spent in the sector but is specific to an additional dollar. The multiplier takes into account both the direct effects (changes in the sector receiving the initial dollar) and the indirect and induced effects (changes in other sectors caused by re-spending of the initial dollar). Therefore, the multipliers represent the total effect per additional dollar spent.
> 
> It's also important to note that these multipliers are estimates based on certain assumptions and the specific structure of the I/O model, and may not perfectly predict the impact of an additional dollar spent in real-world scenarios. It is always important to consider the limitations and assumptions of these models when using them for decision-making or forecasting.
