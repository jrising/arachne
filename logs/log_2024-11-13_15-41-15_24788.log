> Dear Professor Rising,

> I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out because your work on the effects of climate change within social-environmental systems strongly aligns with my academic interests and goals. I graduated with First Class honors in Maritime Management Technology from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, and I am currently applying to the M.S. program in Marine Policy at the University of Delaware. It would be a privilege to contribute to your research on resource management, particularly in climate resilience within fisheries and food systems.
> 
> 
> While exploring your research website, I was particularly impressed by how you seamlessly blend empirical data with complex systems modeling to address pressing environmental challenges. Your work on resilience strategies in fisheries and coastal communities resonated deeply with me. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on The Impact of COVID-19 in the Maritime Industry: Pre and Post Era, which gave me firsthand insight into the resilience challenges faced by maritime and coastal sectors. I conducted descriptive and statistical analysis using methods such as t-tests and ANOVA and based on all findings, I recommended the development of more adaptable and resilient systems to better withstand future disruptions. Seeing these disruptions emphasized the importance of adaptive, community-centered strategies in resource management and these are principles reflected in your work.
