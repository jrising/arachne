> The emission of carbon dioxide clearly is an externality. We burn fossil fuel to generate

> Emissions are thus unintentional (even if intrinsic to the process; see Section 2.1). Climate
> change does affect the welfare of people all over the world (cf. Chapter 6). These people are
> not compensated by the emitters of carbon dioxide.
> In the presence of externalities, government intervention can improve welfare and is thus
> justified. The best intervention is the Pigou tax, named after Arthur Pigou, professor of political
> economy at University of Cambridge in the 1920s. The Pigou tax internalizes the externality.

> done. This restores the Pareto optimum.
> 4.2 Direct regulation*
> The regulator has many ways to affect em1ss10ns. Each of these instruments has different
> properties, which makes them more or less suitable for solving some problems than others.
> Direct regulation was successful, it made the career of current environmental
> leaders, and so it is still popular.
> Direct regulation is probably the most common form of environmental policy. Direct regulation
> has been highly successful in the OECD. In the 1960s and 1970s, the environment in
> Europe and North America was filthy. It is no longer. The clean-up of the environment was
> largely done by direct regulation. This means that environmental regulators have a substantial
> amount of experience with these instruments, while senior regulators fondly recall the past
> successes of direct regulation. Even though times have changed and current environmental
> problems are different, environmental regulation lags behind. Furthermore, direct regulation
> allows bureaucrats to expand bureaucracies, as is in their interest.
> Direct regulation is the government telling people and companies what
> (not) to do, and how (not) to do it.
> Direct regulation is also known as command and control. Essentially, the regulator goes in
> and tells households and companies what (not) to do and how (not) to do it. The regulator
> would be able to come up with sensible instructions if she has detailed knowledge of the regulated
> activity, which requires that there are either only a small number of agents or a small number
> of technologies in use. Direct regulation is essentially a one-size-fits-all solution. Regulation is
> homogenous because of capacity constraints within the regulator, and because administrative
> fairness demands that everyone is treated the same. This is fine unless there is substantial
> heterogeneity among the regulated.
> Direct regulation works fine if there are few, similar sources of emissions. It
> does not work for greenhouse gases.
> There are different forms of direct regulation:
> • The regulator may proscribe or forbid certain inputs into the production process, or put
> standards on the amount of input used.
> 1 If the externality is positive no Pareto optimum is reached either, as the third party could sacrifice part of
> her windfall to incentivize more of the externality.
> • The regulator may proscribe or forbid certain technologies used in the production process,
> or put standards on performance.
> • The regulator may put limits on selected outputs of the production process, or put requirements
> on the products.
> • The regulator may put limits on the timing of certain activities, or on their location.
> For example, the US government have mandated that car fuel should be a blend of petrol
> and bioethanol. Car fuel may not contain lead. Car engines have to be equipped with catalytic
> convertors and meet fuel-efficiency standards. Power plants may only emit a certain amount
> of sulphur. Toys for infants may not contain carcinogenic material. Planes are not allowed to
> take off or land between 11 pm and 6 am. New buildings cannot be built in nature reserves.
> CFCs may not be made, sold, bought or used.
> 4.3 Market-based instruments*
> Taxes, subsidies and tradable permits reward emission reduction, but the
> decision whether and how is private.
> Market-based or incentive-compatible policy instruments are the main alternative to direct
> regulation. Taxes and subsidies are the oldest instruments. With a tax, there is a charge, levy
> or penalty for every unit of the offending substance (or a proxy) used, produced, or emitted.
> With a subsidy, there is monetary reward for every unit of the offending substance not used,
> not produced, or not emitted.
> In the short run, taxes and subsidies have the same effect on, say, emissions. With a
> subsidy, every tonne of emissions avoided will bring a reward. With a tax, every tonne of
> emissions avoided will reduce the tax burden, that is, bring a reward.
> Taxes and subsidies have different distributional effects. With a tax, money flows from
> households and companies to the government. With a subsidy, money flows from the government
> to households and companies.
> Taxes increase costs, subsidies reduce costs. Over time, subsidies thus lead
> to an expansion of the polluting sector.
> Because of that, taxes and subsidies also have different effects on emissions in the medium
> run. An emission tax increases the average cost of doing business in a particular sector. Investment
> flows elsewhere and the emitting sector shrinks (relative to what its size would have been
> without the tax). An emission avoidance subsidy reduces the average cost of doing business
> in that sector. Additional investment flows there, and the emitting sector expands (relative to
> what its size would have been without the subsidy).
> Tradable permits are a more recent addition to the set of instruments available to the
> regulator. With tradable permits, the regulator sets an overall cap on consumption, production,
> or emissions. Let us focus on the last. The overall emissions cap is then split into units and
> each emitter receives a certain amount of permits to emit. So far, this is direct regulation.
> However, if a company finds that it has too few permits, it may buy additional permits from a
> company that has too many.
> The price for emission permits that is formed on its market works just like a tax. For every
> unit of additional emissions, a company either has to buy an additional permit (which is a
> cost) or can sell fewer of the permits it holds ( which is a cost too). For every unit of emissions
> avoided, a company either can sell more permits (which is a benefit) or has to buy fewer permits
> in the market (which is a benefit too).
> The main advantage of market-based instruments is that the regulator does not specify how
> emissions are reduced. That decision is left to household and companies. The regulator does
> specify, however, that emissions are reduced.
> Box 4.1: Emissions trade in practice: US Northeast
> The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is an emission permit market covering
> Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York,
> Rhode Island, and Vermont for CO2 emissions from power generation within these nine
> states. All power-generating facilities with a capacity of 25 MW or greater are included,
> which is essentially all power generators. All permits are auctioned, with the proceeds
> going to programmes for energy efficiency and renewables. Permits are valid for a three
> year period, but can be banked for later periods. Exact regulations vary from state to
> state, but permits are traded freely between states.
> Emissions fell by 40% between 2005, when the market started, and 2013. Emissions
> are mandated to fall by a further 2.5% per year until 2020. Permit prices have varied
> between $2 and $7 per short ton of CO2, the price peak in 2015 coinciding with a
> downwards adjustment of the emissions cap. Prices are low because cheap shale gas
> outcompetes coal for power generation, and because the states each have initiatives to
> promote renewable electricity.
> Originally, New Jersey was also part of RGGI. It stopped issuing new emission permits
> in 2012, but committed to uphold the validity of permits issued before 2012. The
> other states continued to recognize New Jersey permits, including permits issued for the
> years 2012-14, even though New Jersey does not. This raised the emissions cap, but
> maintained the legal integrity of the cap. This demonstrates that an interjurisdictional
> permit market can cope with the departure of a member.
> New Jersey rejoined in 2018. Pennsylvania joined in 2022, North Carolina may soon.

> A target is met at its lowest possible cost if taxes, subsidies or tradable permits
> are used.
> The costs of emission reduction are uniform at the margin if taxes, subsidies or tradable
> permits are used. This is an important characteristic. Let us consider a social planner, who
> seeks to reduce emissions at a minimum cost to society:
> ( 4.1)
> n n
> where B are the total costs of emission reduction, Bn are the costs of company n, Rn are
> the emission reduction efforts of company n, and f3n are parameters, the unit cost of emission

> That is, least-cost emission reduction requires that all emitters face the same abatement cost

> set at the societal level and is thus the same for all emitters.
> The least-cost solution to meet a target is known as the cost-effective solution. Cost-efficacy
> is an optimum. A solution cannot be more cost-effective than another solution; it either is costeffective
> or it is not. Some people use the words "more cost-effective" as an "erudite" alternative
> to the word "cheaper", but in fact they demonstrate their lack of understanding of the meaning

> use the word "cost-efficiency" as a synonym for cost-efficacy. In fact, cost-efficiency is the dual
> of productive efficiency, and if you do not understand what that means, then you should not
> use the word cost-efficiency.2 Besides productive efficiency, we also care about allocative and
> cross-efficiency, which are captured by cost-efficacy if, as is usual in the context of climate

> 2Reminder: In the primal formulation, a company maximizes output subject to a constraint on production

> Box 4.2: Emissions trade in practice: California and Quebec
> Since 2013, California has had a market for greenhouse gas emission permits. It covers

> There is also a strategic reserve, 1 % of the total emission allocation in 2013 but eventually
> rising to 7%. If the permit price reaches defined thresholds ($40, 45, 50/tCO2e in 2013,

> to the California Air Resources Board to legitimize emissions-at around
> $22/tCOtCO 2e.The price fell to below $12/tCO 2e in late 2014. Permits traded around
> $15/tCO 2e in August 2017. These prices are much closer to the price floor than to the
> price ceiling, and prices are low too in the light of California's goal to reduce emissions
> by 15% between 2015 and 2020. Prices are low because California has a range of other
> policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Overlapping regulation increases the costs

> the price of emission permits.

> Box 4.3: Emissions trade in practice: China
> China has trialled emissions trading from 2011 on in the provinces of Guangdong and
> Hubei, and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen. Together,
> the seven pilot schemes cover about a third of all carbon dioxide emissions from China.
> The pilots are deliberately different so as to maximize learning. Since August 2021,
> there is also a national market, but Figure 4.1 shows that prices have yet to converge.
> A number of issues have emerged. First, China does not have a cap on emissions. If there
> were a cap on emissions, the number of emission permits would have followed trivially.
> Instead, China has a target for the emission intensity of the economy. The number of
> permits follows once GDP is known, but statistics on energy use and hence emissions
> typically become available before statistics on economic activity. The pilot schemes
> therefore tried absolute targets by economic sectors, combined emission intensity targets
> with projected GDP, or a mix of these two approaches.
> The pilot schemes cover the direct emissions from fossil fuel burned within the seven
> jurisdictions, plus the indirect emissions from electricity generated anywhere in China if
> that electricity is used within the covered jurisdiction. This is essentially a border tax
> adjustment for power trade, noting that the border is not an international one. This
> complicates target setting.
> The third issue is that energy markets in China are heavily regulated, if not owned and
> planned outright by city and provincial governments. Permit trade works by appealing
> to the animal spirits of private operators seeking profit. In China, electricity companies
> in particular operate by bureaucratic mandate. This makes it hard, if not impossible, to

> regulated, if not set by the local governments-and it is thus not possible to pass the
> costs of carbon onto the final users so as to induce them to save energy.
> Monitoring and enforcement are perhaps the biggest issues. Statistics of energy use and
> greenhouse emissions show large discrepancies in China. Different estimates can easily
> deviate by 30% or more. Companies are supposed to match their emissions to their
> permits, but this is difficult if emissions are not known with precision. Enforcement is

> Section 4.4 derives the condition for static efficiency: A uniform carbon price. The costs of

> margin. The Baumol condition follows from a cost-minimization problem, and the realization
> that the constraint is on total emissions, rather than the emissions from an individual household
> or company, and that its shadow-price is therefore equal for all. You could also see this as an

> for $110/tCO 2, then surely it would be mutually a-dvantageous to have the former company
> reduce harder and the latter company less hard.
> This arbitrage principle also works over time. If it costs $100/tCO 2 this year to reduce
> emissions and $100/tCO2 next year, then it would be cheaper not to reduce emissions by that
> much this year, put the money in the bank, and work harder next year. Arbitrage suggests that

> Comparing the above results, the following insights emerge. If we impose a constraint on

> analysis.
> 4. 7 Environmental effectiveness*
> Besides cost-effectiveness, environmental effectiveness is the other main criterion for environmental
> policy. A policy intervention is useless unless it reduces emissions by at least roughly
> the desired amount. Tradable emission permits, if monitored and enforced, guarantee environmental
> effectiveness, as there is a cap on total emissions. Taxes and subsidies have no such
> guarantee. Unless the regulator knows the marginal abatement cost curve of each emitter, the
> regulator cannot accurately predict how companies and households will respond to either a tax
> or a subsidy. The regulator therefore does not know by how much emissions will be reduced.
> Direct regulation covers many different policy interventions, some of which have relatively
> certain environmental results. An emission cap per installation is an example, although more
> installations may be built. Sometimes, emission caps only hold for installations above a threshold
> size, and companies may opt for more, smaller installations in response.
> If direct regulation targets inputs or technologies, behavioural change may partly defy the
> environmental goals. Improved energy efficiency, for instance, lowers the effective price of
> energy services and may lead to increased energy use rather than reduced emissions-the socalled
> rebound effect first discussed by W.S. Jevons in 1865. For instance, building insulation
> may lead to warmer homes rather than lower energy use.
> 4.8 Taxes versus tradable permits under uncertainty**
> With permit trade, emissions are known but costs are not. With taxes, marginal
> costs are known but emissions are not.
> We have seen above that tradable permits lead to a certain environmental outcome, but the
> permit price and hence the costs of abatement are unpredictable. Vice versa, the marginal cost
> of abatement is known for an emission tax and this puts an upper bound on the total costs
> of abatement. However, the effect on the environment is uncertain. The Weitzman Theorem
> provides guidance which is worse.
> Figure 4.2 shows a standard benefit-cost analysis. The marginal costs of abatement rise
> as emissions are cut further. The marginal benefits of abatement fall with emission reduction.
> The optimal tax is set where the marginal cost curve crosses the marginal benefit curve. The
> optimal emission target is set at the same point.
> Now suppose that the government believes that emission reduction is more expensive than
> it really is. If the government uses a quantity instrument, it underregulates: The emissions

> they are. However, if the government uses a price instrument, it overregulates: The emissions
> tax is higher than it should be because the regulator believes that the efficacy is lower than it
> is.

> EU ETS is now in its third phase. The first phase, 2005-2007, was primarily a test phase.
> The second phase, 2008-2012, helped Europe meet its commitments under the Kyoto
> Protocol. The current, third phase, 2013-2020, reflects the EU's unilateral commitments

> The EU ETS a large, international emission permit market. It suffered
> from avoidable teething problems.
> The EU ETS covers the emissions of 11,000 installations (not companies) in 31 countries.
> Some 45% of all greenhouse gas emissions fall under the EU ETS. Included are
> carbon dioxide from power and heat generation, metal production, pulp and paper, bulk
> chemicals, and mineral products; nitrous oxide from the production of acids; and perfluorocarbons
> from aluminium production. Carbon dioxide from intra-Union aviation is

> would be administratively costly as there are so many participants. Some people would
> find it difficult to manage their individual carbon account. The EU therefore opted for
> a mid-stream market.
> Emission permits are held in electronic registries. Permits can be traded over-thecounter
> (that is, directly between two emitters), on a number of exchanges, and via
> brokers. Derivatives markets quickly appeared. More recently, permits can be bought
> at auctions too.
> Emission permits are fungible within each phase. That is, emission permits for the third
> phase can be used at any time between 2013 and 2020. Between phase 2 and 3, emission
> permits can be banked but not borrowed. That is, a 2008-2012 emission permit is still
> valid after 2012. A 2013-2020 emission permit, on the other hand, was not valid before
> 2013 but will presumably be valid after 2020.
> Initially, permits were grandparented, that is, allocated for free to companies on the
> basis of past emissions. Over time, more and more permits are auctioned. In 2013, 40%
> of permits were auctioned. This should rise to 100% in 2020. These permit auctions are
> the second direct source of revenue for the European Commission.
> The EU ETS has had a number of teething problems, some of which could have been
> avoided. Initially, permits were allocated by the Member States. As the El" ETS covers
> only about half of the emissions, and constraints on the other half are not enforced, every
> Member State allocated more permits to its companies than it should have, in the hope
> of creating a new export industry. When the market collapsed under the oversupply,
> the European Commission took over the allocation of permits.
> In the beginning, VAT treatment of permits was different between Member States.

> with VAT. Instead of transferring the VAT to the rightful treasury, the company was
> folded and the monies laundered. Several people ended in jail. Many more are probably
> lazing in the sun. Since 2010, VAT treatment has been harmonized.
> There were administrative problems too. Several electronic registries were hacked, and

> monitoring went on maternity leave and was not replaced. Monitoring is essential for
> the integrity of the permits. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate

> were also suspended for irregularities in emissions monitoring. The EU ETS did not
> follow suit.
> Enforcement is the greatest challenge for the EU ETS, as it relies on

> Countries can also impose conversion rates. For instance, an imported permit may be set

> deemed equal to 900 kg of domestic CO2 . This conversion rate may reflect different definitions

> Box 4.6: Emissions trade in practice: The Clean Development Mechanism
> The Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
> (UNFCCC) legislated for "where flexibility", three mechanisms that allow a country
> to reduce its costs of emission reduction by investing in abatement in another country.
> These mechanisms are trade in emission permits between countries of the OECD, Activities
> Implemented Jointly between OECD countries and countries of the former Soviet
> block, and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) between OECD countries and
> the rest of the world. Only the last instrument has been put to substantial use.
> The Clean Development Mechanism appears to have led to neither
> development nor emission reduction.
> A key characteristic of the CDM originates from the fact that most OECD countries
> have emission targets but other countries do not. It is therefore not possible to trade
> emission permits. Emission permits are derived from an emission allocation, and total
> emissions can readily be compared with total emission permits. Instead, in the CDM,
> there is trade in Certified Emission Reduction credits (CERs). CERs are defined on a
> project basis. CERs are the difference between what emissions would have been without
> the project, and actual emissions (with the project).
> CERs are defined by a counterfactual. Therefore, CERs are bureaucratic constructs.
> The bureaucracy is quite elaborate, with many forms and many committees. This
> implies that the CDM is skewed towards larger projects (so as to justify the fixed cost
> of project approval) and towards middle-income countries (which have the necessary
> expertise to get the project approved). This also implies that the price of CERs has
> always been a few euros below the price of emission permits in the EU ETS, even though
> the two certificates are legally equivalent and fully fungible.
> Because CERs are counterfactual and project-based, it is difficult to guarantee that
> the certificates represent real emission reduction. That is of course one reason why
> the bureaucracy is so elaborate. But current safeguards are insufficient. For instance,
> planting forests would permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere-if the
> trees remain. However, legal tenure of the land-and hence the integrity of the forest
> as a store of carbon-means little in countries with capricious courts or rulers, or in
> countries where contracts are badly enforced. Contracts can be annulled or ignored,
> leaving the holders of CERs empty-handed.
> As another example, a project to close down a factory for motorcycles in Indonesia would
> qualify as emission reduction and be eligible for CERs-even if this project leaves the
> demand for motorcycles unchanged and hence emissions from motorcycle production.
> Such a project would be profitable if the revenue of the sale of CERs is greater than the
> cost of buying and winding down the business.
> As a third example, some industrial gases, that are very potent greenhouse gases, can be
> made cheaply. Projects that closed the factories of such gases used to qualify for CERs.
> This was discontinued when it became apparent that some factories were built with the
> sole purpose of closing them down and selling the resulting CERs-while selling on the
> manufacturing equipment to the next such scam.
> Despite these problems, almost 8,000 CDM projects had been approved in September
> 2017. There clearly is a demand for certificates that can be held in lieu of emission
> reduction at home.
> 4.12 Technological change**
> Technological progress in renewable energy, energy efficiency and agriculture
> drives the costs of climate policy.
> The cost of greenhouse gas emission reduction is driven by the price difference between
> fossil fuel and carbon-neutral energy. Abatement costs would fall if technological change can
> be directed towards alternative energy sources. Similarly, abatement costs would fall if the rate
> of energy efficiency improvement can be accelerated. Furthermore, there is a large variation
> in energy efficiencies between similar activities in different companies, sectors, and countries.
> Emissions would fall if energy technology would diffuse faster.
> Diverting R&D towards energy and agriculture would be expensive as these
> are small sectors in the economy.
> Technological change should be treated with care. It would be great if technological change
> could be accelerated at zero cost. However, there may be large opportunity costs if technological
> progress is redirected towards energy. On a cost basis, energy is a few percent of the total
> economy. Costs would be substantial if we accelerate technological progress for energy at the
> expen~e of decelerating technological progress for the rest of the economy. In the short term,
> there IS a fixed supply of smart and creative people. More people working on R&D in energy
> means fewer people working on R&D in ICT, rnedicine, and so on.
> In the long term, the number of smart and creative people can be boosted, primarily by
> improving nutrition, health care, and education. The academic world is dominated by white
> men, not because they are smarter, but rather because they are privileged. Changing this is
> beyond the scope of climate policy, however.
> Technological change is important. How can the government stimulate it? Technological
> progress comes in three stages: invention, innovation, and diffusion. Invention is a new idea or
> a new blueprint. Innovation takes an existing idea or blueprint and turns it into a product or
> service that can be sold, or a process that can be implemented. Diffusion takes the new product
> from its first sale to a substantial market penetration. All three stages are important, but they
> require a different set of skills and a different set of policy interventions (if any).
> Invention requires smart people being creative. It cannot be forced, but it can be stimulated.
> Invention is primarily done in universities, research institutes, and some corporate laboratories.
> Inventions rarely generate intellectual property rights. Inventions instead contribute to the
> global stock of knowledge. Inventors are motivated by glory and curiosity rather than by
> money. A country can best stimulate invention by rewarding its researchers for doing what
> they happen to be good at, and of course by supporting universities and research institutes.
> As argued in Chapter 2, decarbonization of the economy does not require new inventions.
> We know how to supply the world's energy demand many times over without emitting carbon
> dioxide. The problem is that carbon-neutral energy sources are unproven, impractical, or
> expensive. Innovation and diffusion are therefore more important than invention.
> Innovation is best done by corporate researchers. Innovation is not about creating something
> new, but rather about turning something that works in theory into something that works in
> practice, and sell it. There are a few successful government innovations, and many unsuccessful
> ones. Corporate innovation has a high failure rate too, of course, but not nearly as bad as the
> public sector. Innovators take risks and are motivated by the prospect of making it big. The
> role of the government is to incentivize large companies to put its smartest people on climatefriendly
> research and development; and start-ups to focus on alternative energy.
> Diffusion is best done by entrepreneurs. It is about getting ever more customers to buy the
> new product. Diffusion is about turning something that works into something that people want.
> Diffusers are motivated by the prospect of a steady and growing stream of profits. Government
> can help through regulation, but it is not a core task of the public sector to supply the market.
> The policy instruments to incentivize diffusion are discussed above: taxes and tradable permits.
> In sum, climate-specific technology policy should focus on innovation rather than invention
> or diffusion. The government has a number of instruments to stimulate innovation.
> R&D is best stimulated by patents, prizes, and taxes. Governments are bad
> at picking winners.
> Patents are probably the key instrument. Innovations can be copied by other companies.
> If the embedded knowledge cannot be kept a secret-for instance, because the product can be
> reverse-engineered-patents provide legal protection against copycats. Essentially, patents give
> a temporary monopoly on a particular technology. The patent holder either exclusively makes
> the product, or licenses other companies to do so. The monopoly rents reward the innovator for
> the effort made in innovation and the risks taken. If patents are properly designed, the efficiency
> loss due to monopolistic supply is smaller than the welfare gain from accelerated innovation.
> Patents are a generic instrument that serves all innovation, not just climate-friendly innovation.
> Other widely used instruments are R&D subsidies and tax breaks. There are two
> problems with this. First, it rewards effort rather than success-and perhaps not even that as
> creative accounting may be just as effective in reaping these subsidies. Second, R&D subsidies
> ~e often very specific. This is, politicians or civil servants decide which particular technology
> IS worthy of support. It may be that politicians and civil servants have excellent foresight into
> what products are likely to succeed in the market place,6 but more often than not government
> backs the wrong horse.
> Economists refer to this as "picking winners". Governments are bad at picking winners.
> Politicians know a lot about politics, and civil servants know a lot about the civil service; they
> are less well-versed in the private sector. Besides, the public sector does not bet its own money
> and thus lacks a key device to discipline risk taking.
> The government is a large consumer. It can use its buying power to back particular products

> sells such vaccines for $1 or less. This guarantees a market for a yet-to-be-invented product.
> This is not picking winners, because the government specifies the outcome rather than the
> technology. It rewards success rather than effort. The same model can be applied for climate
> policy.
> Instead of promising to buy particular goods, the government can also forbid its substitutes.
> The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (see Box 12.1), for instance,
> forbade CFCs, thus creating a market for HFCs. The chemical industry in the Netherlands

> creates an incentive to innovate: the ability to force out the competition. It lets innovators,
> rather than civil servants and politicians, set the pace of innovation. It rewards success not
> effort. And it does not pick winners.
> Guaranteed procurement or a greater market share can be regarded as a "prize" for winning
> the technological race. The government can also grant actual prizes. This was a popular
> policy in the 18th and 19th centuries. More recently, the X Atari prizes have been reasonably
> successful. The prize for space flight, for instance, was $10 million but generated research worth
> $300 million; and may have kick-started a new market.
> Innovation is best stimulated, however, by credible abatement policy. Innovation is an
> investment in the future. It is a bet that there will be a market for the product-to-be-created.
> In the case of greenhouse gas emission reduction, the demand is primarily driven by government
