> The vast majority of the vulnerability indicators seem irrelevant to each of the sectors. Said another way, using subsets of the indicators would have produced a more accurate or robust result, and as new indicators are added beyond this, the value of the analysis was reduced. Vulnerability is not, as section 2.2.3 suggestions, sector agnostic.

It will be also clearer for me, to distinguish what you would consider desirable or optimal (but perhaps cannot suggest to adopt a different approach at this point in time) and what specific corrective measures you think they could and should implement

> The Web Portal (Klimafolgen) tool is a notable extension beyond the core requirements of the grant, but it has significant problems. In some cases, it just does not show results. For example, for the Agriculture data for Europe, the map shows, but clicking on the map brings up an empty table for all crops. Under water for Europe, only annual values are available and all season columns are empty (not only for values like surface runoff, but even for just precipitation).
> 
> The bias-correction method may be inappropriate. Lange et al. 2018 was developed for solar radiation, and it is not clear how the trend-preserving quantile mapping was applied to temperature and precipitation. Also, consistency between temperature and precipitation is important for many biophysical results, but it appears that the downscaling method was applied to each variable independently.

> The proposal states that NCSRD will using RCMs to provide 20 km grid resolution for Europe and 5 km resolution “where necessary”. However, it is stated here that RCMs are only used for the Athens metropolitan area and calibrating the weather generator. Elsewhere, empirical downscaling is used.

**assistant**:
> Certainly! I'll provide suggested revisions based on the sample you provided, focusing on specific corrective actions.

> The Web Portal (Klimafolgen) tool is a notable extension beyond the core requirements of the grant, but it has significant problems. In some cases, it just does not show results. Please address the issue with displaying results in the portal. For example, the Agriculture data map for Europe should not bring up empty tables for all crops when clicked. Similarly, ensure that for the water section in Europe, seasonal columns are filled with the appropriate values, such as those for surface runoff and precipitation.

> The bias-correction method may be inappropriate. The method by Lange et al. 2018 was developed for solar radiation, and it is not clear how it has been applied to temperature and precipitation. Please provide clarification and ensure that the trend-preserving quantile mapping method is applicable to temperature and precipitation. Additionally, maintain consistency between temperature and precipitation, as their independent downscaling may affect biophysical results. Review and adjust the methodology to ensure consistency.

Please clarify what specific areas beyond Athens are necessary for the 5 km resolution and ensure the proposal's methodology reflects this.

Please provide validation data showing daily temporal and spatial patterns relative to observed records to support the model's outputs.

> This deliverable provides a clear overview of the state of knowledge, as represented both by the existing literature and the work of WP2.
> Agriculture impacts are area-weighted, which results in an aggregate yield change across a collection of crops. However, this is not a consistent way to describe sectoral productivity reduction, since not all crops have the same economic value (price) or start from the same yield so that yield-unit losses are equally significant.
> Flooding from D2.2 relies on the SWIM model, but it is not clear how or if these results inform the economic flooding valuation in D2.3. Only PESETA and COACCH results are discussed.
> The WBGT productivity losses appear to only be calculated for outdoor temperatures, but there is no discussion of which sectors or activities these apply to.
> There is no discussion of the Bayesian network structure described in the proposal.
> There does not appear to be a systematic review performed here. While various projects and literature are reviewed, there is no protocol for how they are identified and evaluated.

> Agriculture impacts are area-weighted, resulting in an aggregate yield change across a collection of crops. Please revisit this approach, as it is not a consistent way to describe sectoral productivity reduction. Consider incorporating the economic value (price) of each crop and the initial yield levels, since losses in yield units are not equally significant across different crops.

> Flooding from D2.2 relies on the SWIM model; however, it is unclear how or if these results inform the economic flooding valuation in D2.3. Please clarify the connection between the results from the SWIM model and the economic valuation discussed in D2.3. Ensure that discussions on PESETA and COACCH results are contextualized within that framework.

> The WBGT productivity losses appear to only be calculated for outdoor temperatures. Please provide a discussion that clarifies which sectors or activities these productivity losses apply to, as this information is currently lacking.

**user**:
> Thank you. Here is one last deliverable assessment:
> ===
> The socioeconomic and downscaling approaches used here are largely sophisticated and appropriate, producing plausible results.
> Regional attractiveness indexes are not intended for downscaling.
> The observed disaggregations often have both positive and negative impacts in the same country, derived from a downscaling of a single (positive or negative) impact. It is not clear how this could result from an index, which generally should just provide weights.
> As before, labour productivity assumed WBGT applies in air-conditioned settings. Notably, this is orthogonal to the intensity level of the work.
> Outcomes in the agriculture sector will depend upon the extent of climate impacts in other countries. If other countries are worse hit, outcomes will be better for the EU. It is not clear what assumptions are made.

**assistant**:

> The socioeconomic and downscaling approaches used here are largely sophisticated and appropriate, producing plausible results.

> However, regional attractiveness indexes are not intended for downscaling. Please clarify the purpose of these indexes in your analysis, as their connection to downscaling may not be appropriate.
> 
> The observed disaggregations often reveal both positive and negative impacts within the same country, arising from the downscaling of a single (positive or negative) impact. Please provide a clear explanation of how this occurs, since an index typically should only provide weights and not contradictory results.

> Regarding labor productivity, it is assumed that the WBGT applies in air-conditioned settings. Please clarify this assumption, as it does not account for the intensity level of work, which could be an important factor in productivity analysis. 
> 
> Outcomes in the agriculture sector will depend on the extent of climate impacts in other countries. If other countries are more severely affected, outcomes may improve for the EU. Please specify the assumptions made regarding this interplay between countries to bring clarity to your analysis.
