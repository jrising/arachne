> Kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a unit of energy, not power. It represents the amount of energy consumed or produced over a period of one hour when operating at a constant power of one kilowatt. In other words, 1 kWh is the energy equivalent to using 1,000 watts for one hour.

**assistant**:
> Yes, kilowatt (kW) is a unit of power. It measures the rate at which energy is used or produced. One kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts. Power indicates how quickly energy is transferred or converted, while energy itself (measured in kilowatt-hours, for example) refers to the total amount consumed or generated over time.
