> Now, in the form, I would like for you to write the text for several landing pages where we've identified a suggested program for them, based on their responses. First, can you suggest text to briefly mention points about the Masters in Marine Policy? Here's the description from the catalog:
> 
> The Masterâ€™s Degree in Marine Policy (M.M.P.) prepares students for careers in research, management, and administration in marine-oriented government agencies, private associations and business firms. The M.M.P. provides graduate students with post-baccalaureate training in policy analysis and coastal and ocean management to be competitive for positions in the public and private sectors and for matriculating into Ph.D. programs.
**assistant**:
> Here's a draft of the landing page text for the Master's in Marine Policy, which has now transitioned to the Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track:
> 
> ---
> 
> **Masters in Marine Policy (Transitioned to Environmental Science & Management)**
> 
> The Master's Degree in Marine Policy, now part of the innovative Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program, equips students for impactful careers in marine-oriented government agencies, private associations, and business firms. With a strong focus on policy analysis and coastal and ocean management, this program prepares graduates to excel in positions across the public and private sectors. The ESM program incorporates an enriching Marine track, providing students with the necessary post-baccalaureate training to thrive in professional roles or continue their academic journey into Ph.D. programs.
> 
> By pursuing the Environmental Science & Management program, you will engage in a rigorous curriculum that blends policy analysis with practical management approaches. Whether you're aiming to influence marine policy or lead initiatives in environmental stewardship, this track offers a dynamic platform to cultivate your skills and achieve your career goals.
>

**user**:
> Now, for students who have been identified to fit into the EE program. Here's the full catalog description, but I am looking for something shorter.
> 
> The Environmental Economics programs train students in state-of-the-art economics and policy analysis pertaining to environmental issues, combining an emphasis on quantitative approaches with unique strengths in interdisciplinary and marine applications such as fisheries, offshore energy, coastal land use, sea level rise, and climate change. Students study how to manage environmental resources, evaluate the effectiveness of policies, ensure sustainability and environmental justice, and address local and global environmental change.
> 
> This is a multidisciplinary program, equipping students with the tools and knowledge to understand complex issues from multiple perspectives. Economics provides a common language for understanding the decision-making process in light of financial, policy, and environmental drivers. Students also take classes from the natural sciences and learn how to integrate knowledge across disciplines to address questions of policy. The program is housed in the School of Marine Science & Policy, drawing upon its long tradition of interaction between the natural and social sciences, along with its world-class environmental researchers and facilities. In addition, students have access to courses and faculty expertise at the Biden School of Public Policy & Administration, the College of Agriculture & Natural Resources, and the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics.
> 
> Students build expertise in policy areas of their choosing and acquire cutting-edge research and analytical skills. The EE programs are appropriate for students with quantitative social science backgrounds seeking to better understand environmental issues; STEM students who want to apply their interests to public policy; persons with experience in public or private sectors looking to advance their environmental policy expertise; and recently graduated students continuing their matriculation with focused interests related to environmental economics. Students from diverse backgrounds and international students are encouraged to apply.
