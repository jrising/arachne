**user**:
> In Excel, how can I convert a degree-minute coordinate representation like "-75 15.907" to a decimal coordinate?
**assistant**:
> In Excel, you can convert degree-minute coordinates into decimal coordinates using a simple formula. Here are the steps to follow:
> 
> 1. **Split Coordinate Components:** If the degree and minute components are together in one cell (like "-75 15.907"), you will first need to split them into two cells. You can use the `Data > Text to Columns` feature in Excel. In the `Text to Columns` wizard, select `Delimited`, click `Next`, choose `Space` as your delimiter, and then click `Finish`.
> 
> 2. **Convert to Decimal:** After you've split your coordinates, you should have the degree in one cell and the minutes in another. For example, assume "-75" is in cell A2 and "15.907" is in B2. You can then convert to decimal degrees with the following formula:
> 
>     ```
>     =IF(A2<0, A2 - B2/60, A2 + B2/60)
>     ```
> 
> This formula is checking if the degree is negative (which would be the case for coordinates in the southern hemisphere for latitude and the western hemisphere for longitude). If it's negative, it subtracts the minutes converted to degrees (minutes/60), if positive, it adds. 
> 
> This will give you the location in decimal degrees. 
> 
> Remember, this process assumes your starting data are in degrees and decimal minutes, which is typically how GPS devices give coordinates. If your minutes field also includes seconds (like "15.907" is actually "15 minutes 54.42 seconds"), you'd need a different conversion.
