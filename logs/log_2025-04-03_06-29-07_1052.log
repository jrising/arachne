> **Phase Two: Assessing Economic Risks**
> 
> Summary of phase two: This phase highlights some of the potential economic risks stemming from the degradation of the Colorado Basin. The assessment indicates that local economic effects for businesses are particularly felt in the agriculture, energy, and tourism sectors. These economic effects could cascade through value chains and transmit to other sectors via increased food, water, and energy prices. The assessment also identifies potential macro-economic risks, including reductions in agricultural productivity, increased commodity prices, and increased fiscal spending on mitigating and transition measures. Potential direct effects on households and communities add to these risks. The loss of drinking water and recreational opportunities could reduce productivity, affect the health of local populations, and trigger conflicts over water rights. The use of technology and changes in production processes facilitate substitution and reduce vulnerability to the degradation of the Colorado Basin. However, substitution possibilities for freshwater are limited and may not be implemented rapidly enough to offset short-term water shortages.
> 
> **Droughts in the Colorado Basin:** Droughts in this region have triggered direct, mostly local, economic effects that particularly impact food production. The region’s reliance on the Colorado Basin for agriculture, irrigation, and general employment exacerbates the threat to food production and labor income as overuse and diminishing water resources significantly strain the agricultural sector. The Colorado Basin supports an estimated 8 billion US dollars in direct annual income from agriculture. Specifically, it supports 90 percent of the region’s winter vegetables, sustains cattle and dairy operations throughout the western United States, and supports around 175,000 acres of cotton cultivation in Arizona.
> 
> **Decreased water flow and hydropower:** Decreased water flow also hampers the generation of hydropower, affecting energy production for households and industries. For instance, in 2021, hydropower facilities at the Nevada-Arizona border have more than 4,200 megawatts of electricity-generating capacity. Approximately half of this capacity is located at the Hoover Dam, generating electricity for roughly 1.3 million residents. Short-term projections show that an annual 0.5% to 2.5% drop in hydropower generation from the Hoover Dam can be expected because of a decrease in water flow. As the demand for electricity continues to grow...
