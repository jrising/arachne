**assistant**:
> In Julia, you can create a sequence of values that start from `A` and end at `B`, with a length of `N` using the `range()` function.

> The syntax for the `range()` function is as follows:

> ```
> range(start, stop; length=N, ...)

> where `start` is the starting value, `stop` is the ending value, and `N` is the length of the sequence. You can also specify other optional arguments like `step`, `stop`, and `inclusive` to customize the sequence.

> Here's an example of how you can use the `range()` function to create a sequence of 10 values that start from 1 and end at 5:
> 
> ```julia
> julia> range(1, 5; length=10)
> 1.0:0.4444444444444444:5.0

> In this example, the `length` argument is set to `10` to specify that we want a sequence of 10 values. The `range()` function returns a range object, which is a lazy sequence of values that you can iterate over or convert to an array if needed.
