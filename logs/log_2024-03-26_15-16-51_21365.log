> I have a list of dictionarys. How can I make that a pandas dataframe?
**assistant**:
> To convert a list of dictionaries into a Pandas DataFrame, you can pass it directly into the DataFrame constructor like so:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # Assume you have a list of dictionaries like this:
> 
> my_list = [
>     {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'occupation': 'Scientist'},
>     {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30, 'occupation': 'Engineer'},
>     {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35, 'occupation': 'Doctor'},
> ]
> 
> # Convert to DataFrame:
> df = pd.DataFrame(my_list)
> 
> # Now, df is a DataFrame with rows formed from the dictionaries in your list.
> ```
> 
> This will create a table where each dictionary is a row and the keys of the dictionaries form the column headers. If every dictionary does not contain the same keys, pandas will put `NaN` for missing data.
> 
> Remember that the order of columns in the resulting DataFrame will not necessarily preserve the order of dictionary keys.
