> Can I use R's raster's disaggregate on the time dimension of a RasterStack, so that each time's value within each grid cell is duplicated multiple times?
**assistant**:
> The `disaggregate` function in R's `raster` package is primarily designed for spatial disaggregation, not for temporal disaggregation in a `RasterStack` or `RasterBrick`. However, you can achieve your goal of duplicating each time's value within each grid cell multiple times by manually creating a new `RasterStack` or `RasterBrick` with the desired number of layers and copying the values from the original one.
