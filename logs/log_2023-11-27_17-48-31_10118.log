> 
> Dear Hiring Manager,
> 
> I am thrilled to submit my application for the position at Vote Mama. As a sustainability professional with over a decade of experience leading projects for mission-driven organizations, my career reflects a committed focus to bring about meaningful change in the areas relating to environmental and social well-being. This commitment aligns deeply with Vote Mama's mission — to empower mothers to drive progressive, family-friendly legislation.
> 
> In my various professional roles, ranging from working in organisations promoting clean energy transition to mitigating climate impacts on health, I have consistently aimed to support and articulate the voices of those often underrepresented in the decision-making processes. I understand the enormous potential for change when we leverage the unique experiences and perspectives of women, particularly mothers, in our political landscape. 
> 
> As the Manager of Strategic Partnerships at Clean Energy Buyers Association, I successfully expanded a network of clean energy buyers, service and energy providers from 200 to over 400 corporate participants, representing $7.5 trillion in annual revenue. I led international stakeholders in deploying strategies to decarbonise the grid, facilitated deals that brought over 64 GW of clean energy to the grid, and worked closely with corporate leaders to maximize their environmental and social outcomes through the procurement of clean energy. I believe this experience can significantly contribute to promoting Vote Mama's objectives at the local, state, and national level.
> 
> During my time with the Climate Group, I built and maintained multinational relationships, grew corporate clean energy programs, and raised half a million dollars in new funds. My ability to liaise effectively with diverse stakeholders, across nonprofits, businesses, and governments, to deliver outstanding outcomes will be of great value to Vote Mama’s efforts in electing moms and ensuring the passage of truly family-friendly legislation.
> 
> Additionally, as someone who has worked closely with academic institutions and developed educational materials, I recognize the importance of informed advocacy work to drive systemic change. I am confident that my skills and experiences align with Vote Mama's mission and I am excited for the opportunity to contribute to its efforts to promote mothers in the political landscape.
> 
> Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Vote Mama and championing the political power of mothers across the country.
> 
> Kind Regards,

> 
> **How would you explain planetary health to your colleagues? Why should they care about planetary health?**
> 
> Planetary health refers to the interconnection between the health of our planet and the well-being of humans and all living beings. It recognizes that human health, social well-being, and environmental sustainability are interconnected and dependent on the health of the natural systems that support us.
> 
> I would explain to my colleagues that planetary health encompasses a wide range of issues, including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and ecosystem degradation. It highlights the ways in which these environmental challenges directly impact our health, livelihoods, and societies.
> 
> Colleagues should care about planetary health because it directly affects their own well-being and that of future generations. Environmental degradation and climate change pose significant threats to our access to clean air, water, and food, as well as to stable economies and social systems. By prioritizing planetary health, we can create a sustainable and resilient future for ourselves and future generations.
> 
> Moreover, embracing planetary health presents opportunities for innovation, job creation, and economic growth. It allows us to develop sustainable solutions that simultaneously address environmental challenges and improve human well-being. By caring about planetary health, we can foster a healthier, fairer, and more prosperous world for all.
> 
> **Things move quickly in a small, dynamic team. Tell us about a time when you supported something that wasn’t in your job description. Why was it necessary? What was the outcome?**
> 
> In a previous role at an environmental NGO, I found myself in a situation where our communications team was overwhelmed with tasks due to a sudden surge in media attention. Recognizing the urgency of the situation and the importance of managing the external perception of the organization effectively, I stepped in to support the team, even though it wasn't officially part of my job description.
> 
> I worked closely with my colleagues, assisting with drafting press releases, coordinating media interviews, and monitoring social media channels. By taking on these additional responsibilities, we were able to ensure timely and accurate communication with the public and stakeholders, maintaining a positive image for the organization during a critical time.
> 
> The outcome was a successful handling of the media surge, with positive coverage and increased awareness of our organization's work. Additionally, this experience strengthened the collaboration and trust among team members, as we were able to effectively navigate a challenging situation together.
> 
> **Please share an example of a high-impact engagement campaign or program you have led.**
> 
> One example of a high-impact engagement campaign I led was a sustainability awareness initiative in collaboration with a major university. The goal of the campaign was to inspire behavior change among students, faculty, and staff to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainable practices on campus.
> 
> To achieve this, I designed and executed a multi-faceted campaign that included educational workshops, interactive events, and targeted communication strategies. We leveraged social media platforms, created engaging infographics and videos, and organized campus-wide competitions to foster enthusiasm and participation.
> 
> The outcome was an overwhelming response from the university community. Energy consumption was reduced by 15% during the campaign period, resulting in significant cost savings for the university. Moreover, the campaign sparked a sense of environmental stewardship among students, leading to the establishment of sustainable student clubs and initiatives even after the campaign ended.
> 
> This engagement campaign not only achieved measurable results in terms of energy savings but also created a lasting culture of sustainability on campus. It demonstrated the power of effective communication, community involvement, and the potential for individuals to make a real difference when inspired to take action.
