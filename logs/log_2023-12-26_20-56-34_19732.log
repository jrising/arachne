**user**:
> What is an appropriate number of samples for computing an Anderson-Darling comparing two distributions? I have 6 million samples (about 3 million for each of two distributions), but that seems too much for the algorithm. 10000 samples takes about 4 seconds to compute, which is still a while.
**assistant**:
> The Anderson-Darling test performs a comparison of a given sample of data against a specified distribution. However, despite its powerful statistical properties, it can suffer from high computational demands when tested with very large datasets.
> 
> When using large datasets, a common approach is to randomly sample a subset of the data and then perform the test on the subset. While a larger number of samples generally leads to a more accurate result (due to the law of large numbers), there is often a point of diminishing returns beyond which adding more samples has negligible benefit.
> 
> The appropriate number of samples can be influenced by several factors, including:
> 
> 1. The level of accuracy you need: If you're looking for very precise results, you might need to use more samples. However, if you're only looking for a rough estimate, fewer samples might suffice.
> 
> 2. Computational capacity: If your system can handle large numbers of samples without significant slowdown, you might be able to use more. However, if processing time is a concern, you might need to limit the number of samples.
> 
> 3. The complexity of the distribution: More 'uniform' distributions may need fewer samples to accurately represent them, while more complex or 'jagged' distributions may need more.
> 
> Given these considerations, a common choice in practice is to use somewhere in the range of 1000 to 10,000 samples. As you've noted, 10,000 samples take roughly 4 seconds - this may seem long, but keep in mind that statistical tests like this are often run only once or infrequently, so it may be tolerable.
> 
> However, to be more certain about the optimal number of samples for your specific situation, you could perform a sensitivity analysis. Start by using a smaller number of samples (for example, 500), then incrementally increase the number of samples and note how much the test statistic (and your other results of interest) change. If they stabilize after a certain number of samples, you can use that number as a guideline for the minimum number of samples that give a stable and sufficiently accurate result.

> I've been confused about the "k" and the "X-sample" in the Anderson-Darling test. Does it refer to the number of distributions or the number of samples per distribution?
**assistant**:
> In the context of the Anderson-Darling test, the "k" denotes the number of distributions being compared, while the "X-sample" refers to the number of samples per distribution.
> 
> To clarify further:
> 
> 1. "k" (number of distributions): The Anderson-Darling test is used to compare multiple distributions and determine if they significantly differ from each other. The value of "k" represents the number of distributions being considered simultaneously. In your case, if you are comparing two distributions, "k" would be 2.
> 
> 2. "X-sample" (number of samples per distribution): For each distribution being compared (each "k"), you would typically have a sample of data. The "X-sample" refers to the number of samples within each distribution. So, if you have 3 million samples for each of the two distributions, your "X-sample" would be 3 million for each distribution.
> 
> To summarize, "k" represents the number of distributions being compared, while the "X-sample" represents the number of samples within each distribution.
**user**:
> kSamples computes two versions of the test. The docs for ad.test say "Both versions of the AD statistic are computed." Which should I use?
**assistant**:
> When using the `ad.test` function, both versions of the Anderson-Darling (AD) statistic are computed by default. This is because the AD test has two different versions depending on the weights assigned to the different parts of the distribution.
> 
> The two versions are as follows:
> 
> 1. The "AD-statistic" version: This version treats all regions of the distribution equally, giving equal weights to all data points. This version is commonly used and assumes that all parts of the distribution have equal importance. It is the default option in the `ad.test` function.
> 
> 2. The "AD-STAR-statistic" version: This version assigns weights to different regions of the distribution based on their expected contribution to the test statistic. It downweights the regions near the center of the distribution and assigns higher weights to the tails where deviations are of greater interest. The AD-STAR statistic is considered more powerful in detecting deviations in the tails of the distribution.
> 
> In most cases, using both versions of the AD statistic is recommended because it provides a more comprehensive analysis. It can help you understand the overall deviation of the data from the reference distribution (AD-statistic version) while also focusing on potential deviations in the tails (AD-STAR-statistic version).
> 
> By default, `ad.test` computes both versions of the AD statistic and provides the results for both. You can then examine both statistics to gain insight into the characteristics of the data and make informed conclusions based on the test results.
