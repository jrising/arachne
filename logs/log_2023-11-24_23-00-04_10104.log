> How did COP27 further the discussion of Loss & Damage and set up the discussion on that topic for COP28?
**assistant**:
> At COP27, the issue of "Loss and Damage" – the financial support provided by developed countries to developing countries experiencing the most adverse effects of climate change – was given more time and attention than ever before. Yet, the specifics of support continue to be a point of contention because there has been a lack of commitment to provide compensation to countries experiencing loss and damage from historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions.
> 
> Key discussion points at COP27 included:
> 
> 1. **Highlighting the Need for Financial Support:** Many islands and less economically developed countries (LEDCs) stressed the dire need for financial assistance to cope with the impacts of climate change, including from severe weather and rising sea levels.
> 
> 2. **Defining "Loss and Damage" and sources of Funding:** Parties debated whether funding for "Loss and Damage" should be separate from funding for mitigation and adaptation. There were also discussions about potential sources of funding, such as levies on international shipping and airfare, taxes on international financial transactions, carbon pricing, and diverted fossil fuel subsidies.
> 
> 3. **Establishing a new Financing Framework:** Strides were made in establishing the "Santiago Network on Loss and Damage," intended to channel and enhance support to developing nation parties, particularly those most vulnerable to climate change.
> 
> Despite these discussions, COP27 did not result in formal, written commitments to provide new and additional funding to address loss and damage. This lack of concrete action led to significant disappointment among many smaller island nations and other developing nations.
> 
> Heading into COP28, the hope is for these conversations to solidify into binding legal and financial commitments that ensure vulnerable countries are adequately compensated for the losses and damages sustained from unforeseen, and often unpreventable, climate change impacts. The challenge will be resolving these contentious issues and galvanizing the needed political will among developed nations to establish more robust support mechanisms and funding sources.
