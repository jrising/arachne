> Economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK, and benefits of adaptation action
> 
> Organizational Background:
> 
> The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics is a world-recognised leader in climate policy. GRI is a multidisciplinary centre, bringing together expertise on economics, finance, geography, the environment, science, law, international relations, development and political science.

> 
> High-Level Framing and Problem Statement:
> 
> Climate change poses significant economic and fiscal risks to the United Kingdom, threatening both short-term stability and long-term prosperity. At the same time, future impacts depend crucially on policies across the UK for proactive adaptation, resilience in communities and in the financial system, and accurate targeting of funds. This proposal aims to address the urgent need for comprehensive, UK-specific climate damage scenarios that inform fiscal policy and adaptation strategies.
> 
> The Problem: Currently available models of climate risks are not yet fit-for-purpose to inform adaptation policy in the UK. For example, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios are not tailored to address the specific challenges the UK faces, nor do they fully capture complex risk channels, including international spillovers, which are crucial for fiscal policy planning.
> 
> Furthermore, existing assessments, like those in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) Fiscal Risks and Sustainability report of 2024, have acknowledged the looming gaps in data regarding adaptation costs and benefits. Although these efforts provide a starting point, they fall short in delivering a comprehensive understanding of the UK’s economic and fiscal vulnerabilities and the advantages offered by adaptation measures.
> 
> Finally, where available models do capture process-based details and adaptation, they are often opaque and challenging to use. Risk representations need to be more transparent and accessible.
> 
> Urgency and Necessity: 
> 
> As climate risks continue to rapidly evolve, HMT needs a better understanding of these risks, their fiscal implications, and the opportunities to address and manage them. Quantified risk information is needed for HMT actions and engagement with Ministers.
> 
> Given the limitations of existing models and studies, there is a need to:
> 
> Integrate sector-specific impacts into a cohesive macroeconomic framework.
> Advance evidence-based fiscal policy decisions, understanding how climate damage and the costs of adaptation could translate to public expenditure.
> Enhance knowledge on adaptation benefits and costs, supporting strategic decision-making regarding resource allocation.
> 
> This proposal builds on ongoing efforts and collaborations, including the Green Finance Institutes work on nature-related risks; the GRI study on UK risks; the Horizon-funded ACCREU project, and initiatives under UKRI and CCRA4. By developing open-source tools and sharing insights, the project aims to set a precedent for similar work worldwide, fostering a global understanding of adaptation benefits and climate risks.
> 
> The proposed approach seeks not only to illuminate the macroeconomic and fiscal impacts of climate change within the UK but also to facilitate the sensible distribution of funds across adaptation strategies to meet national risk reduction objectives. Through strategic modeling and analysis, this work endeavors to anchor HMT’s policy decisions in robust, empirical evidence, ensuring resilience and sustainability in the face of climate adversity.
> 
> Objective:
> 
> The overarching objective of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the economic and fiscal risks posed by climate damages to the UK, while also evaluating the benefits of adaptation actions. This framework will provide high-resolution insights into macroeconomic impacts, enabling informed decision-making and effective management of climate-related economic and fiscal risks.
> 
> Specifically, the proposal aims to:
> 
> Quantify UK Macroeconomic Impacts: Develop climate damage scenarios that integrate sector-specific models into a macroeconomic framework, such as NiGEM. This will include accounting for international spillovers and autonomous adaptation costs, providing a comprehensive view of the macroeconomic impacts of climate change under various warming scenarios.
> 
> Assess Fiscal Impacts and Adaptation Costs: Update and expand upon the OBR’s 2024 Fiscal Risks and Sustainability report by assessing the fiscal implications of climate damages and adaptation costs. This will ensure that fiscal policy is grounded in robust evidence and considers all relevant transmission channels.
> 
> Evaluate Adaptation Options: Analyse the fiscal and socioeconomic costs and benefits of key adaptation strategies. This evaluation will guide funding allocation towards effective adaptation measures, enhancing the UK’s resilience to climate impacts.
> 
> Enhance Decision-Making Tools: Develop and deliver transparent, open-source tools that facilitate ongoing analysis and integration of new evidence (e.g., CCRA4 outputs). This will empower stakeholders like HMT, OBR, and other policymakers to dynamically update and utilize the models for strategic planning and policy formulation.
> 
> Promote International Collaboration: By creating a replicable and open framework, this project aims to support other countries in conducting similar assessments, fostering international collaboration and the sharing of best practices in managing climate risks.
> 
> This proposal addresses key gaps identified in previous efforts, leveraging high-resolution data and cutting-edge modeling to produce actionable insights into the economic and fiscal dimensions of climate change. It aims to support the UK Government and related bodies in shaping resilient economic policies and informed adaptation strategies, ultimately contributing to global sustainability and risk management efforts.
> 
> Theory of change and Strategy
> 
> The theory of change for this proposal is predicated on the belief that informed decision-making rests on accurate, high-quality data about the economic and fiscal risks associated with climate change. By aggregating insights from existing UK sector models and integrating them into a robust macroeconomic framework, we can create a holistic understanding of the impacts of climate damage and the benefits of adaptation strategies.
> 
> The key tenets of this theory are:
> 
> Interconnected Data and Models: By synthesizing data from various sectoral models and collaborating with experts in academia and government, we will enhance the granularity and resolution of our climate damage scenarios. This will lead to a more nuanced understanding of how climate-related risks impact the UK economy.
> 
> Evidence-Based Assessment of Fiscal Risks: By providing rigorous assessments of fiscal implications linked to climate damages and adaptation costs, we can reshape how policymakers view and address climate risk. This evidence is critical for integrating climate considerations into fiscal planning and resource allocation.
> 
> Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration: Establishing a multi-disciplinary steering group composed of key stakeholders, including HMT, OBR, and academic experts, will facilitate knowledge sharing and create a sense of shared ownership over the findings. This collaborative approach ensures that outputs are relevant, actionable, and widely accepted.
> 
> Iterative Learning and Adaptation: The integration of new data and insights will allow for continuous improvements in our models and strategies, ensuring they remain adaptable to an evolving climate landscape.
> 
> Strategy: To operationalize this theory of change, our strategy will consist of the following key components:
> 
> Collaboration with Experts: Form a collaborative network of researchers, policymakers, and practitioners focused on climate economics. This network will facilitate best practice sharing, engagement with ongoing projects like Project Delta, and deepen our understanding of adaptation investment needs.
> 
> Transparent Outputs: Ensure that all modeling processes, assumptions, and data sources are transparent and well-documented. Outputs will be disseminated in user-friendly spreadsheet formats, enabling stakeholders to easily access and utilize the information.
> 
> Engagement and Education: Conduct outreach with government bodies and industry stakeholders to communicate findings and foster understanding of the economic and fiscal risks associated with climate impacts. This will enhance policy relevancy and encourage adoption of the insights generated.
> 
> Feedback Loops: Establish a mechanism for incorporating feedback from stakeholders and integrating new data generated from future research (e.g., the 2026 CCRA4 outputs) to refine our models and strategies continually.
> 
> By executing this strategy, we believe we can effectively address the identified problems, provide essential insights into the economic and fiscal risks stemming from climate change, and ultimately guide the UK towards more resilient policy outcomes that integrate adaptation efforts.
> 
> Work Programmes
> 
> 
> 
> 
> WP1: Scenario development
> WP1 consists of two related sets of scenarios: Climate and socioeconomic scenarios, used to project impacts, and risk case study scenarios, used as potential financial stress tests.
> 
> Task 1.1: Develop projection scenarios: Global warming levels are key markers to understand risks, but are not sufficient to project climate risks. Future climate impacts depend upon future socioeconomics, including income levels and inequality, population density, and past adaptation decisions, as well as the rate of warming and the pattern of warming domestically and internationally. This task lays out a set of scenarios, backed by broad narratives, and conforming to 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C global warming levels, and an AMOC scenario. These will roughly follow SSP3-7.0 in years 2040, 2060, and 2080.
> Future work will distinguish scenarios under high and low growth or international convergence, and represent other features of tail climatic risk, including the Labrador-Irminger Seas Convection tipping point and rapid sea-level rise.
> 
> Task 1.2: Case study scenario identification: In this project, case studies that describe potential macroeconomic and financial stress will be derived from a thorough exploration of the space of bottom-up (WP2) and top-down (WP3) risks. We will identify compound events in the projections, across the range of uncertainty and variability. Case studies will combine chronic shifts in climate with unexpected shocks to particular sectors, and explore how these propagate through the economic system, mirroring the approach in Ranger et al. (2024)1. These will be co-designed in consultation with HMT. Potential case studies will consider (1) agricultural failures leading to price spikes and inflation; (2) a heat wave driving spiraling hospital costs; and (3) a flooding event which results in infrastructure disruption. This task will translate quantitative information into narratives, while Task 4.1 will translate narratives back into quantitative scenarios.
> 
> 
> 
> Future work will explicitly represent cascading impacts through quantitative modeling and engage a larger body of stakeholders in the co-design process.
> 
> WP2: Expanding bottom-up financial risks
> 
> WP2 will improve upon the process developed for Rising et al. (2022)2, where results from detailed models are (a) translated into emulators using each model’s underlying climate assumptions, (b) producing damage functions for UK regions according to the underlying models, and then (c) downscaled to high-resolution administrative units across the UK. The key innovation will consist of incorporating adaptation benefits and costs, drawn from multiple sources.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Task 2.1: Collect channel-specific model results. Draw upon new literature and collaboration with experts across the UK to develop a robust set of detailed model results. Drawing upon the work of the ACCREU project and the Climate Impact Lab, we will also collect results on the costs and benefits of (1) autonomous adaptation and income-driven reductions in vulnerability and (2) policy-driven adaptation investment.

> Task 2.2: Calibrate regional damage functions: Using the approach in Rising et al. (2022), we will fit emulators to the results from Task 2.1. In addition, the relationships between adaptation costs and reductions in vulnerability will be represented as elasticities, allowing us to project damages under any level of social adaptation costs.
> Future work will separately model different types of investments, rather than considering a single aggregate adaptation cost relationship, and account for interdependencies that adaptation approaches have across multiple risks.
> 
> Task 2.3: Projection of domestic damages and financial risks: Domestic damages will be projected under the scenarios from Task 1.1 at high resolution across the UK. These will be related to financial risks, in collaboration with OBR. The focus of the financial risks will be on risks to financial stability and the tax base for the UK government.
> Future work will expand the understanding of financial risks to include insurance and business-side risk.
> 
> WP3: Incorporating adaptation into top-down risks
> Econometric studies have greatly increased our understanding of the impact temperatures and other weather variables have on GDP growth. NGFS currently uses one of these results, from Kotz et al. (2024), to describe financial risks. However, the NGFS approach misses important evidence. (a) The number of studies have explored this relationship is rapidly increasing with very different assumptions, and we will use a meta-analysis approach, developed by Rising & Tahmid (WP), to develop a best-estimate of top-down risks. (b) A number of studies show that impacts to GDP growth are persistent beyond the lower-bound used in Kotz et al., and we will model the uncertainty around these explicitly. (c) Estimates in this literature do not include risks related to sea-level rise, which we will add on. (d) These estimates structurally exclude effects from international interactions, which we will incorporate using a trade model (possibly also NiGEM).
> 
> Task 3.1: Model macro-econometric growth losses: While Rising & Tahmid (WP)5 study the effects of macroeconomic losses from 9 models in this historical period, we will project these damages into the future using the scenarios from Task 1.1, across all countries.
> Future work will incorporate information from expert elicitation of damages, from Howard & Sterner (2017) and Moore et al. (2024), and globally-correlated losses from Bilal & Känzig (2024).
> 
> Task 3.2: Meta-analysis of macro-econometric results: The meta-analysis will synthesize information from the models studied in Task 3.1 to produce a best-estimate of future GDP losses. This approach uses machine learning as developed in Rising & Tahmid (WP)5, and translates draws upon the different results from different study approaches to construct losses that are robustly likely to be estimated from a gold-standard approach.
> Future work would incorporate “error term” information to explore the variability around impacts, rather than just the expected loss level.
> 
> Task 3.3: Projection of foreign damages: Using the best estimate from Task 3.2, we will project damages into the future accounting for uncertainty. These will then be input into the NiGEM model to understand how trade will result in risk spillovers for the UK.
> Future work will use a empirically-estimated dynamic vulnerability approach, developed for the PAGE integrated assessment model, to incorporate adaptation into GDP growth effects.
> 
> WP4: Macroeconomic framework integration
> WP4 will combine information from WP2 and WP3 and translate it into inputs appropriate for the NiGEM model, following the approach used in Ranger et al. (2024)1. This is conceived as an iteration with WP1 and a collaboration with NIESR.
> 
> Task 4.1: Elaborate case study scenarios: After case studies have been identified and described across the space of potential risks in Task 1.2, this task will translate those risks into quantitative impacts for the NiGEM macroeconomic model. This will again use the results from WP2 and WP3 (as in Task 1.2), but draw specifically from results that correspond to the narratives.
> Future work will perform an iterative modeling process, incorporating cascading risk information, whereby the narratives and quantitative representations are developed through repeated stakeholder engagement.
> 
> Task 4.2: Analyse NiGEM results: The results from NiGEM will further inform the narrative process in WP1, and highlight avenues for improvement. The key outcome of the NiGEM integration under this task is a clearer understanding of financial and macroeconomic risks resulting from the narratives.
> Future work will expand the range of scenarios input into the NiGEM model to improve the tool development process in Task 5.1.
> 
> WP5: Adaptation policy development
> WP5 will translate results from WPs 2, 3, and 4 into an easy-to-use, flexible tool for HMT. The main goals of this tool are (1) the ability to quickly explore new scenarios of domestic and trade-related risks; (2) the ability to propose and analyse adaptation investment plans; and (3) the production of outputs that can be input into models like NiGEM for further analysis.
> 
> Task 5.1: Co-develop a flexible tool: The flexible tool will take the form of a sophisticated spreadsheet, incorporating @RISK Monte Carlo simulations. It would include (1) the projection scenarios produced in WP1, with the ability to adjust their assumptions; (2) the emulated relationships produced in WP2 for multiple bottom-up risks; (3) the trade spillover risks produced by incorporating top-down risks from WP2 into macroeconomic modeling under WP4. It would also include options to design sophisticated adaptation scenarios, consisting of channel-specific investments. The process for updating risk relationships and adding new ones will be simple and clearly documented. The flexible tool would produce tables and figures, as well as outputs designed to be used with mapping tools and NiGEM. The tool would be co-designed with HMT to ensure that it meets its needs now and in the future.
> Future work will use a custom-calibrated AI to translate narrative scenarios into quantitative inputs appropriate for exploration within the tool.
> 
> Task 5.2: Analyse adaptation policies: Using the tool, a number of adaptation policies will be explored that aim to help the UK government maximize the returns from investments in adaptation policy. This task would explore a range of policies to identify the maximum benefit-cost ratio, and to understand where vulnerable groups can be best supported by existing adaptation options and where new adaptation options are needed.
> Future work will develop explicitly optimise across the adaptation options included in the flexible tool under multiple budget constraints, to provide clearer policy advice.
> 
> Objectives and KPIs:
> 
> O1: Enhance Understanding of UK Macroeconomic Impacts of Climate Change: Shape the understanding of climate risks and their macroeconomic implications, including international spillovers and costs of autonomous adaptation.

**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a revised version of the "High-Level Framing and Problem Statement" and "Theory of Change and Strategy" sections that avoids duplicating points and provides a concise overview:
> 
> ---
> 
> **High-Level Framing and Problem Statement:**
> 
> In the United Kingdom, climate change presents substantial economic and fiscal risks that threaten both immediate stability and long-term prosperity. The impactful nature of climate-related risks underscores the urgent need for bespoke climate damage scenarios tailored to the UK context to facilitate informed fiscal policy and adaptation strategies. 
> 
> Current models, such as the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios, lack the specificity required to address the UK's unique challenges and overlook complex risk channels, including international spillovers essential for fiscal planning. Additionally, existing assessments, like the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) 2024 report, indicate significant gaps in data related to adaptation costs and benefits, preventing a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities and opportunities for proactive measures.
> 
> Therefore, this proposal seeks to integrate sector-specific impacts into a cohesive macroeconomic framework, enhancing evidence-based fiscal policy decisions and advancing knowledge on adaptation benefits and costs. This will support strategic decision-making, ensuring the UK efficiently allocates resources to bolster resilience and mitigate economic vulnerabilities from climate-related disturbances.
> 
> **Theory of Change and Strategy:**
> 
> The theory of change is based on the premise that robust, data-driven insights can fundamentally reshape decision-making about climate risks by providing clear, nuanced information on both economic impacts and adaptation benefits.
> 
> - **Interconnected Data and Models:** By synthesizing sectoral models and collaborating with experts, we will provide detailed and transparent climate damage scenarios, offering a nuanced view of economic impacts across the UK.
>   
> - **Evidence-Based Fiscal Assessment:** By rigorously evaluating fiscal implications from climate damages and adaptation costs, our insights will integrate climate considerations into fiscal policy, ensuring resource allocation reflects empirical data.
>   
> - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Establishing a multi-disciplinary steering group will foster cross-sectoral knowledge sharing, ensuring that findings resonate with policymakers and support a collective action approach.
>   
> - **Iterative Learning:** Constant integration of new data will keep models adaptive to evolving conditions, facilitating ongoing refinement of strategies and ensuring their relevance over time.
> 
> **Strategy:**
> 
> To bring this theory of change to life, the strategy will include:
> 
> 1. **Collaboration with Experts:** Engage leading researchers and policymakers to expand best practices and deepen understanding of adaptation investment needs.
>    
> 2. **Transparent Outputs:** Ensure modeling processes are transparent, delivering insights in accessible formats like spreadsheets, empowering stakeholders to leverage data effectively.
>    
> 3. **Education and Outreach:** Communicate findings to government bodies and industry stakeholders, driving adoption of insights and enhancing policy relevancy.
>    
> 4. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Establish feedback loops to incorporate stakeholder feedback and new data, refining tools and strategies over time, and ensuring they remain effective in managing the fiscal and economic risks of climate change.
> 
> This strategy will keenly address the identified problems, offering invaluable insights into climate-related economic and fiscal risks, and guiding resilient policy outcomes in the UK.

> Feel free to merge the revised sections into the overall document and adjust further if needed. Once you're ready, I'll assist with streamlining the "Objective" sections to maintain unity and clarity.
**user**:
> Great. Now, I have these two "Objectives" sections. Can I just replace the first Objective section (from before the WPs) with the second one (which was developed after the WPs), or do I miss something?
**assistant**:
> You can replace the first "Objectives" section with the second one that was developed after the work programmes, as it seems to provide a more comprehensive outline aligned with the revised framing and strategies. 
> 
> However, make sure to double-check that the new section captures all key aims and relevant metrics you want to maintain. Since the new objectives are likely aligned with the work programmes, it should create a more coherent narrative throughout the proposal.
> 
> Once you make that replacement, it's also beneficial to ensure that any references to the "Objectives" in other parts of the proposal (e.g., workflows, KPIs) are updated accordingly to reflect the changes. 
> 
> If you’d like, I can help you integrate any final adjustments or clarify specific objectives before you finalize the document!
