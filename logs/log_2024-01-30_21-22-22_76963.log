**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon a report (Dewberry Engineers 2018) which has identified the following issues and data requirements for offshore aquaculture siting:
> 
> Issues:
> • Identify areas suitable for aquaculture and mariculture
> • Identify species suitable for aquaculture
> • Understand and minimize impacts to
> aquaculture sites from proposed projects
> • Better understand ocean health and human
> impacts to water quality such as at sea fish processing					
> Data Requirements 
> • Jurisdictions and regulated areas
> • Abundance and distribution of marine species
> • Synthesized oceanographic parameters
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel
> Monitoring System (VMS)
> • Vessel Traffic – Automatic Identification
> Systems (AIS)
> • Human and cultural use areas
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel Trip
> Report (VTR)
> • Bathymetry
> • Sand and borrow sites
> • Species and habitat locations, including
> benthic habitat
> • Water quality, including marine debris, ocean
> acidification, harmful algal blooms, and oil
> spills
> • Geophysical (i.e. bottom type and sediment
> type)

> Can you summarize this material, citing the source, with a view toward data gaps relevant to Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process?
**assistant**:
> Certainly. Here's a concise summary,
> 
> *In the report by Dewberry Engineers (2018), several primary issues and data requirements were presented related to the siting of offshore aquaculture in Delaware's ocean and bay.*
> 
> *The issues identified revolve around the need to ascertain regions suitable for aquaculture and mariculture, identify appropriate species for such activities, comprehend, and minimize potential impacts of proposed projects on these sites. The report also emphasizes a better understanding of ocean health and anthropogenic influences on water quality, such as sea fish processing.*
> 
> *As for the data requirements, several areas of need were listed:*
> 
> *- Jurisdictions and regulated areas that outline the legal and regulatory controls over specific marine regions.*
> *- Abundance and distribution of marine species pivotal for setting up and maintaining sustainable aquaculture techniques.*
> *- Oceanographic parameters synthesized from a collection of maritime data.*
> *- Commercial fishing effort (known through Vessel Monitoring System - VMS, and Vessel Trip Report - VTR) to appropriately avoid conflicts with existing fishing regions.*
> *- Vessel traffic data obtained through Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) to prevent disturbances to marine transportation routes.*
> *- Recognizing human and cultural use areas to avoid potential conflicts with other uses of marine space.*
> *- Bathymetry data that can assist in understanding the underwater topographic contour, crucial for site selection.*
> *- Locations of sand and borrow sites, which could be potential areas of interest or potential areas to avoid.*
> *- Species and habitat locations, including benthic habitat data, to keep the planning mindful of existing bio-diversity and their habitat needs.*
> *- Monitoring of water quality, marine debris, acidification, harmful algal blooms, and oil spills to effectively manage the marine environment health.*
> *- Geophysical data, like bottom types and sediment types, that can influence site selection and sustainable practices.* 
> 
> *The report emphasises that there are existing gaps in these areas of data collection and management, which, if appropriately addressed, could significantly bolster the ocean and bay planning process, fostering sustainable aquaculture practices within Delaware’s marine waters.*
