>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

> Dear Professor Rising,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. My name is Rupsha Dey, and I am currently working as a Research Associate at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) at the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central monetary authority and apex policy-making institution. I have completed my Masters in Economics (MSc) with specialisation in Resource Economics and International trade theory.
> 
> A key achievement in my career was contributing to the RBI's Annual Flagship Policy Report for CAFRAL, where I co-authored a chapter on "Climate Change and Household Finance in India." This chapter addresses the challenges that climate risks create for economic stability and household financial health. Using nationwide household-level and spatial datasets, our research shows that Indian districts facing climate risks tend to have higher debt-to-asset ratios and decreasing land and real estate values. We found rural agricultural households are especially vulnerable, as climate change lowers crop yields and agricultural productivity. Our analysis also looks at whether credit access has changed in districts most affected by climate risks. Through regression analysis and a difference-in-difference approach with pin code-level data, we show that climate-vulnerable districts, particularly flood-prone ones, have seen a long-term drop in credit access, including loans for consumption, business, and mortgages.
> 
> Alongside my policy work at CAFRAL, I am also involved in a project assessing how all firms across India have responded to extreme heat shocks over the past two decades. We are analysing the impact of temperature and heat stress on firm-level factors such as sales, productivity, labor absenteeism, and sectoral shifts, particularly within the informal sector, a unique contribution of sorts in the Indian forefront.
> 
> My primary research interests lie at the intersection of Environmental Economics, Climate Policy, International Trade, and Macroeconomics, with a recent focus on how climate variability impacts household finance.
> 
> I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your research team. I have been deeply inspired by your work on models that assess the economic, environmental, and societal effects of climate variability and extreme weather events, with a strong focus on the intersections between climate risks, human behaviour, and economic systems. I would be honoured to contribute to your ongoing research aligned to climate economy models, food security issues and resource management. With my proficiency in analytical tools (R, Stata, and Python) along with my experience in policy analysis and research, I am confident I could make meaningful contributions to your work.
> 
> I have attached my CV for your review and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I might assist in your ongoing research. Thank you for considering my application.

**assistant**:
> It seems Rupsha Dey is indeed inquiring about research opportunities with you, specifically within the realm of Environmental Economics, Climate Policy, and related fields. Rupsha has a solid quantitative background and experience with climate impacts on economic systems, making her a potentially good fit for a Ph.D. program. She might align well with your research areas, particularly if she's interested in the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics, which is the preferred track for such applicants.
> 
> Here are the key points to address in your response:
> 
> 1. Encourage her to fill out the form to identify the appropriate program and understand key issues.
> 2. Briefly acknowledge her background and potential alignment with the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics track.
> 3. Mention the limited funding available for Ph.D. programs and suggest applying by December 1 for full consideration.
> 4. If relevant, ask if she's local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, or if she has studied at MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, though this doesn't appear necessary based on the provided information.
> 
> Here's a draft response for you:
> 
> ---
> 
> Dear Rupsha,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for sharing your impressive background and research experience. It sounds like you have a strong foundation at the intersection of Environmental Economics and Climate Policy, and your work aligns well with some of the research areas we explore here.
> 
> To help connect you with the best-suited academic program and potential supervision, I would appreciate it if you could fill out our prospective student form:
> 
> https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7
> 
> The Ph.D. in Environmental Economics might be a particularly good fit given your interests and experience. However, please note that funding for Ph.D. students is limited, so applying by December 1 will help ensure full consideration for available resources.
> 
> I look forward to learning more about your interests and discussing how we might align our research efforts.
