> I want a short word that conveys that a version of a file is simplified for development-only purposes (not for "production"-- although, production here means end-result academic research). Do you have suggestions?
**assistant**:
> Sure, here are some suggestions for a word that might convey your meaning:
> 
> 1. Prototype
> 2. Mockup
> 3. Draft
> 4. Alpha
> 5. Beta
> 6. Prelim (short for preliminary)
> 7. DevVersion (short for development version)
> 8. Sandbox
> 9. Debug
> 10. Test

> Each has slightly different connotations, but all could be used to convey a simplified or development-oriented version of a file.
