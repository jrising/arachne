> Dear Prof James Rising,

> I hope this email finds you well. My name is Min Thura Mon, and I am writing to express my strong interest in the PhD in Environmental Economics at University of Delaware. I came across your research on climate change and environment and I find it incredibly fascinating. Your expertise and contributions to the field have inspired me to pursue a graduate degree under your guidance.

> I am currently pursuing an MA in Economics at Chiang Mai University and hold an MSc in Environmental Management from Chulalongkorn University in Thailand. During my postgraduate studies, I developed a keen interest in Environmental and Energy Economics and worked on econometric models to address environmental issues, such as carbon capture capacity and the prediction of salinity in agricultural areas in Eastern Thailand, as the focus of my master's thesis. Additionally, I am currently working on Energy Poverty and Climate Change impact on poverty as part of the Burma Poverty Research program at Inya Economics, an economics think tank in Myanmar. I am excited to further my studies in Energy and Environmental Policy and Development Economics, with a research focus on (a) the economics of environmental and resource policy and on policy enforcement in Southeast Asia and (b) how low environmental quality, climate change, and government policies impact economic development, and poverty in Southeast Asia using quantitative methods.
> 
>  
> 
> Having reviewed the program requirements and course offerings of the PhD in Environmental Economics program, I believe it aligns well with my academic and career goals of becoming an Environmental Economist and Policy Expert. Myanmar, with its abundant natural resources, faces poor environmental quality, and there is a dearth of well-trained environmental and Development economists and policy experts to address these challenges. I want to be rigorously trained Environmental Policy Expert to tackle these environmental challenges not only for Myanmar but also for beyond its borders.

> Thank you very much in advance for your time and feedback. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

> Dear Mon,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. From the details of your research interests and academic background, you seem like you would be a good candidate for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. Your focus on environmental and resource policy, climate change, and economic development in Southeast Asia would align nicely with my work on climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
> 
> I must note that funding for the Ph.D. program is limited, especially for international applicants. However, don't be discouraged! This does not impact the selection procedure, but it is helpful to keep this in mind while planning your financial situation if admitted.
> 
> Given your qualifications and the alignment with my research interests, I recommend you to mention me in your statement of purpose. Our admission committee looks favorably upon applicants who have long-term research goals and have shown an explicit interest in working with a particular faculty member.
> 
> Please consider submitting your application by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funds.  
> 
> Lastly, I noticed that you're currently studying in Thailand. While I am based in Delaware, I am more than willing to work remotely as well, if that is a more feasible option for you.
