> I would like to include a glossary of terms in a perspective article I am writing called "Bridging the Disconnect: A Joint Perspective on Economic and Physical Sciences of Climate Risks", intended to be published simultaneously in a natural science and economics journal. I was imagining separate sections for (1) physical and biological science terms and (2) social science and economics. I am particularly interested in terms relevant to how each field understands climate risks but are likely to be misunderstood by the other field. Can you provide some suggestions for this glossary?
**assistant**:
> Of course, I can help with that! Here are some suggested glossary terms for each of the two sections.
> 
> #### (1) Physical and Biological Science Terms:
> 
> - **Climate Change**: Long-term alteration in the average weather patterns that a given region experiences. This can include alterations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, etc.
> 
> - **Greenhouse Effect**: A natural process where certain gases in a planet's atmosphere trap heat, preventing it from escaping into space. Human activities have exacerbated the natural greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.
> 
> - **Global Warming**: The long-term heating of Earth's average temperature due to increased amounts of carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions in the atmosphere.
> 
> - **Sea-level rise**: The long-term increase in the average water level of the Earth's oceans, which can erode coasts and cause more flooding.
> 
> - **Carbon Sequestration**: The process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide, reducing the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere.
> 
> - **Anthropogenic Influence**: The impacts and changes made by humans on natural systems.
> 
> - **Adaptive capacity**: The ability of a system to adjust, modify or change its characteristics or actions to moderate potential future harm, take advantage of opportunities, or cope with the consequences of shock or stress.
> 
> #### (2) Social Science and Economics Terms
> 
> - **Climate Justice**: The concept that the poor and powerless suffer the worst impacts of climate change, although they did the least to cause it.
> 
> - **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: Numerical approach to making decisions about investments and policy changes, where the costs and benefits of choices are compared.
> 
> - **Discount Rate**: An economist's way of stating how much future benefits and costs are worth today.
> 
> - **Externality**: Costs or benefits that affect a party not directly involved in a transaction or activity.
> 
> - **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: The total value of goods and services produced within a country during a specific period; often used as a measure of a country's economic performance.
> 
> - **Marginal Damage Cost**: The cost associated with one extra unit (e.g., a ton of carbon) of a pollutant.
> 
> - **Social Cost of Carbon**: Estimate of the economic damages that would result from emitting one additional ton of greenhouse gas.
> 
> - **Green Economy**: An economic system that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment.
> 
> This is not an exhaustive list by any means. Both fields have numerous terms that the other could misunderstand. Please let me know if you need more or specific terms!

> I think many of the terms at the top will be general knowledge and many across the list are unlikely to produce consternation. Here are some terms I think are important to add:
> Physical...:
>  - Exposure (and other elements of how the IPCC understands impacts)
>  - Biophysical/Process-based model (the predominant impact modeling approach coming from the sciences and engineering)
>  - Reasons For Concern (RFC) (maybe also relate these to planetary boundaries?)
> Economic...:

>  - Economic damages (note that it is not the same as financial loss or GDP)

> Great additions! Here are the additional terms for each section:
> 
> #### (1) Physical and Biological Science Terms:
> 
> - **Exposure**: The presence of people, assets, or systems (e.g., ecosystems) in places or settings that could be adversely affected by climate-related hazards, such as extreme weather events or sea-level rise.
> 
> - **Biophysical/Process-based model**: A modeling approach that incorporates physical and biological processes to simulate and analyze the impacts of climate change, such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and ecosystems.
> 
> - **Reasons For Concern (RFC)**: A framework developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that highlights specific vulnerabilities and risks associated with various levels of global warming. It provides a basis for understanding the urgency and severity of climate change impacts.
> 
> - **Planetary Boundaries**: A concept introduced by Johan RockstrÃ¶m and colleagues, which refers to a safe operating space for humanity within planetary boundaries. It identifies planetary-scale limits within which humans can thrive while maintaining a stable Earth system.
> 
> #### (2) Social Science and Economics Terms:
> 
> - **Marginal**: In economics, referring to the additional or incremental change resulting from an extra unit of a variable (e.g., the derivative of a function).
> 
> - **Social welfare function**: A tool used in economics to assess and compare societal well-being, taking into account various factors, values, and preferences of individuals.
> 
> - **Economic damages**: The negative consequences or losses caused by climate change, including impacts on human health, ecosystems, infrastructure, and economic sectors. It differs from financial loss or GDP, as it accounts for non-market values and long-term impacts.
> 
> Thank you for providing these important terms! I hope these additions further enhance your glossary and help bridge the understanding between the two fields in your article. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!
