> I am asking my IT department to provide a firewall exception so that I can serve webpages and Shiny apps from my office server. One of their questions is unclear to me: "Would you be open to adding additional agents to the host machine such as crowd strike or tenable?"

**assistant**:
> Your IT department is seeking your consent to install additional security measures on your Ubuntu server. The two names they mentioned, "Crowd Strike" and "Tenable," are cybersecurity platforms. 
> 
> "Crowd Strike" is a cloud-native endpoint security platform that provides high-level protection against threats. It uses AI and machine learning to detect and prevent potential breaches.
> 
> "Tenable" is another powerful cybersecurity platform widely used for vulnerability management. It identifies, investigates, and prioritizes vulnerabilities in your network. 
> 
> In general, adding such agents to your server would increase the security level and potentially lessen the likelihood of cyberattacks. However, they also might use up system resources that could slightly impact the performance of your server. They may also impose some restrictions on system usage based on security protocols, which could potentially interfere with server functionality.
> 
> Given this, the question to ask yourself is whether the enhanced security offsets any possible inconveniences from added system resource usage or potential restrictions. It might be beneficial for you to ask your IT department more about the specifics of how these implementations could affect your server and your work.
