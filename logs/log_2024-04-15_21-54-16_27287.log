**assistant**:
> Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is a quantitative measure that informs us about the contribution of each input parameter to the variability in model outcomes. However, it does not natively provide a segment for the variance that remains unexplained by any parameter. Here's why:
> 
> The main goal of GSA is to decompose the variance of the model output into fractions attributable to different input parameters, as well as their interactions. This is executed through techniques such as Sobol' indices. In most standard GSA methods like this, the total variance that is accounted for will sum to 1 (or 100%). 
> 
> The unexplained variance you are referring to is typically considered as the residual error, which includes variability in your output that's not explained by your inputs. 
> 
> However, when residuals are substantial, it indicates that the model may be missing key explanatory variables, there are unmodeled interactions or non-linear relationships, or the inherent randomness or measurement error is high.

> If you wish to evaluate this part of the unexplained variability, you might need to resort to methods such as Residual Analysis. Such analyses often involve adding error terms into your model or improving your model's sophistication to try and capture more of the variance in your output.
