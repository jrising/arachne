> CC005 - Exploring the Ecological Responses of Estuarine, Coastal and Open Ocean Waters to Climatic Drivers
> 
> Estuarine, coastal, and open ocean waters are experiencing climatic drivers that include changes in temperatures, salinity, nutrient loads, and acidification that causes alterations of pelagic and benthic habitats.  The ecological responses to these drivers vary and can include changes in biogeographic distribution of phytoplankton communities including proliferation of harmful algal blooms, alterations of phenology of phytoplankton and microphytobenthic blooms, algal toxin accumulation and transformations in the food webs. Moreover, these climate-related drivers exert discernible influences on primary and secondary production, as well as ecosystem respiration, ultimately giving rise to deoxygenation phenomena. This session will explore current research that delves into individual climatic drivers or explores the interaction among various drivers to the ecological processes of these ecosystems.  We welcome investigators utilizing diverse methodologies, including but not limited to field investigations, laboratory analyses, remote sensing applications, and modeling techniques, to contribute their insights to this session and foster a comprehensive understanding of ecological responses of estuarine, coastal and open ocean waters to climatic drivers.

> F001 - Emerging And Innovative Technologies for Sustainable Fisheries Managmement
> 
> The fisheries and aquaculture sectors have been emerging as an important industry to global food security in the twenty-first century. Since1950 the total global fisheries and aquaculture production has significantly increased from 19 million tonnes 1950 to about 179 million tonnes in 2018, with an annual growth rate of 3.3 percent. In 2019 the Fisheries Production declined by one percent in 2019 amounting to 177 million and them increased by 0.2 percent to reach 178 million tonnes in 2020. Fisheries and aquaculture contribute to most SDGs, in particular,  To recognize the importance of Fisheries, the SDG 14 (Life below water) contributes to the ocean and its marine resources. FAO is facilitating sustainable use of Fisheries. This session aims at discussion on Application of Innovative and Emerging Technologies for sustainable fisheries management and development. The session also focuses on policy implementation and Sustainable Development Goals in Fisheries Management. The session invites presentation on Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture Management and Development, impacts of climate change on Fisheries and Aquatic productions, recent advancement in technology for increasing Fisheries and Aquaculture production, effects of marine and coastal pollution on fisheries and aquaculture production.

**assistant**:
> Based on the descriptions you provided, the second session "F001 - Emerging And Innovative Technologies for Sustainable Fisheries Management" would be the most appropriate for your paper on impacts of climate change on fisheries. 
> 
> While the title might be a bit tangential at first glance, the session description specifically mentions discussing the impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquatic productions. Therefore, it should be a suitably relevant forum for your work. The emphasis on the practical applications of research to policy implementation and sustainable development will also allow your research to have meaningful resonance with the broader objectives of the conference.
