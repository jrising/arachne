> Dr. Rising,
> Greetings! I hope all is well with you. I obtained a master's degree in Finance and Banking from Begum Rokeya University, Bangladesh. I am extremely enthusiastic about PhD in Environmental Economics at University of Delaware, USA.
> I have reviewed your research profile and recent articles, especially about confounding adaptation in perennial climate damages. Your research area — Food System and Climate Change — has comprehensively held my research interest. I have approximately four years of experience as a research assistant in the fields of economics and finance. Now I wish to work under your guidance to acquire cutting-edge scientific research and analytical skills.

**assistant**:
> Dear Md. Emran Hosen,
> 
> Thank you for your interest and for reaching out. I'm delighted to hear about your enthusiasm for the research area of Food Systems and Climate Change, and your background and experience in economics seem well aligned with that. 
> 
> You've indicated an interest in the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware, and based on your profile, you indeed seem like a promising candidate. Just as an FYI, please be aware that while this is a thorough and enriching program, funding is limited. Regardless, I encourage you to send in your application in time for Fall admission, preferably by the end of the calendar year, to be considered for any available funds.
> 
> Also, based on your interest in my research, you may also want to consider the new and exciting Environmental Science & Management program which has a Marine track. This program offers wonderful opportunities for interdisciplinary quantitative modeling which aligns with your interest.
> 
> Should you be interested in any of our natural science programs within the Marine Science & Policy school, I would suggest reaching out to Dr. Xinfeng Liang at xfliang@udel.edu for more information and guidance.
