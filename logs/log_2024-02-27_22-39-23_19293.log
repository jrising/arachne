> WP4. Smallholder Economic Decision-Making - Economic Analysis of Fisheries and Food Crop Production (Lead: UD)
> There is still scarce knowledge on how climate change could impact the health of households in LLMICs, such as Senegal and Nigeria, due to the weakening of food security and increase in the gap between needed consumption and production of staple food (Whitmee et al 2015; Talukder et al 2022). To address this knowledge gap, WP4 will make novel advancements: First, we will analyze the decision-making process of staple food producers when determining their production and harvesting in response to biological and economic conditions in light of climate change. Second, we will identify what the sufficient and necessary conditions are for maintaining a simultaneous biological and economic equilibrium under different climate change scenarios. Third, we will evaluate incentives that can induce fishers and farmers to allocate their resources to harvest staple products with high nutrient contents without destabilizing the biological and economic equilibria.
> The analysis of the biophysical status of marine and agricultural resources and ecosystems in light of climate change will be delivered by WP2 and WP3. An economic analysis is essential to provide a better understand how smallholders use scarce resources d and how resources can be used more efficiently over the long run while facing undesirable climate change.. Economic analysis can also guide smallholders to make better harvesting and production choices based on their costs and benefits (Hannesson 1993). Smallholder decision-making is crucial as it determines their revenues, the food’s nutrient content, the populations’ final health outcomes, and the health of the marine and agriculture ecosystems. As such, WP4 will develop a new theoretical approach based on bioeconomic modeling (Clark 1976, 1990, 2010; Clark and Munro 1975, Munro 1990; Gordon 1954; Gordon 1956; Schaefer 1954; Knowler 2002; King et al 1993; Brown 2000; Castro et al 2018; Pfister et al 2005; Schönhart et al 2016), and an econometric analysis based on this modeling. To our knowledge such analyses have not yet been addressed in the literature, at least not for Senegal and Nigeria. These analyses will also directly contribute to achieving the SDGs 2, 14 and 15, if not more.
> OBJECTIVES:First, we will design and estimate bioeconomic models for the crop production in Nigeria and fisheries in Senegal for analyzing how smallholders in these sectors make decisions on production, harvesting and profitability in response to not only biological and biophysical constraints, but also to economic constraints, when climate change in addition affects such factors that are crucial for their operations. Second, we will study the patterns of and contributing factors to staple food (fisheries and agricultural crops) consumption today and in the future, and together with our results of our bioeconomic models, we will determine if there are possible gaps between production and needed consumption of staple-food.
> WP4.1: Develop two bioeconomic models to analyze how fishers and farmers maximize net economic yields while maintaining sustainable ecological yields, in light of climate change.
> Expected Outcomes:
> Derive the optimal yield and use of inputs and fish-catch, to serve as a framework to i) overcome overharvesting in light of climate change, and guide toward optimal catch activity required for stock rebuilding; and ii) evaluate production operations when there are negative rents or profits.
> Determine the optimal management of land use, inputs, and food crop production that can provide economic and environmental benefits, accounting for the impacts of climate change. 
> Analyze the impacts of quotas, subsidies and taxes, and financial market constraints.
> Measure the welfare effects on smallholders when prices and production change adversely due to climate change. Effects on the smallholders’ commercial activities and revenues.
> 
> Methodology:
> Task W4.1.1: Static and dynamic models simultaneously optimize both environmental and economic goals of the smallholders. The dynamic model accounts for that ecosystems characteristics and smallholders’ decisions in one year impact production and revenues in subsequent years.
> 
> Task W4.1.2: Econometric analysis of our theoretical bioeconomic models using data (at the smallholder level or spatial) provided by WP2 and WP3; and measure how climate change could affect the smallholders.
> WP4.2: Study the characteristics of and contributing factors (market prices, household incomes) to the current and future consumption of fish in Senegal, and food crops in Nigeria, and whether these are and will be met by current and future expected fish and food crop production. The results will be used as input in WP5.
> 
> 
> Expected Outcomes:
> Determine possible current consumption-production gaps, by considering not only the sustainability, profitability, and productivity of the fishing and agricultural sectors, but also the patterns of and contributing factors to the consumption of fish and staple crops.
> Estimate the short- and long-run income elasticities of demand for staple foods, and determine how responsive this demand is to changes in household incomes. The estimated long-run income elasticities will be used to project the long-run demand for staple food consumption and evaluate whether this will be met by future production up to 2050.
> Analyze to what degree staple food price rises would reduce staple food consumption and welfare. Staple food production could decrease due to climate change, and cause price rises.
> 
> Methodology:
> Task W4.2: Develop theory of household consumption demand, with emphasis on food demand. Translate this into an econometric specification. Perform an econometric analysis using local and survey datasets (e.g., the Demographic Health Survey (DHS). Any possible gaps in consumption data will be complemented by using the actual fish harvesting and food crop production using the methodology of Deaton and Zaidi (2002), FAO (2017) and Kébé (1998).
> 
> WP4.3: Extend our bioeconomic models to account for the possibility of implementing food nutrient requirements under different climate change scenarios.
> 
> Expected Outcomes: Determine the ratio of the staple food nutrient content to production yield, profits, and costs under the nutrient policy requirement policy, and alternative incentive policies (e.g., subsidies).
> 
> Methodology:
> Task W4.3: Our bioeconomic model will consider the smallholder as a profit-maximizer who seeks out alternative production technologies that can allow her/him to produce staple food that has high levels of rich nutrients to benefit households.

> WP4: Economic Analysis of Smallholder Decision-Making in Fisheries and Food Crop Production (Lead: UD)
> Understudied knowledge gaps exist in understanding how climate change affects food security and household health in LLMICs, like Senegal and Nigeria. WP4 will analyze staple food producers' economic decision-making, identify conditions for maintaining biological and economic equilibrium under climate change, and evaluate incentives for resource allocation towards nutrient-rich crops.
> 
> This research, building upon biophysical data from WP2 and WP3, enables us to understand how smallholders better utilize resources and make efficient, long-term production choices given climate change. Using bioeconomic modeling and econometrics, WP4 will produce novel analysis beneficial to smallholders and contributing to SDGs 2, 14, and 15.
> 
> Objectives: Analyze smallholder decisions on production and profitability under constraints and climate change for crop production in Nigeria and fisheries in Senegal. Study consumption patterns of staple foods today and in the future, and identify gaps between production and dietary needs.
> 
> WP4.1:
> * Develop bioeconomic models on optimal yields, inputs, and profit maximizing strategies given the pressure of climate change.
> * Outcomes include guidelines for sustainable catch and crop activities, analysis of policy impacts, and measurement of welfare effects due to climatic adversities.
> 
> WP4.2:
> * Assess patterns and contributing factors of present and future staple food consumption in Senegal and Nigeria.
> * Outcomes include identification of current production gaps, estimation of demand elasticities for staple foods, and analysis of food price effects on consumption and welfare.
> 
> WP4.3:
> * Extend the bioeconomic models to incorporate food nutrient requirements under different climate scenarios.
> * The outcome is to determine the relationship between nutritional content, food yields, profits, and costs under various policy and incentive scenarios.
> 
> Synthesis of existing financial and biophysical data, as well as potentially using localized survey data, will inform these models. Smallholder decision-making, while facing the dual pressures of climate change and maintaining nutrient-rich outputs, will be at the core of our investigation.
