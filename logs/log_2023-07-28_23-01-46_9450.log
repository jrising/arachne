> I am trying to set up a Passenger website, and it was working, but now when I go to the domain I just get a message "This site canâ€™t be reached DOMAIN refused to connect." Nothing is written to the error logs. However, I can access the site from my phone (but not my desktop). What's going on?

> It sounds like there are several possible problems at play here. Given the specifics of your situation (you can access the site on your phone but not your desktop), it appears your issue isn't with Passenger but potentially with your desktop or network setup. Here are some possibilities you could consider and investigate:
> 
> 1. **DNS Cache Issue:** Your desktop might have cached an old version of your website or its DNS resolution. Clearing the DNS cache might resolve the issue. On Windows, you can do this using the command `ipconfig /flushdns` in Command Prompt. On MacOS, the process varies by version, but you can generally do it with a command like `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`.
> 
> 2. **Hosts File:** Check that your `hosts` file on your desktop isn't overriding the address for your domain. On Windows, the hosts file is usually in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\`, while on MacOS it's usually at `/etc/hosts`.
> 
> 3. **Firewall or Security Software:** Your desktop's firewall or security software might be blocking access to the domain or website. You could temporarily disable these (carefully!) to see if they're causing the problem.
> 
> 4. **Network Settings:** Your desktop network (either a wired Ethernet connection or a WiFi connection) could have a unique configuration or issue causing this problem. You could try resetting your network settings or connecting to a different network to test this.
> 
> 5. **Browser Extensions:** Some browser extensions can block access to certain sites. Try accessing the site in an "incognito" or "private" browser window, or disable extensions, to see if this might be the issue. 
> 
> Remember: changes like clearing the DNS Cache or modifying the hosts file can affect your system's behavior and might require a system restart to take effect, so consider these actions carefully.
