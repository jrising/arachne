> I know Var(y) and Var(y + ytilde). Does the difference tell me Var(ytilde)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it can. If \( y \) and \( \tilde{y} \) are independent random variables, you can find \( \text{Var}(\tilde{y}) \) using the formula for the variance of the sum of two independent random variables:

> \text{Var}(y + \tilde{y}) = \text{Var}(y) + \text{Var}(\tilde{y})

> 
> By rearranging this formula, you can solve for \( \text{Var}(\tilde{y}) \):
> 
> \[
> \text{Var}(\tilde{y}) = \text{Var}(y + \tilde{y}) - \text{Var}(y)

> So, if you know \( \text{Var}(y) \) and \( \text{Var}(y + \tilde{y}) \), you can find \( \text{Var}(\tilde{y}) \) by calculating the difference \( \text{Var}(y + \tilde{y}) - \text{Var}(y) \).

> Ensure that \( y \) and \( \tilde{y} \) are independent for this calculation to be valid. If they are not independent, you would need additional information about their covariance.
