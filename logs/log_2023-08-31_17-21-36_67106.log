> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters, for the purpose of marine spatial planning. I have generated maps of the location of some activities that occur at the surface of the ocean and Bay (ocean disposal sites, navigation channels, wind leases, and danger zones) and on the floor of the ocean (waste water pipes, wind power structures, submarine cables). Can you write a paragraph providing an introduction to how spatial interactions between marine activities need to be accounted for?

> Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a critical activity for ensuring the sustainable use of ocean resources, especially in densely utilized areas like Delaware's marine waters. Each human activity in these waters, whether transpiring at the surface or ocean floor, occupies a particular spatial extent and, importantly, interacts with other activities occurring nearby. For example, navigation channels must be clear of submarine cables or wind power structures, and ocean disposal sites need to be positioned considerately with regard to possible impacts on underwater infrastructure or designated danger zones. These spatial interactions can introduce complex trade-offs and interdependencies, potentially leading to conflicts if not appropriately managed. Understanding and mapping these activities is therefore an essential first step in spatial managementâ€”in order to minimize adverse interactions, optimize benefits from these activities, and protect the long-term health of the marine ecosystem. By assessing the spatial dynamics involved, MSP can help identify compatible uses of marine space, negotiate conflicting interests, and navigate towards ecological, economic, and social objectives in harmony.
