**user**:
> I want to build a function in R that takes two functions as arguments: the random draw function for a distribution (e.g., rnorm) and the distribution function (e.g., dnorm). My function should also take the arguments that would be passed to both (e.g, mean, stddev), but that changes by distribution function. How can I pass in arbitrary arguments to my function and then pass these into the two random number functions?
**assistant**:
> Sure, the `...` (ellipsis) operator in R allows you to do this. It captures arbitrary arguments passed to a function and allows you to pass them to another function. Here's an example of how to do this:
> 
> ```R
> myfunc <- function(f1, f2, ...) {
>   # Pass the arbitrary arguments to each function
>   result1 <- f1(...)
>   result2 <- f2(...)
>   
>   # Combine the results in a list (or process them as required)
>   list(result1 = result1, result2 = result2)
> }
> ```
> 
> Now you can use this function by passing in the functions `rnorm` and `dnorm`, along with their parameters:
> 
> ```R
> set.seed(1)
> res <- myfunc(rnorm, dnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1, n = 5) # n is specific to rnorm
> print(res$result1) # these are the random draws
> print(res$result2) # these are the density values
> ```
> 
> In this case, the `mean = 0` and `sd = 1` arguments are passed to both `rnorm` and `dnorm`. The additional `n` argument is passed to `rnorm` to specify the number of random deviates.
> 
> Note that you'll need to set a seed (`set.seed()`) if you want to generate reproducible random numbers.
> 
> However, note that not all function arguments will be applicable for both random draw functions and distribution functions, so proceed with this approach with that in mind. If you have specific definitions of each argument for each function, it might be better to separate them out instead of using the ellipsis, or to use a strategy for parsing the ellipsis arguments within your function.
