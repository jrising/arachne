**assistant**:
> Coasean contracts, often used in business environments, represent a suitable example of self-enforcing agreements in contract theory. 
> 
> The Coase theorem, named after Ronald Coase, a Nobel laureate in Economics, emphasizes that under certain conditions (like no transaction costs), parties will naturally negotiate optimal agreements without outside enforcement. They do this to maximize their mutual benefit, and these contracts are inherently self-enforcing because any deviation would hurt both parties.

> Consider a contractual agreement between two businesses: Business A, a polluting factory, and Business B, a nearby fishing business harmed by the pollution. According to the Coase theorem, A and B can negotiate a solution irrespective of initial property rights allocation. If pollution rights are allocated to Business A, it might agree to reduce pollution if Business B compensates sufficiently. Conversely, if Business B has pollution rights, Business A might pay to continue certain levels of pollution. This contract is self-enforcing because either business breaching the contract would face financial loss.

> However, it's essential to note that these 'perfect' Coasean contracts largely exist in a theoretical backdrop. Real-world contracts encounter transaction costs and information asymmetry. Yet, many contracts incorporate elements of this self-enforcing principle, such as performance-based contracts where both parties benefit from continued contract adherence.
