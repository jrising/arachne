> What is a good way to make a country-level global map in ggplot, where countries are colored based on a column, and the country is specified by ISO code in another column?
**assistant**:
> To create a country-level global map in ggplot using ISO codes and based on coloring by a certain column, we're going to use three main libraries: `ggplot2`, `rnaturalearth`, and `rnaturalearthdata`. Here's a sample process on how you could go about it:
> 
> ```R
> 
> # Load the necessary libraries
> library(ggplot2)
> library(rnaturalearth)
> library(rnaturalearthdata)
> 
> # Get world map data
> world_map <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
> 
> # Add your data
> # Let's say your data frame is called 'df', it has ISO codes in a column 'iso', and values to color by in 'value'
> merged_data <- merge(world_map, df, by.x = "iso_a3", by.y = "iso")
> 
> # Create the map
> ggplot(data = merged_data) +
>   geom_sf(aes(fill = value)) +
>   coord_sf(datum=NA) +  # Or use coord_quickmap for a quick & dirty map
>   viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +  # To generate pretty colors, consider the viridis package
>   theme_minimal() +
>   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
>   labs(fill = "Your Legend Title")
> ```
> 
> This code will merge your dataframe with the world map data by ISO code, and then create a map using ggplot where countries are filled in with a color representing their 'value'. You will need to replace `'value'` with the name of the actual column in your dataframe. With `rnaturalearth`, the ISO code for each country is in the 'iso_a3' column.
> 
> Remember that your dataframe should be structured in a way that it has a row for each country, a column for the ISO codes, and a column for the values that you want to use to color the countries.
> 
> Also note the use of `scale_fill_viridis()`, this is a nice palette for grading colors, but you can of course use any palette you prefer or even specify your own colors. `theme_minimal()` creates a nice clean theme, while `labs(fill = "Your Legend Title")` allows us to add a title for our color legend.
**user**:
> What if I already have the shapefile downloaded?
**assistant**:
> If you already have the shapefile downloaded and want to use it to create a country-level global map in ggplot based on a column in your dataset, you can skip the step of downloading the world map data using `rnaturalearth` and instead directly work with your shapefile. Here's how you can modify the previous code to incorporate your downloaded shapefile:
> 
> ```R
> # Load the necessary libraries
> library(ggplot2)
> library(sf)
> 
> # Load your downloaded shapefile
> world_map <- st_read("path_to_your_shapefile.shp")
> 
> # Add your data
> # Let's say your data frame is called 'df', it has ISO codes in a column 'iso', and values to color by in 'value'
> merged_data <- merge(world_map, df, by.x = "iso_a3", by.y = "iso")
> 
> # Create the map
> ggplot(data = merged_data) +
>   geom_sf(aes(fill = value)) +
>   coord_sf(datum=NA) +  # Or use coord_quickmap for a quick & dirty map
>   viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +  # To generate pretty colors, consider the viridis package
>   theme_minimal() +
>   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
>   labs(fill = "Your Legend Title")
> ```
> 
> In the code snippet above, you would replace `"path_to_your_shapefile.shp"` with the actual file path to your downloaded shapefile. The rest of the process remains the same as in the previous response, where you merge your dataframe with the shapefile by ISO code and then create the map in ggplot based on the specified column for coloring the countries.
> 
> This approach allows you to use your own downloaded shapefile for mapping, giving you more control and flexibility over the map customization.
