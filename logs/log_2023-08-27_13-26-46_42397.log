> The socioeconomic perspective that places the economic system as a subset of the natural world is known as "ecological economics". Ecological economics is a form of economics that recognizes the economy as a subsystem of the Earth's larger ecosystem, and emphasizes the preservation of natural capital. One goal of ecological economics is sustained well-being, which depends on a flow of goods and services derived from both manufactured and natural capital.

> Ecological economics distinguishes itself from traditional neoclassic economics, or "brown" economics, which largely neglects the importance of nature's resources, treating the economy as a separate entity.

> Doughnut Economics is indeed rooted in ecological economics. It’s a visual framework for sustainable development – shaped like a doughnut or lifebelt – combining the concept of planetary boundaries with the complementary concept of social boundaries. The model was developed by Oxford economist Kate Raworth in her 2012 paper and subsequent 2017 book, "Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist".

> - Humanity's 21st century challenge is to meet the needs of all within the means of the planet. In other words, to ensure that no one falls short on life's essentials (from food and housing to healthcare and political voice), while ensuring that collectively we do not overshoot our pressure on Earth's life-supporting systems, on which we fundamentally depend – such as a stable climate, fertile soils, and a protective ozone layer.

> Both ecological economics and doughnut economics bring a broader view of the economy's place within the world, considering environmental and social factors not adequately addressed in traditional economic thinking. They are more holistic approaches to understanding and managing the world's assets.
