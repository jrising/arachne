> Is there a closed-form solution to the matrix inversion: (k - I_N), where k is a scalar?
**assistant**:
> Yes, if `k` is a scalar and `I_N` is the `N x N` identity matrix, the inverse of `(k - I_N)` exists as long as `k â‰  1`. The inverse of a scalar multiplied by the identity matrix is just the inverse of the scalar itself multiplied by the identity matrix. However, because we are subtracting the identity matrix from `k`, the inverse is slightly different.

> This results since each main diagonal element in `(k - I_N)` is `(k - 1)` and all off-diagonal elements are `-1`, so the matrix is still of a diagonal form which makes it directly invertible. Be aware that `k` must not be equal to `1` because in that case you would have division by zero.
