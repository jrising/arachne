**user**:
> Is there a difference between using "%>%" and "|>" in dplyr in R?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is a difference between the two operators in the context of R programming and more specifically with the `dplyr` package, but it primarily comes down to visual preference and compatibility with earlier versions of R.
> 
> `%>%`, referred to as the pipe operator, is part of the `magrittr` package, and is extensively used for chaining operations in `dplyr` and other tidyverse packages. The pipe operator makes the code easier to read, especially with complex data transformations.

> Here's an example:
> 
> ```R
> data %>% 
>   group_by(x) %>%
>   summarise(y = mean(z))
> ```
> 
> In R version 4.1.0 and later, the native pipe operator `|>` was introduced. Its behavior is similar to `%>%`. It can be used instead of `%>%`. Here's the same example above using the new native pipe:
> 
> ```R
> data |> 
>   group_by(x) |> 
>   summarise(y = mean(z))
> ```
> 
> However, the native pipe operator `|>` has some differences from `%>%`, due to some subtle differences in the way it handles the evaluation of arguments. In most common use cases, they are interchangeable, but intricate differences can become apparent in more complex operations. Most notably, you can't use `.` placeholder with `|>`, while you can with `%>%`. 
> 
> It's also important to note that the `%>%` is much more established in the R community and has broader compatibility, with many existing codebases and tutorials using it, whereas `|>` is relatively new. So you might prefer to use `%>%` for maximum compatibility and community support, especially if you are sharing your code or using an older version of R. 
> 
> In terms of performance, there's negligible difference between the two, and the choice between the two depends on your personal style, and potentially, the conventions followed in your codebase or by your team.
