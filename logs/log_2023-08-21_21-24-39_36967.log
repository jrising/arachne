> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. I have a section on beach nourishment and artificial reefs. The data on beach nourishment only go back to 2019, but show projects along the coast and (to a lesser extent) at several points in the bay. The artificial reefs are mainly in the bay, but with some projects in deeper waters. Here are additional details on the datasets:

> Beach nourishment dataset:
> Beach nourishment projects occur throughout coastal states in the United States. These projects can be privately, federally, or state funded. Material used in nourishment comes from a variety of sources (inland sources, dredged navigational channels, or offshore sites). This data set combines historical data compiled in the Western Carolina University Beach Nourishment Viewer database, as well as the National Beach Nourishment Database generated by the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association. The data contain attribute information on the general location of sand placement, primary funding source and funding type, volume of sediment emplacement (in cubic yards), length of beach nourished (in feet), and cost and inflated cost for over 2,000 beach nourishment episodes dating back to 1923.

> Artificial reefs dataset:
> Artificial reefs provide new or enhanced hardbottom habitat to areas that may or may not be habitat limited. Artificial habitat provides space that is quickly colonized by sessile organisms and provides new food sources, greater protection of juveniles by providing more space to be used as refuge, and a possible focal point for aggregating adults to spawn. These data were obtained using a variety of methods, including downloading data from state websites, getting data directly from state and NOAA contacts, and conducting internet research.

> In Delaware's marine waters, two promising activities have been contributing to the region's ecological health and stability: beach nourishment and artificial reef emplacement. Beach nourishment, essentially the transportation of sediment from various sources (inland, dredged navigational channels, or offshore sites) to eroded coastlines, has played a significant role in the restoration and preservation of coastal regions. Data from the Western Carolina University Beach Nourishment Viewer and the National Beach Nourishment Database reveal that initiatives have been undertaken along the coast and certain locations in the bay since 2019, funded by private, state, and federal entities. These projects involve augmenting beaches with sediment â€“ calculated in cubic yards, and cover lengths of beach in feet, with estimates of over 2,000 nourishment episodes dating back to 1923. On the other hand, significant investments have been made to introduce or enhance artificial reefs, mainly in the bay and a few in deeper waters. These generated habitats, rapidly colonized by sessile organisms, serve multiple purposes: they offer food sources, afford greater protection to juvenile marine life by providing space to be used as refuge, and might create potential nodes for adult species to congregate and spawn. This data collection resulted from various methods of research, including perusal of state-specific and NOAA-related data, as well as internet-based investigations.
