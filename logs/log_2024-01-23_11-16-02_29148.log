> 2. Course Description
> Description
> This course provides an economics perspective on the major challenges of climate change. For each topic covered, the course discusses economic understanding, current developments, and policy implications. Topics will include climate impacts and adaptation, with connections to econometric approaches; mitigation pathways, carbon taxes, and cap & trade systems, discussing computational and analytical modeling; firm behavior, including technology adoption and learning; and international coordination problems, with applications of game theory. 
> 
> Students will engage with quantitative models through hands-on practicums. These are aimed at better understanding features of the climate-economy system, the role of uncertainty, and the potential and limits to policy. Through the semester, students will learn to use R, a statistical programming language, including data handling and visualization, mathematical modeling, and optimization.
> Prerequisites
> 
> APEC/ECON343 Environmental Economics or permission of the instructor.
> Course Delivery
> 
> This course will combine in-person lectures with regular hands-on practicums. The practicums will be held online.
> 
> The lectures for this class meet jointly with Climate Change Economics MAST 688. However, assignments and the final exam will be different between the two classes. 
> 3. Learning Outcomes
> After completing this course, students will be able to:
> ●	Explain the basic science of climate change and its significance for economic decisions.
> ●	Describe the relationship between physical risks, exposure, sensitivity, and economic consequences.
> ●	Describe the economic risks of climate change, and how we know about them.
> ●	Discuss the relative benefits of statistical and process-based approaches to future projection.
> ●	Explain the ethical significance of aspects like the discount rate, inequality over generation, location, and climate outcome.
> ●	Explain the comparative advantages of carbon taxes and cap & trade systems.
> ●	Discuss the incentives on firm-level decision-making under standard climate policy regimes.
> ●	Explain the international cooperation challenges behind mitigation.
> ●	Handle data, perform simulations and optimizations, and visualize results in R.
> ●	Understand all components of an integrated assessment model.
> 4. Learning Resources
> Required Learning Materials
> The primary textbooks for the class will be
> •	Climate Economics: Economic Analysis of Climate, Climate Change and Climate Policy, Third Edition (2023), by Richard Tol. Edward Elgar Publishing. ISBN 978-1802205435. ($50 - $100, available at the UD Bookstore).
> •	The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review (2007), by Nicholas Stern. Available at https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20100407172811/https:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/stern_review_report.htm
> 
> In addition, readings from the concurrent graduate version of the course (MAST 688), drawn from the academic literature, will also be available for further exploration.
> Technology
> 
> A basic understanding of the R language will be taught in the practicums, as well as being used to better understand content from the course. Many R tutorials are available online, and some of these will be pointed to during the practicums.
> 
> Canvas: In this class, Canvas, UD's online learning management system, will be used for all course activities and communication channels. All assignments will be posted through the Canvas course site unless otherwise directed.  Information on how to use Canvas is available through the Canvas Student Guide. Canvas can also be accessed via MyUD. 
> Office Hours
> Office hours are a dedicated time during the week for students to ask questions or engage in discussion about course content with their faculty member, TA, or other learning assistant. 
> 
> Office hours take place in-person in Robinson 305 on Thursdays at 11:30 – 1pm.
> 
> I am also happy to take appointments. You can find a time by going to https://zcal.co/i/yT7oGlwL.
> 5. Learning Assessment
> Learning assessment will consist of short weekly quizzes, 6 lab assignments, and a final exam.
> 
> The homework assignments will ask students to delve more deeply into the material or quantitative methods, and cover the following topics:
> ●	Uncertainty in climate science
> ●	Econometric estimation of weather risks
> ●	Cost-benefit analysis of mitigation pathways
> ●	Cap & trade firm-level simulation
> ●	Integrated assessment modeling
> ●	International cooperation game theory
> 
> Final Grade Breakdown
> 
> The final course grade will be calculated using the following components:
> 
> Course Component	Percentage of Total
> Attendance & participation (~0.5% per week)	8%
> Weekly review quizzes (12 quizzes, 1% each)	12%
> Lab assignments (6 assignments, 8% each)	60%
> Final exam	20%
> 
> Attendance & participation
> Attendance will be marked for each lecture and practicum. In addition, students are expected to engage actively in the practicum exercises, which will variously involve participating in group work, explaining issues to the class, and helping other students.
> Weekly review quizzes
> Weekly review quizzes will consist of a few short questions checking the understanding of the reading for each lecture and the key points of the previous lecture. These are intended to be easy checks that you were paying attention to readings and lectures.
> Lab assignments
> Lab assignments will take the form of a semi-directed programming task, building on the exercises in the practicums and providing further insight into the topics of the class.
> 
> Final Exam
> The course will have a comprehensive final exam. One page of notes is allowed. A practice exam will be shared in the last month of the course, and additional details about the format of questions, level of depth, and topics covered will be discussed in the final review session.
