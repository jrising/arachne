> I would like to submit a paper which is basically a "perspective" article, but I want to submit it to an economics journal, which generally do not have this category. Are there top economics journals with appropriate article categories?
**assistant**:
> Most economics journals tend to focus on research papers that contribute to the existing literature in a substantive way. However, there are a few leading journals that do accept submissions akin to "perspective" articles. These articles generally involve offering a new viewpoint on established theories or critiquing the methods or interpretations of previous research. Below are some of the top economics journals that may entertain such submissions:
> 
> 1. **The Journal of Economic Perspectives (JEP)**: The JEP fills the gap between the general interest press and academic economics journals, offering accessible, relevant, and useful economic research.
> 
> 2. **The Journal of Economic Literature (JEL)**: The JEL publishes survey articles and essays on emerging fields in economics. It is a great venue for pieces that offer new perspectives.
> 
> 3. **Economic Policy**: Economic Policy promotes discussion of practical policy issues derived from rigorous economic analysis.
> 
> 4. **Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA)**: BPEA welcomes articles that are policy-oriented, integrate findings, and offer novel perspectives.

> Before submission, I would recommend reaching out to the editorial team of the desired journal to express your intention and get their viewpoint.
