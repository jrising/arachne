> I am writing a report on the losses that countries have already felt due to climate change. Here is the original proposal:
> ---
> Estimating Current Climate Losses - Project Proposal
> PI: James Rising, University of Delaware
> 
> Context: The planet has already warmed by 1.34 Â°C [1.2 - 1.5 Â°C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. Under one expert review of global damages, this suggests that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion. In poor, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be significantly greater.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> Deliverable: This project will develop best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome will be percent reductions in GDP per capita and percent reductions in capital wealth, in 2023, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP per capita is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels. A recent estimate of GDP losses, combining three of these results and produced by the PI for a previous ECF-funded project on the cost of climate change in the UK, is shown below.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses will provide new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change. The losses would also be reported as a global average and for various regional and country groups (e.g., LLMICs, G77, Sub-Saharan Africa).
> 
> Annually varying loss estimates will underlie these results, which will reflect greater losses in years with heat waves and in later years as climate change accelerates. We will develop short case studies from the EU and LLMICs will compare these GDP losses to other reported impacts of recent heat waves.
> 
> The estimates will be produced as part of a short report made initially available to the sponsors Nov. 1, 2023, and for release during COP 28. The work will then be prepared for academic publication.
> 
> Unique contribution: To produce these results, we bring together existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate (see Table under Points of Methodology). Over the past decade, this literature has proposed many different approaches to understanding the effect of climate on GDP, including investigations of the differential vulnerability of poor countries, the role of persistent losses to growth, and the potential of adaptation. Current attempts to synthesise this literature are limited to simply averaging the results. Using a machine learning model, calibrated to the results from this literature, we will produce an estimate that reflects the most advanced features of all of these papers.
> 
> The PI has developed a system for generating projections from this class of models for the UK climate impacts project. The machine learning approach is based on another of the PIâ€™s projects, producing a best-estimate of the social cost of carbon.

> The table shows an assessment of the quality of each modelâ€™s representation of temperature variables (Temp.), rainfall (Prec.), additional controls (Addâ€™l), unobserved heterogeneity (FE), and underlying data (Data). No single existing estimate captures the full range of relevant factors that has been identified in the literature.
> 
> We will use ERA5 reanalysis weather data to produce historical projections of climate effects, available 1940 - present. To construct the counterfactual without climate change, we will resample values from the baseline period (1940 - 1960). A key question in the literature is the extent to which impacts put countries on a permanently lower growth trajectory. This was carefully analysed in a previous paper of the PIâ€™s, and the resulting uncertain distribution of persistence will be used here.
> 
> Drawing upon both the headline estimates and additional results in the paper will provide evidence across the space of possible combinations of model elements. A random forest model will then be fit to these models, informed by meta-data about each. Finally, the random forest will be queried for damages from a model that simultaneously represents high-quality features in all model categories.
> 
> As an additional line of evidence, we will use the previously mentioned Howard & Sterner meta-analysis of damage results derived from expert elicitation. This provides both a measure of catastrophic risk, which will be applied uniformly across the globe, and an estimate of non-catastrophic global losses, which can be used as a loose constraint on the sum of the machine learning results.
> 
> These GDP values, along with additional information from the World Bank, will be used to calibrate country-specific Solow growth models, and this will be used to infer the loss to the total capital base that these GDP results imply.
