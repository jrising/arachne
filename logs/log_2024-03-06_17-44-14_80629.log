**user**:
> What latex package is "larger" from?
**assistant**:
> The command `\larger` is provided by the `relsize` package in LaTeX. This package contains commands that adjust the size of the font relative to the current size. Here is how to use it:
> 
> ```latex
> \usepackage{relsize}
> ...
> \larger[<optional scale factor>] {Your text here}
> ```
> 
> If you don't provide a scale factor, `\larger` defaults to incrementing the font size by 1 relative unit.
