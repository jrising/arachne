> Weitzman's Dismal Theorem is a concept in environmental economics, specifically in the context of climate change. The theorem is named after economist Martin L. Weitzman, who introduced the idea in his 2009 paper "On Modeling and Interpreting the Economics of Catastrophic Climate Change."
> 
> The Dismal Theorem suggests that in situations where the probability of an extremely negative outcome is uncertain, but potentially catastrophic, the expected value of the situation may be infinite, making it nearly impossible to calculate the optimal policy response.
> 
> In the context of climate change, the theorem suggests that because the potential consequences of failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could be catastrophic, policymakers cannot rely solely on cost-benefit analysis to determine the appropriate level of mitigation efforts. This is because there is a small but finite possibility of a catastrophic event that would outweigh any benefits of mitigation efforts.
> 
> Therefore, Weitzman argues that policymakers must take a precautionary approach and aim to reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change as much as possible, even if this requires significant costs in the short term. The Dismal Theorem underscores the urgency of taking action to address climate change and highlights the need for more aggressive mitigation efforts.
