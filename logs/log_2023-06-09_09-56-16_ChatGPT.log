> 2. **Handprint/Footprint Jewelry**: There are online stores that make custom jewelry using the handprints or footprints of your little ones. This can be a very special and personalized gift.
> 
> 3. **Storybook featuring the Grandkids**: There are companies that create custom storybooks where you can put your kids as characters in the book. You could make a book where they go on an adventure with their grandmother.
> 
> 4. **DIY Gifts from Grandchildren**: Anything made by your kids would surely melt her heart. You could have them make a picture, a necklace, a painted flower pot, or any other craft.
