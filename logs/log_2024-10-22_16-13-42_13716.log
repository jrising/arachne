> My toilet fairly regularly gets into a situation where it keeps running. I can always fix this, usually by re-sitting the stopper in the upper basin, but my wife seems uninterested in learning how to do this, so there have been more and more times when it just keeps running. I don't know if I should replace the toilet. I thought I could just replace the internal mechanism, but when I went to Home Depot, they seemed to only have the part of the mechanism that floats. What should I do?
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you're dealing with a common issue where the flapper (or stopper) in the toilet tank is not sealing properly, which causes the toilet to run continuously. Here are a few steps you can follow to address this issue:
> 
> 1. **Inspect the Flapper**: Check the flapper for any signs of wear or damage. If it's warped, cracked, or doesn't sit properly over the flush valve seat, it might not seal well.
> 
> 2. **Clean the Flapper and Valve Seat**: Sometimes mineral buildup or debris can prevent the flapper from sealing properly. Clean both the flapper and the valve seat with a sponge or cloth.
> 
> 3. **Chain Adjustment**: Make sure the chain connecting the flapper to the flush handle is properly adjusted. If it's too tight or too loose, it might prevent the flapper from seating correctly.
> 
> 4. **Replace the Flapper**: If cleaning and adjusting the chain don't work, it might be time to replace the flapper. Flappers are widely available at hardware stores and are relatively inexpensive and easy to install. They come in standard sizes (usually 2-inch or 3-inch), so make sure to get the right size for your toilet.
> 
> 5. **Consider a Full Rebuild Kit**: If issues persist, and especially if your toilet is an older model, you might consider getting a full toilet repair kit. These kits often include a new flapper, float, fill valve, and other essential parts. They can give your toilet a fresh start and are typically more comprehensive than just replacing individual pieces.
> 
> Remember, replacing the whole toilet is rarely necessary for a running issue like this unless there are other significant problems such as cracks in the bowl or tank. If you're unsure about doing these repairs yourself, hiring a plumber to take a look might also be a good option.
> 
> Would you like guidance on any specific part of the replacement or repair process?
**user**:
> I see complete repair kits that seem reasonable. How do I know if I want 2-inch or 3-inch?
**assistant**:
> To determine whether you need a 2-inch or 3-inch flapper repair kit, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Check the Existing Flapper**: 
>    - Remove the tank lid and inspect the flapper located at the bottom of the tank.
>    - Measure the diameter of the flush valve opening where the flapper sits. 
> 
> 2. **Size Identification**:
>    - **2-Inch**: Most older toilets and many standard models typically use a 2-inch flapper.
>    - **3-Inch**: Some newer models and high-efficiency toilets (HETs) feature a 3-inch flush valve for better performance.
> 
> 3. **Visual Comparison**: 
>    - If you’re unsure, take the existing flapper to the store for comparison, or check for markings on the flapper itself that might indicate the size.
> 
> 4. **Model Information**:
>    - You can also check the manufacturer’s information on your toilet, which is often stamped on the inside of the tank or on a label. This can help pinpoint the correct part size.
> 
> 5. **Ask for Help**: 
>    - If you’re at the store and still unsure, don't hesitate to ask a staff member for assistance. They can help you find the right repair kit based on what you’ve observed.
> 
> Choosing the right size is crucial for ensuring a proper seal and preventing the running issue from recurring. If all else fails, a universal repair kit may be a flexible option, as it usually includes adapters for different sizes. 
> 
> If you have access to a ruler or measuring tape, I can guide you on how to check the size more precisely!
**user**:
> Okay, I think I have a 3-inch. It's not that the flapper doesn't sit exactly. It's that the hinge of the flapper pops off of the bar its supposed to hold onto. I'm worried that another flapper would get the same problem.
**assistant**:
> If the hinge of the flapper keeps popping off the bar, this could indicate a couple of issues:
> 
> 1. **Worn-out Hinge**: The hinge itself might be worn or damaged, which can prevent a secure fit. If this is the case, a replacement flapper with a stronger or compatible hinge should solve the issue.
> 
> 2. **Misalignment**: Sometimes, the flapper isn’t aligned correctly over the flush valve, which can cause it to pop off during use. Make sure that the flapper is aligned properly and that the chain length is correct—too much slack or tension can lead to misalignment.
> 
> 3. **Improper Chain Length**: If the chain connecting the flapper to the flush lever is too short, it might be pulling the flapper off its hinge when you flush. Try adjusting the chain length to allow a smoother movement. 
> 
> 4. **Replacement Options**: When choosing a new flapper, look for ones designed specifically for your toilet model or those that have reinforced hinges. Some brands offer more durable options that may address hinge issues better than standard models.
> 
> ### Recommendations:
> - **Check Compatibility**: When purchasing a new flapper, consider brands that offer compatibility features for your toilet model.
> - **Look for Reinforced Options**: Products designed with reinforced hinges or reliable mounting systems can provide better long-term performance.
> - **Self-adjusting Models**: Some flappers automatically adjust for optimal sealing; these can be a good choice to avoid similar issues.
> 
> ### Next Steps:
> 1. **Purchase a New Flapper**: Choose one that you feel confident will fit well.
> 2. **Install Carefully**: When installing, ensure that everything aligns properly, and adjust the chain length to avoid pulling the flapper off.
> 3. **Test the Flush**: After installation, give it a few test flushes to ensure the flapper stays in place.
> 
> If the problems persist after trying this, you might want to consider a full toilet rebuild kit, as it will replace other components that might be contributing to the issue.
