> I think I remember a story of the afterlife-- perhaps by a greek philosopher-- where people go to a place, get judged and sent into a big hole for 1000 years, and then return. Something like that. Does that ring a bell?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the story you're recalling is likely the "Myth of Er" from Plato's dialogue, "The Republic." Er was a Pamphylian soldier who was believed dead and placed on a funeral pyre, but revived and told a story about the afterlife.
> 
> In Er's tale, souls were judged and then sent for punishment or reward. Those that were judged guilty were sent to a place of punishment, a kind of 'underground cavern' where they would suffer for a period ten times the length of their crimes (this could easily be interpreted as your 1000 years). Equally, those who lived virtuously were rewarded for an equivalent time in 'heaven.'
> 
> After their sentence, the souls drink from the River Lethe ("river of forgetfulness") to forget their past lives and are reincarnated.
> 
> Thus, this myth emphasizes moral living in anticipation of the eternal rewards or punishment in the afterlife, and it serves as a philosophical tool for Plato to illustrate his ideas about soul, justice, and the purpose of human life.
