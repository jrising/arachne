> How can I get a hash string for a file in python, so that I can use it for caching and not process the same file twice? I want it to be based on the binary content of the file, not the filename (where there may be duplicates under different names).
**assistant**:
> To generate a hash string for the binary content of a file in Python, you can use the `hashlib` module with a hash function such as SHA256. Here's an example that computes the SHA256 hash for a file:
> 
> ```python
> import hashlib
> 
> def hash_file(filename):
>     h = hashlib.sha256()
> 
>     # Read the file in binary mode
>     with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
>         while chunk := file.read(4096): # Read in chunks to avoid using too much memory
>             h.update(chunk)
> 
>     return h.hexdigest()
> 
> # Usage:
> hash_value = hash_file('your_file_path_here')
> print(hash_value)
> ```
> 
> The `hash_file` function will return a hexadecimal string that represents the SHA256 hash of the file's content. If the content of two files are identical, they will have the same hash even if their names are different.
