**user**:
> If I know the probability of an event happening in each time period, what is the distribution of times between events?
**assistant**:
> If an event happens independently in each time period with a constant probability, then the time between events follows a geometric distribution. 
> 
> The geometric distribution models the number of trials that you need to get one success in Bernoulli trials. If the probability of success on each trial is p, then the probability that the k'th trial (first success) occurs on the n'th check is given by:
> 
> P(X=n) = (1-p)^(n-1) * p
> 
> Here, X is a random variable representing the number of trials up to and including the first success, and p is the probability of success on each trial. It's called a geometric distribution because when you plot its probabilities, they fall off in a geometric progression.
> 
> Please note that the geometric distribution counts the number of trials needed for the first success. If you're interested in the actual time between events, you need to account for the length of your time period.
**user**:
> What is the expected duration between events?
**assistant**:
> The expected duration between events in a geometric distribution is equal to the reciprocal of the probability of the event happening in each time period. 
> 
> In other words, if the probability of an event occurring in each time period is p, then the expected duration between events is given by:
> 
> Expected duration = 1 / p
> 
> For example, if the event occurs with a probability of 0.2 in each time period, the expected duration between events would be 1 / 0.2 = 5 time periods.
> 
> It's important to note that the expected duration is an average value and does not guarantee a specific outcome in any given sequence of events.
