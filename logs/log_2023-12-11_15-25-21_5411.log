**user**:
> In Julia, I want to access a column in a DataFrame where the underlying CSV has a period in the column. Will this show up as a period in the column name too?
**assistant**:
> Yes, if a column name in the CSV file has a period, it will appear the same way in the DataFrame when you load the CSV file in Julia.
> 
> However, based on Julia's syntax rules, you canâ€™t easily access a DataFrame column whose name contains a period (or any unsupported characters) using a dot (`.`) itself, like you can for DataFrame columns whose names are valid Julia identifiers (`df.column_name`). 
> 
> Instead, you access that column like you would access values in a dictionary, using square brackets and the column name as a string or symbol:
> 
> ```julia
> df["column.name"]
> # or
> df[:column_name]
> ```
> Here, `df` is the DataFrame and `"column.name"` or `:column.name` is the name of the column that contains a period.
> 
> The reason for this is that Julia, unlike some other languages, doesn't allow periods in variable names because it uses them for broadcasting functions over collections. The dot syntax (i.e., `df.column_name`) only works if `column_name` is a valid identifier, which a name with a period is not. 
> 
> You will need to use either the quoted string or symbol-syntax approach to access your columns. Note that you need the colon (:) before the column name only in the symbolic approach.
