**assistant**:
> To iterate through JSON objects stored in a JSONL (JSON Lines) file in Python, you can read the file line by line, parsing each line as a JSON object. Here's a simple example to demonstrate how you can do this using the `json` module:
> 
> ```python
> import json
> 
> # Replace 'your_file.jsonl' with the path to your JSONL file
> with open('your_file.jsonl', 'r') as file:
>     for line in file:
>         # Strip any whitespace (including newline characters) and parse the JSON object
>         json_object = json.loads(line.strip())
>         
>         # Process the json_object as needed
>         print(json_object)
> ```
> 
> This code snippet opens a JSONL file and iterates over each line. It uses `json.loads()` to parse each line as a JSON object, allowing you to work with the data in Python. Make sure your JSONL file is properly formatted, with each line containing a valid JSON object.
