**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon a report (Dewberry Engineers 2018) which has identified the following issues and data requirements for Offshore renewable energy siting and leasing:
> 
> Issues:
> • Understand the impacts to active use fishing areas from proposed energy projects
> • Minimize impacts to fishing activities
> • Document areas that are important to vessel
> transit through areas under consideration
> • Identify locations of geological hazards
> • Evaluate the impacts on habitats of renewable
> energy projects, oil/gas, pipelines, cables, and
> other infrastructure
> • Identify offshore wind and hydrokinetic
> resources
> 
> Data requirements
> • Jurisdictions and regulated areas
> • Abundance and distribution of marine species
> • Synthesized oceanographic parameters,
> including wind and wave resources
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel

> • Human and cultural use areas
> • Commercial fishing effort – Vessel Trip

**assistant**:
> Based on the report by Dewberry Engineers (2018), there are several key gaps that are pertinent to the spatial planning process in Delaware's ocean and bay. The focuses of these data gaps are related to offshore renewable energy siting and leasing, which have implications for various ocean activities, including commercial fishing, vessel transit, and marine habitats. 
> 
> In terms of issues, the report underscores the need for a better understanding and documentation of fishing areas potentially impacted by proposed energy projects. This is in order to minimize the adverse effects on fishing activities. The report also highlights the importance of documenting areas significant to vessel transit and identifying geological hazard locations. 
> 
> The data requirements specific to Delaware's ocean and bay outlined in the report emphasize the importance of obtaining more detailed information on the abundance and distribution of marine species, commercial fishing effort through the use of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), and the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) for vessel traffic. Furthermore, understanding the human and cultural use areas, species and habitat locations, and oil and gas infrastructure is also crucial for effective planning.
> 
> Delaware's ocean and bay planning process could therefore benefit from addressing these data gaps. Greater attention to these domains would contribute to more comprehensive planning and decision-making, thereby advancing sustainable practices in Delaware’s ocean and bay planning process.
