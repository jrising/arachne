**user**:
> My wife's employer provides a "Savings incentive match plan" (SIMPLE) IRA as their retirement plan. Does the pretax money that my wife contributes to the plan then deduct from the total that one can contribute to an IRA per year?
**assistant**:
> Yes, the contribution your wife makes to her SIMPLE IRA, which is pre-tax, does count towards the annual limit that one can contribute to an IRA. However, the contribution limits for SIMPLE IRAs are distinct and generally higher than those for traditional or Roth IRAs.
> 
> As of 2024, the contribution limit for SIMPLE IRAs is $13,500 per year for individuals under 50 and $16,500 for individuals aged 50 or over. This is in addition to any employer matching contributions. On the other hand, the contributions limits for traditional or Roth IRAs are $6,000 per year, or $7,000 if you're age 50 or older.
> 
> So, while there are limits to how much your wife can contribute pre-tax to her SIMPLE IRA, these will not typically impact the amount she can contribute to a separate traditional or Roth IRA, as long as she is within the respective limits for each type of account.
> 
> Keep in mind that income caps, tax deduction limits, and other rules may apply, so you might want to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to understand the best strategy for your situation.
