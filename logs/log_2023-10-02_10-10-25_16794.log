> Professor Katharina Billups
> Director, School of Marine Science and Policy
> College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment
> University of Delaware
> Lewes, Delaware 19958
> Dear Director Billups:
> By unanimous vote, we enthusiastically recommend Dr. James Rising be promoted to the
> position of Associate Professor with Tenure.
> The Promotion and Tenure (P&T) Committee of the School of Marine Science and
> Policy (SMSP) is charged with evaluating faculty candidates for promotion and tenure
> according to criteria established by the University of Delaware and the School. By policy,
> the Committee must critically review the evidentiary material submitted by the faculty
> member seeking promotion and tenure, solicit independent reviews of the candidate’s
> credentials from outside of the University, make a written recommendation that includes
> a numerical vote of the Committee, explain the reasons for the recommendation, and
> transmit the recommendation to the candidate and to the Director of SMSP in writing
> signed by all Committee members.
> In September 2023, the Committee, composed of Professors Tobias Kukulka (Chair),
> Jonathan Cohen, Jeremy Firestone, and Mark Moline, evaluated the promotion dossier of
> Assistant Professor James Rising, which followed guidelines of the University and
> School and addressed his activities in scholarship, teaching, and service. The Committee
> also considered external evaluations from six reviewers identified by the Committee and
> Dr. Rising, following university procedures (20 letters requested, seven received, with
> one received letter not considered because of a perceived conflict of interest by the
> Committee).
> This promotion evaluation considers: a) Dr. Rising’s scholarly contributions to the field;
> b) his advising and teaching; and c) his service to the School, College, University,
> Profession, and the broader community. Included and considered in this evaluation is his
> time at the University of Delaware as well as the three-year period of his tenure track
> position as an Assistant Professorial Research Professor at the London School of
> Economics (LSE). In this evaluation effort, we rely upon our own individual reviews of
> 
> Dr. Rising’s dossier, the written evaluations by the external reviewers, and the
> discussions about the candidate within the Committee.
> Based on our deliberations, our independent reviews of Dr. Rising’s dossier, and the
> judgments and opinions of external reviewers, we conclude that Dr. Rising has met or
> exceeded all criteria under evaluation. In brief, the Committee finds that Dr. Rising’s
> scholarly achievement, teaching, and service fully merit promotion to the rank of
> Associate Professor with Tenure in SMSP. Below we provide a summary of the
> evidence of Dr. Rising’s achievements on which we base our recommendation, supported
> by pertaining highlights from the external reviews.
> Scholarly Activities
> Dr. Rising’s research is highly interdisciplinary in nature and much of his work centers
> on the economic risks of climate variability and change, and the effects of uncertainty,
> the inequality of those effects and costs associated with adaptation. He uses historical
> data and develops statistical models to predict future societal impacts. Dr. Rising also
> integrates science and economic modeling approaches to evaluate the potential outcomes
> for environmental policy. The varying subjects of his research span from climate change,
> fisheries, land use change, human health, transportation, tipping points, and many more
> topics.
> All six external reviewers highlight that Dr. Rising’s contributions to the field are highly
> significant, with impacts nationally and internationally. Reviewers also highlight that Dr.
> Rising is a respected colleague, highly talented and is sought out as a collaborator. For
> example:
> “His work is at the frontier of climate impact research and simply brilliant.”
> [Reviewer 6]
> “Professor Rising is essentially unique. There are precious few people with
> Professor Rising’s array of skills and with an academic record this rich as an
> assistant professor.” [Reviewer 4]
> “... I can only judge him as an economist and he is so much more than that.”
> [Reviewer 1]
> “it was a direct input into the US government’s recent effort to comprehensively
> update it’s social cost of carbon, and was heavily cited in the supporting
> documentation for that effort. Put simply, this work is having enormous academic
> and policy impact.” [Reviewer 5]
> Dr. Rising’s efforts to support his research are solid with grants from diverse funding
> agencies, including international, national and regional support. Dr. Rising has been a PI
> or Co-PI on competitive grants totaling about $1.1M, including from the USGS, the
> European Climate Foundation, NIH, The Royal Society, Lavazza Foundation, the
> Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, and the City of
> Bethany Beach. He also has pending proposals with a total budget over $8M from a
> similar diversity of sources. Dr. Rising splits his responsibilities and both leads projects
> as well as contributes through effective collaboration. One External Reviewer concludes,
> 
> “The vita provides evidence of active grantsmanship at a scale appropriate for the
> candidate’s current seniority” [ Reviewer 4]
> Dr. Rising has the strongest publication record at this point in his career that any of the
> Committee members have reviewed. At UD and the LSE, he has published 21 papers in
> the peer-reviewed literature (26 total), seven of which as first author, another two were
> first-authored by his students, and one additional including students as co-authors.
> Additionally, he has led and contributed to a number of reports. These publications are in
> the community’s most prestigious and high-impact journals such as Nature (Impact
> Factor, IF=64.8), Science (IF=47.73), Nature Climate Change (IF=28.9), Quarterly
> Journal of Economics (IF=19.01), Nature Communications (IF=16.6), Proceedings of the
> National Academy of Science (IF=12.779), Global Environmental Change (IF=11.1),
> Scientific Data (IF=8.5), Environmental Research: Climate (IF=8.4), Environmental
> Research Letters (IF=6.9), and Ecological Economics (IF=6.78). Impressively, Dr.
> Rising bridges disciplinary gaps of natural science, sustainability, resource economics,
> and computer science. One of the External Reviewers [Reviewer 4] documents that
> citations of his work are evenly split between the U.S. and international institutions and
> papers citing his work appear in 400 different journals, highlighting the “huge potential
> audience” for his work. External reviewers highlight Dr. Rising’s superior research
> productivity with quotes like:
> “The work is of the highest quality, demonstrates significant technical ability and,
> maybe most importantly, is keenly policy relevant. ...This is simply put a superb
> record of research productivity.” [Reviewer 6]
> “Instead of just pointing out that these various risks are missing from existing
> analysis, the paper makes multiple useful diagnoses about why risks have not
> been incorporated to date, and useful prescriptions about how to fix the problem.”
> [Reviewer 5]
> “His 2021 annual median (of citation percentile) is in the 97th percentile, which is
> certainly very impressive.” [Reviewer 4]
> “Dr. Rising is an excellent researcher whose interdisciplinary work on the impacts
> of climate change has improved our understanding of climate damages and has
> helped to inform policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.” [Reviewer 3]
> “I would even go so far as to say that his record compares with that of
> [MacArthur Fellow] David Lobell.” [Reviewer 2]
> “Prof. Rising’s affiliation with the Climate Impacts Lab at the University of
> Chicago has resulted in several highly visible many-author publications.”
> [Reviewer 1]
> These comments attest to Dr. Rising’s high level of research productivity. Therefore, the
> committee concludes that Dr. Rising has established himself as a highly-respected
> researcher at the nexus of environmental and human systems. He clearly exceeds the
> scholarly requirements for promotion to the rank of Associate Professor with Tenure.
> 
> Teaching and Advisement
> Dr. Rising’s formal classroom teaching includes three different courses in his area of
> expertise and two seminars, contributing to the School's graduate as well as
> undergraduate teaching missions. At the graduate level, he has taught Complex Systems
> Analysis (MAST 467/667, 3 cr.), Climate Change Economics (MAST 488/688, 3 cr.),
> and Climate Change: Science, Economics, and Policy (GY427 - LSE), and two seminars.
> Three of these courses (MAST 467/667, MAST 488/688, and the Philosophy of Research
> seminar) were newly developed by Dr. Rising at UD. The courses also include
> undergraduates, which can be a challenge from a pedagogical perspective, however Dr.
> Rising has navigated this well with a philosophy of student-directed and project-based
> learning. His courses range from 8 and 99 students. Dr. Rising’s course reviews ranged
> from good to excellent and his instructor scores were very good to excellent. Student
> comments include: Professor Rising is “excellent and he provides very good examples,
> he is very clear when speaking, which is very helpful for nonnative speakers.” (GY427),
> “Patience; Accuracy of content; Good pacing; Quality materials; Content rich in figures;
> Availability to assist students; Knowledge of the topics; Enthusiasm for the topics;
> Hybrid class; Practical labs ...to only name a few...” (MAST 467/667), “This course was
> among the most inspiring, informative, and practically-helpful that I've taken in my
> nearly 10-year academic career so far.” (MAST 467/667), and “Engaged, provided
> helpful feedback, made extra effort to find talks we would be interested in” (MAST 873).
> External Reviewers commented on Dr. Rising courses and his teaching experience:
> “...he has developed and taught a number of extremely interesting courses and
> takes “good interdisciplinarity” seriously.” [Reviewer 6]
> “...extensive teaching experience across a wide range of topics over the last
> twenty years...” [Reviewer 4]
> Dr. Rising also revised the policy portion of the required Coupling Natural and Human
> Systems (MAST 610) course, which he is offering this fall, to supplement his regular
> offerings of Climate Change Economics and Complex Systems Analysis. Additionally,
> he has been instrumental in developing two new degrees in SMSP; Master’s and PhD’s in
> Environmental Economics and a new professional Master’s degree in Environmental
> Science and Management at the College-level. This effort, in concert with five other
> faculty in the Marine Policy group in SMSP, developed these new curricula designed to
> address current and anticipated changes and demands in those disciplinary areas. His
> Coupled Systems and Climate Change Economics courses will be part of these degrees
> and will likely grow in student numbers as the programs are fully implemented in the
> coming years.
> Dr. Rising is currently advising three PhD students and two Master students all at UD,
> and has graduated one PhD student and five Master students at LSE. He has also served
> on 4 PhD committees. These students include a diverse group from a number of different
> countries. He has also mentored one post-doctoral scholar in his group. Past students
> have won awards and have gone on to have successful careers in finance, consulting, and
> academia, which speaks to Dr. Rising’s mentorship of and professional skill building in
> his students.
> 
> The Committee concludes that Dr. Rising has met the teaching requirements for
> promotion to the rank of Associate Professor with Tenure.
> Service
> Dr. Rising has an impressive record of service to the School, College, University and his
> 
> profession. He has been an active member of the SMSP Graduate Committee and co-
> organized the SMSP Colloquium series. Similarly at LSE, Dr. Rising co-organized the
> 
> Climate Change and Environment Research Seminar Series, the Grantham Research
> Institute Public Event Committee and was the Net-Zero Grantham Research Institute
> Coordinator. Dr. Rising is dedicated to promoting cultural and racial diversity, gender
> equality, and supporting a broad range of backgrounds among our academic community
> this has been evident in his seminar speaker guests as well as his active participation in
> Unlearning Racism in Geoscience (URGE) where he helped to translate discussions into
> concrete actions in SMSP’s hiring, student resources available, and interactions with the
> University. Dr. Rising also is an active participant as an affiliated faculty member in
> UD’s Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence and the Data Science Institute.
> Dr. Rising is also making contributions to the community through building "open
> models", tools that lower the barriers to researchers contributing to the advancement of
> science. Examples of this include the Distributed Meta-Analysis System (DMAS),
> allowing people to contribute results and perform meta-analyses dynamically; his work
> on the Mimi project, which allows components from different integrated natural-social
> models to be shared (he used this to open-source the PAGE model and build the META
> and AWASH models); and his work on "agglomerated modeling", which allows multiple
> models to be coupled while changing the way we think about problems of scale and
> input-output relationships. These modeling approaches that Dr. Rising is developing for
> the community will likely become an integral part of the future for many fields.
> Dr. Rising has contributed to a significant number of paper reviews in top rated journals,
> co-chaired a number of sessions at the American Geophysical Union meetings, as well as
> co-organized a number of workshops through his involvement at the Climate Impact Lab,
> and participated in public outreach through talks (e.g. Rotary Club) and media
> publications (e.g. Forbes). He is also actively involved as an affiliated faculty or scholar
> in a number of national and international centers/institutes; Columbia University Water
> Center, Climate Impact Lab, Center for Environmental Economics and Policy, MIT Joint
> Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, International Center of Excellence,
> and Grantham Research Institute.
> External reviewers are equally impressed with his service commitment:
> “It [Dr. Rising’s risk assessment work] has been used by the EPA in calculating
> the Social Cost of Carbon just proposed by the Biden Administration. Amazing.
> ...he provides service to the profession far in excess of what is expected from an
> assistant professor. An example of this is the amazing workshop he organized
> with Sir Nicolas Stern at the Royal Academy of Sciences last year.” [Reviewer 6]
> 
> “To the extent that Professor Rising’s research has influenced the citing authors’
> thinking, it has indirectly influenced the pending policy decisions that the funding
> agency has sought to support through its research-related expenditures.”
> [Reviewer 4]
> “I have never seen such an exemplary documentation of all of his current
> professional contributions to the broad scientific community within which he
> works, his planned future contributions to that community, and his loyalty to your
> programs.” [Reviewer 2]
> The committee thanks Dr. Rising for outstanding service contributions to his profession,
> the University, College and School, as well as the public and concludes that Dr. Rising
> has exceeded the service requirements for promotion to the rank of Associate Professor
> with Tenure.
> Summary
> In closing, the SMSP P&T committee enthusiastically recommends Dr. Rising’s
> promotion to Associate Professor with Tenure. Our recommendation is based on our
> own reading of his record and on the uniformly positive comments of the external
> reviewers. All six external reviewers are unanimous in their support of promotion to
> Associate Professor with Tenure. A few excerpts are below:
> “Prof. Rising exceeds the standards we apply for promotion to tenure and I fully
> support his promotion without reservations.” [Reviewer 6]
> “I think you have a promising colleague and I look forward to following his
> career in the future.” [ Reviewer 1]
> “I strongly urge you to promote him.” [Reviewer 3]
> “...you have a global treasure in your midst. He is a shining and rising star in the
> constellation of the new generation of interdisciplinary scholars working to
> advance the boundaries of our international knowledge about climate change and
> the risks that it poses for all of humanity.” [Reviewer 2]
> “I think Dr Rising very clearly meets your stated criteria for tenure.” [Reviewer 5]
> “Professor Rising’s extensive academic investments mean he is now twenty years
> past his undergraduate degree, with a variety of affiliations, publications,
> citations, and grants that make him look a lot more like a candidate for promotion
> to Full Professor than merely a candidate for tenure. I’m glad to see that Delaware
> has not waited longer...” [Reviewer 4]
> In the Committee’s evaluation of the materials provided by Dr. Rising, he has met or
> exceeded all criteria for promotion and demonstrates a trajectory for continued growth
> and significant impact in research, teaching, and professional service. We congratulate
> Dr. Rising on his excellent achievements.
