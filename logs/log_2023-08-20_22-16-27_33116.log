> Can I quickly in javascript find out how much two strings share at their starts? That is, I basically want to find out, for strings A and B, a number N, where the first N characters of A and B are the same.
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can easily accomplish this in JavaScript by comparing each character of both strings from the start concurrently. Here's a simple function that would accomplish this:
> 
> ```javascript
> function sharedStartLength(s1, s2) {
>   let i = 0;
>   while (i < s1.length && i < s2.length && s1[i] === s2[i]) i++;
>   return i;
> }
> 
> let string1 = "JavaScript";
> let string2 = "Java";
> 
> console.log(sharedStartLength(string1, string2));  // Output: 4
> ```
> 
> This function loops over each character in both strings. If the characters at the current index match, it increments a counter. When it finds a pair of characters that do not match, or it reaches the end of one of the strings, it returns the current count, which represents the length of the shared starting substring.

> How do I take the first N characters as a substring in javascript?
**assistant**:
> In JavaScript, you can use the `substring()` method to extract a substring with a specified length from a string. The `substring()` method takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index (optional). If you only provide one argument, it will return the substring starting from the specified index to the end of the string.
> 
> Here's an example that demonstrates how to extract the first `N` characters as a substring:
> 
> ```javascript
> let string = "Hello, world!";
> let length = 5;
> let substring = string.substring(0, length);
> 
> console.log(substring);  // Output: Hello
> ```
> 
> In the code above, the `substring` variable will store the first `N` characters (where `N` is the `length` variable) of the `string` variable.
> 
> Note that the `substring()` method is zero-based, meaning the first character of the string has an index of `0`.
