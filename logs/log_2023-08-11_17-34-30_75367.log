> 1. Common Loon (Gavia Immer)
> 
> Description: A migratory bird that thrives in marine environments in winter and spring.
> Current Status: Protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA).
> Spatial Extent: Throughout North America; overwinters along North American coasts.
> Temporal Pattern: Strong spring and fall presence; moderate in winter; little to no summer presence.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Unknown specifics.
> Stakeholders: Environmental agencies, local communities, scientists.
> Sources: The report cites Evers, Paruk, McIntyre, & Barr, 2010; O’Connell et al., 2009.
> Any Other Notes: N/A
> 2. Great Shearwater (Puffinus Gravis)
> 
> Description: A highly migratory bird species having a significant presence during summer and fall.
> Current Status: Protected by the MBTA; identified as a species in need of conservation due to population declines and threats to breeding grounds.
> Spatial Extent: Global; Atlantic Coast migration.
> Temporal Pattern: Very strong in summer and fall; little to no presence in winter and spring.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Unknown specifics.
> Stakeholders: Environmental agencies, local communities, scientists.
> Sources: The report cites USGS, 2010a; O’Connell et al., 2009.
> Any Other Notes: N/A
> 3. Audubon’s Shearwater (Puffinus Lherminieri)
> 
> Description: Likely to manifest in summer and fall, with little to no presence observed in winter and spring.
> Current Status: Protected by the MBTA; needs conservation due to population decline and threats to its breeding grounds.
> Spatial Extent: Dominantly along the Atlantic Coast in the summer and fall.
> Temporal Pattern: Prevalent in summer and fall; little or no presence in winter and spring.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Unknown specifics.
> Stakeholders: Environmentalists, scientists, local communities.
> Sources: The report cites USGS, 2010b; O’Connell et al., 2009.
