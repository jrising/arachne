> Micro level effects: Capital destruction involves damage to assets arising from physical shocks and hazards such as flooding or landslides. Stranded assets refer to new regulations or changing consumer preferences resulting in premature write-offs of assets, for instance, because a factory is located in an area that becomes designated as protected. Price volatility of raw materials involves higher or more volatile prices of commodities due to, for instance, failed harvests of food crops. Disruptions in production processes and value chains lead to increased costs as a result of temporary disruptions to business or household processes, such as a suspension of services due to flooding. Relocation and adjustment of economic activities may account for a reduction or loss of ecosystem services or aim to reduce negative impacts, such as planting different crops on a farm. Pricing of externalities involves cost increases due to pricing in negative (or positive) impacts on nature, for instance, a tax on certain pollutants.
> 
> Macro level effects: Prices change for commodities, energy, or water, potentially creating inflationary pressure. Productivity effects on GDP may result from a diversion of investment, lower risk appetites for innovation, reduced labor productivity, the loss of provisioning or regulating service productivity, or damage and disruptions to assets. Higher investment needs for mitigation or adaptation can lead to accelerated depreciation of the current capital base. Socio-economic changes include effects from structural changes to the economic system, changing societal preferences, arising inequalities, migration, or conflict. Changes to trade and capital flows may result from shocks in ecosystem service provision, potentially affecting exchange rates and sovereign credit ratings. Fiscal balances may be affected by an increased need in social protection spending, reduced fiscal revenues due to losses in production, and employment.

> The micro and macro level effects are interconnected. Microeconomic effects can influence macroeconomic effects, which in turn can affect households and businesses, potentially creating feedback loops. Introducing sectoral or regional level effects in the analysis may better capture these dynamics.
> 
> Substitutability: Actors react differently to shocks depending on their sensitivity to the shock and their ability to adapt. The concept of substitutability is relevant, with two dimensions being geographical substitution and technological substitution. Geographical substitution involves moving operations or altering production processes, while technological substitution may involve changing suppliers or products. Jurisdictions or businesses with higher reliance on primary sectors could be more exposed to economic effects, and large-scale global ecosystem degradation could make it harder to find alternative sources of required ecosystem services.
