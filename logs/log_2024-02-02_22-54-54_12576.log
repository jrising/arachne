**user**:
> In jquery, how can I iterate over children of an item I have in a variable, like $ul.
**assistant**:
> You can iterate over children of a jQuery object using the `.children()` method and the `.each()` method together. 
> 
> Here's an example using `$ul` as your jQuery object:
> 
> ```javascript
> $ul.children().each(function() {
>     // 'this' here refers to each child element
>     var $child = $(this); // wrapping 'this' in jQuery, if you need to use jQuery methods
> 
>     console.log($child); // Logging into console. Replace with your own logic.
> });
> ```
> 
> In this code, `.children()` gets all immediate child elements of `$ul`, and `.each()` is a jQuery method that iterates over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. The `this` keyword inside the function refers to the current child element in the iteration.
> 
> If you want to target specific child elements, you can provide a selector to the `.children()` method. For example, `$ul.children('li')` would select only the `<li>` child elements of `$ul`.
