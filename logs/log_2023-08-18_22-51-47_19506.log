> Delaware marine waters are a remarkable and diverse habitat, playing host to numerous critical species. They encompass the critical habitat of the Atlantic Sturgeon and provide a biologically important area for the North Atlantic Right Whale as designated. These waters have also been deemed a Habitat Area of Particular Concern for a trio of shark species; the Sand Tiger Shark, the Sandbar Shark, and the Summer Flounder. This extends to include the intersection with two specified areas under Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2, namely Toms, Middle Toms & Hendrickson Canyons and Wilmington Canyon (New England). Furthermore, they serve as essential habitats for a breadth of highly migratory fish species, including Albacore Tuna, Bigeye Tuna, Bluefin Tuna, Blue Marlin, Roundscale Spearfish, Skipjack Tuna, Longbill Spearfish, Swordfish, White Marlin, and Yellowfin Tuna. An additional section of the marine waters accommodates essential habitats for a multitude of migratory shark species as well, encompassing the Atlantic Angel Shark, Blue Shark, Basking Shark, Bigeye Thresher Shark, Night Shark, Common Thresher Shark, Dusky Shark, Silky Shark, Longfin Mako Shark, Sandbar Shark, Shortfin Mako Shark, Tiger Shark, the Smoothhound Shark Complex (Atlantic Stock), Atlantic Sharpnose Shark (Atlantic Stock), and, once more, the Sand Tiger Shark. Surely, the vast richness of life in Delaware's marine waters underscores the vital importance of careful planning and robust conservation strategies.
