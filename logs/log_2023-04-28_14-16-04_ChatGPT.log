> Certainly! Here's a list of readings that should help synthesize discussions on society, ethics, empiricism, and methods, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of good research in the context of the Philosophy of Research:

> 
> 9. McIntyre, L. (2019). "The Scientific Attitude: Defending Science from Denial, Fraud, and Pseudoscience". MIT Press.

> These readings provide a range of perspectives on the philosophy of research, addressing the nature of scientific inquiry, the role of values and ethics, and the importance of diversity and inclusivity in knowledge production. They should offer a solid foundation for wrapping up your course and fostering rich discussions on good research practices.
