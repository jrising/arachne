**assistant**:
> The term you're looking for is **meteorological drought indices**. These indices are based solely on weather variables such as precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration (ET). An example is the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which integrates temperature and precipitation data to infer drought conditions without directly considering human water usage.
