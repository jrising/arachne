> The first page of the report titled "The Cost of Inaction: A CEO Guide to Navigating Climate Risk," prepared in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group, sets the stage for the December 2024 Annual Report. It introduces the theme of the report, emphasizing the importance of addressing climate risks. The page features a dramatic image depicting a city skyline under a stormy sky, highlighted by a striking lightning bolt. This visual metaphor underscores the urgent and powerful impact of climate change on urban environments, setting a serious tone for the discussions within the report.

> The executive summary highlights the critical need for companies to address climate inaction, which poses significant physical and transition risks. It warns of potential future economic costs if businesses remain unprepared while emphasizing the benefits of adaptation and mitigation investments, potentially repaying five to six times their cost. Companies must integrate climate risks into their strategies to maintain resilience, manage risks, and seize opportunities. It calls for scenario planning for varying climate futures, aligning capital allocation with climate strategies, and embedding climate risk management into daily operations. Early action can protect businesses from high costs and valuation impacts due to transition risks.

> Page 4 discusses the severe economic impacts of climate inaction, highlighting that climate change has already caused over $3.6 trillion in damage since 2000. It warns that without urgent action, the global GDP could decrease by up to 22% cumulatively by 2100. An accompanying image illustrates extensive destruction, depicting a collapsed building with scattered debris and household items, implying the aftermath of a natural disaster.

Figure 1 illustrates the rising trend of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over millennia, noting a sharp increase since the industrial revolution, with June 2024 levels at 427 ppm. Figure 2 demonstrates global warming, showing that the global average land-sea temperature anomaly has reached +1.2 degrees Celsius in 2024, based on a 1961-1990 average baseline. These visuals highlight the accelerating pace of climate change and its tangible impacts.

> Page 7 illustrates various Earth systems and their potential tipping points as a function of temperature increase, highlighting the risk of irreversible decline and impact on global warming. It focuses on five key systems at immediate risk, including the Greenland ice sheet, boreal forests, the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, the Amazon rainforest, and West Antarctic ice sheet. The page also examines how emissions over the next 30 years will affect temperatures over the next 10,000 years, emphasizing the long-term impact of present-day emissions under different climate scenarios. Figures are sourced from the Global Tipping Points Report and research by Clark et al. 2023.

> Page 9 discusses the intensifying impacts of climate change, noting that carbon dioxide levels in summer 2024 reached their highest in 3 million years. Human-induced climate change has led to about 2,300 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions since industrialization began, resulting in a 1.2°C global temperature rise. The frequency of natural disasters has increased five-fold over the past 50 years. While individual events are hard to attribute solely to climate change, human activity is a significant factor. The page highlights the broader socio-political threats posed by these adverse climatic changes, emphasizing their potential to destabilize societies and complicate global issues.

> Page 10 underscores the escalating economic burdens posed by climate change, focusing on insurance implications and infrastructure damage. It highlights that climate disasters have led to a sharp rise in insurance premiums, with the potential for significant areas to become uninsurable, especially as companies reassess risk exposure in vulnerable regions. The page also warns about the increasing cost of rebuilding and restoring damaged infrastructure, as well as the compounding effects of frequent extreme weather events, which amplify economic pressure on national and local economies.

It details how climate change can slow down GDP growth by reducing productivity, agricultural yields, and causing infrastructure damage. The page warns that delaying emissions reductions will have severe long-term economic impacts and highlights that while climate risks are often seen as compliance issues, leading businesses address these from a financial perspective to support strategy and management decisions.

> Climate inaction would cost far more than climate action globally. Investing around three percent of cumulative GDP into mitigation and adaptation saves ten to fifteen percent in net GDP loss. Mitigation investments are less than two percent, while adaptation investments are less than one percent. These investments are required to achieve a "below two degrees Celsius" scenario compared to a business-as-usual, three degrees Celsius pathway.

> Businesses will need to carefully navigate risks associated with climate change. The following chapters of this report analyze both physical and transition risks to businesses, as well as the opportunities that adaptation to climate change can bring.
> 
> Chapter two discusses physical risks, which are becoming more significant and contribute to lower revenues due to supply chain disruptions and higher operational and capital expenses from structural damage. 
> 
> Chapter three outlines transition risks that reshape industries, driven by factors such as changing regulations, asset write-downs, and shifting customer and investor perceptions. 
> 
> Corporate costs of global inaction include physical risks, which may lead to lower revenue from downtime, productivity loss, and supply chain disruptions. Higher capital expenditures may occur due to restoration of structural damage to facilities, along with higher operational expenses from increasing input prices and insurance premiums.
> 
> Corporate costs of their own inaction involve transition risks, including higher operational expenses due to changing input prices and new regulations, as well as value adjustments on investments that are terminated prematurely. There may be lower revenue from a declining demand on outdated assets and decreased capitalization from shifts in investor perceptions. 
> 
> On the other hand, there are new opportunities for businesses, such as developing new products and services, accessing new markets, and improving resilience through enhanced resource efficiency and more affordable energy sources. Businesses may experience higher revenue and margins from the commercialization of new offers and preserved assets from proper adaptation and conscious investment decisions.
> 
> Additionally, companies can reduce operational expenses through energy and resource efficiency, achieve lower costs of capital, and gain easier hiring and retention processes (TCFD 2024).
