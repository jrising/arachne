> Page 9 discusses the intensifying impacts of climate change, noting that carbon dioxide levels in summer 2024 reached their highest in 3 million years. Human-induced climate change has led to about 2,300 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions since industrialization began, resulting in a 1.2°C global temperature rise. The frequency of natural disasters has increased five-fold over the past 50 years. While individual events are hard to attribute solely to climate change, human activity is a significant factor. The page highlights the broader socio-political threats posed by these adverse climatic changes, emphasizing their potential to destabilize societies and complicate global issues.

> Page 16 discusses the economic impacts of climate risks on companies within the next two decades. It highlights that in a scenario of unchecked climate change (exceeding 3°C), companies across various sectors and regions could face an additional 5-25% of their EBITDA at risk by 2050. The page presents data on the average financial impact of these physical risks by 2050 for different sectors and regions. In contrast, under a Paris-aligned scenario (less than 2°C increase), the financial risks could be significantly lower. It emphasizes the need for action to mitigate these risks and presents detailed sector-based financial impact estimates. An accompanying image depicts a rural cornfield under a golden sunset, reinforcing the theme of natural climate-related challenges.

> Page 17 discusses the underestimation of physical risks stemming from climate change among businesses. Companies recognize these risks but struggle to assess their full financial impact, often due to fragmented and inconsistent data. The Climate Disclosure Project's 2023 data reveals that a significant portion of large companies acknowledge climate risks. However, most fail to incorporate these risks effectively into their planning. They frequently identify only immediate risks in isolation, resulting in lower reported financial exposure than more comprehensive analyses suggest. The page emphasizes that this limited approach is inadequate, particularly as global inaction heightens diverse climate threats.
