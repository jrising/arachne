> Cross-boundary flows of fish spawn can form a significant contribution of eventual fishery catch. Climate change may disrupt these flows in the future through multiple channels: changing spawning suitability, shifting cross-boundary currents, accelerated spawn development, and changes in settlement likelihood. These biophysical impacts, in turn, can result in conflict due to nation-based fisheries management, and reduced stocks can result in unintentional mismanagement. We evaluate the risks to fisheries posed by each of these channels of climate risks. To do so, we combine a Lagrangian modelling scheme to study the dispersal of spawn with extensive fisheries data covering over 2000 commercially fished species. We model changes in suitability based on monthly varying suitability envelops that account for sea temperatures, primary productivity, and sea-ice. We have geo-coded thousands of spawning regions, many to the grid-cell level, to better understand cross-boundary spawn flows. Temperature-depending larval development and adult movement models are based on newly developed empirical relationships. Changes in fecundity and life-stage suitability driven by climate change are drawn from the literature. Finally, we use this model of climate change and cross-boundary risks to quantify projected changes in country-level fisheries catch and economic value, identifying the drivers behind winners and losers.

> The plain-language summary is based off and in addition to the scientific abstract and aims to help the general reader understand the summary of your abstract.
> 
> The plain-language summary will be published with your abstract if accepted in the meeting scientific program. The plain-language summary should be written for a broad audience. It should be free of jargon, acronyms, equations and any technical information that would be unknown to the general public. The purpose is to explain the study to the public. A good summary should state the general problem, what was done, and the result.

> Fish make a significant part of what we catch and eat from the oceans. But, the climate crisis is wreaking havoc on these fish populations because it affects how young fish—called spawn—move and grow. This study focuses on some of the ways spawn will experience the effects of the climate crisis. There are important influences like: how suitable the ocean is for fish to lay eggs, how currents which carry the spawn across country boundaries are shifting, how the warming oceans are making spawn grow up quicker, and how a change in where they end up influences their chance of surviving into adulthood. These changes can lead to conflicts between countries over fishing rights, and can also lead to accidental overfishing when there are less fish than we assume there are.

> Researchers used a complex computer model to examine how spawn dispersal evolves and how it might influence commercial fisheries for over 2000 types of fish. They took into account lots of details—like the temperature, the quantity of food available for fish in different places and at different times, the presence of sea-ice, and even the specific locations where fish lay eggs. This means the model gives a really detailed picture of what might happen to fish populations as the climate crisis worsens.

> Using this model, researchers predicted changes in how much fish each country might catch, and what it could mean for the economy. This information is really important as it helps us understand who might be most affected by these changes. Simply put, this study helps us understand better who would win and who would lose if climate change alters the way fish spawn move and grow in the world's oceans.

> I like the first part. The second and third paragraphs which refers to "Researchers" and terms like "really important" seems overly journalistic. Can you simplify this part?
**assistant**:
> Sure! Here's a simplified version of the second and third paragraphs:
> 
> "To study the effects of the climate crisis on fish populations, scientists used a computer model. They looked at various factors like temperature, food availability, and where fish lay eggs to understand how spawn dispersal might change. With this detailed model, they made predictions about how much fish each country could catch and what it would mean for their economies. This information helps us see who might be impacted the most if the climate crisis continues to affect the movement and growth of fish in the oceans."
