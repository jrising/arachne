**user**:
> I am trying to get access to an old MediaWiki installation that I have just upgraded. I can see the pages, but I cannot reset my password. I suspect that something has gone wrong with the email sending system. But I can access the database. How can I replace my password in the database?
**assistant**:
> Sure, you can directly modify the user_password field in your MediaWiki database. However, the password there is encrypted, so you can't simply insert a plaintext password. Instead, you can use a maintenance script provided by MediaWiki to generate the encrypted version of the password. Here's how you could do it:
> 
> **Step 1:** First, you ensure that you've backed up your database. Changing the database directly can have unexpected results if not done correctly.
> 
> **Step 2:** You can generate a new, hashed password using MediaWiki's `changePassword.php` maintenance script. This script should be located in the `maintenance` directory where MediaWiki is installed. 
> 
> If you have command-line access on the server and can run PHP scripts, you can generate a new password like so:
> 
> ```bash
> php changePassword.php --user=<username> --password=<new password>
> ```
> 
> Replace `<username>` with your username and `<new password>` with the desired new password.
> 
> **Step 3:** If you're unable to execute the `changePassword.php` script for some reason, you can alternatively use a Python script to generate a compatible password hash.  
> 
> This Python script creates a B-type MediaWiki password hash:  
> 
> ```python
> import hashlib
> import random
> import string
> 
> # Generate a random salt
> salt = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits) for i in range(8))
> 
> password = 'your new password'
> 
> # Generate a 'B' type salted password hash (B-type is the most common password hash type used in MediaWiki)
> hashed_password = ':B:' + salt + ':' + hashlib.md5((salt + '-' + hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()).encode()).hexdigest()
> 
> print(hashed_password)
> ```
> 
> **Step 4:** Use the hashed password obtained from the above step to replace the password in your database. You should be able to execute the SQL command:
> 
> ```SQL
> UPDATE `user`
> SET user_password = "<insert hashed password from step 3>"
> WHERE user_name = "<your username>";
> ```
> 
> Please replace `"your username"` and `"insert hashed password from step 3"` with your MediaWiki username and the hash generated by the Python script, respectively.
> 
> **Step 5:** Now, when you log in to your MediaWiki installation, use the plaintext version of the password you created. MediaWiki will hash it in the same way as the Python script did, and it should match the hash in the database. 
> 
> Please remember that directly modifying the database should always be the last resort, and it should not be performed without a proper backup.
> 
> If this above method does not work or if you're uncomfortable performing these steps, you may want to consider hiring a professional to assist you further.
