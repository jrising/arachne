**assistant**:
> Yes, you can include multiple commands on a single line in R by separating them with a semicolon (`;`). For example:
> 
> ```r
> x <- 5; y <- x^2; print(y)
> ```
> 
> This code assigns the value 5 to `x`, computes `y` as the square of `x`, and prints `y`, all on a single line. However, for readability, it's often better to separate commands onto different lines unless concise code is specifically needed.
