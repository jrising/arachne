> Dealing with long-tailed distributions can indeed be challenging when the mean becomes difficult to interpret. Trimming the tails is a common technique, especially to make the data more manageable and to derive more meaningful statistics.

> 1. **Quantile-based trimming:** You've already examined various quantiles, which is great. Trimming at, for example, the 1% and 99% quantiles is common practice. This eliminates the most extreme outliers while preserving the bulk of the data.
> 
> 2. **Consider the context:** The decision should factor in the substantive context of the analysis. If extreme values are theoretically less important for your specific analysis or policy implications, you might justify more aggressive trimming.
> 
> 3. **Sensitivity analysis:** After choosing a trimming point, conduct a sensitivity analysis to see how changes in the trimming level affect your results. This helps in understanding the robustness of the conclusions to these methodological choices.
> 
> 4. **Consult literature:** Since other papers in your field also trim tails, examine their approaches to justify a comparable method, keeping your analysis consistent with established practice.
> 
> Considering your specific data, trimming at 1% and 99% might be a sensible initial choice. It captures almost the entire range, excluding only the extremities. This decision could make your statistics more interpretable without discarding too much meaningful information.
