> Good morning Dr. Rising, 
> 
> My name is Autumn Bland, I am currently a Master of Environmental Studies Candidate at the University of Waterloo (Canada), in Sustainability Management and the Water Institute. My thesis focuses on how personality psychology is interconnected with water conservation. I graduated from Michigan State University in May 2022 with a BA in Psychology, a minor in Cognitive Science and completed 8 additional classes in Political Science Pre-Law. 
> 
> I am extremely interested in continuing my education at the PhD level with regard to water governance and conservation. Specifically, with how incentive programs and collaboration with communities can influence climate and water related policies. I have recently returned from a Vulnerability to Viability global conference and field school at the Chilika Lagoon in Odisha, India where we had a first-hand experience in small scale fisheries and water vulnerability. This field school gave me the opportunity to directly view water value and related issues from the lens of the global south, and communities who are trying to transition towards viability. I have been placed in a research group where we are currently working on publishing a manuscript "Justice and Equity" for the small scale fishing communities in the Chilika Lagoon. 
> 
> Through my research, I have found that the University of Delaware - School of Marine Science and Policy PhD is an area that appeals to my expertise, interests and is an area I believe I could be extremely of passion towards that directly overlaps towards my academic goals. 
> 
> Thank you so much for taking the time to read this email. I have also attached a copy of my resume. 
> 
> I look forward to hearing back from you.

> From Autumn's email, it seems that she is interested in the Ph.D. program in Marine Policy at the University of Delaware. Her focus on water governance and conservation policy appears to align well with the core themes of the program. Further, her experience in working with communities and enthusiasm to learn about water-related issues in the global south give her a unique perspective that could integrate well with the goals of the program.
> 
> She is also showing an interest in a component of my research - climate policy, so she could potentially be an asset in advancing my research.
> 
> Autumn does not appear to be local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, as she is currently studying in Canada and has completed her previous education at Michigan State University. However, she has not mentioned whether she has done work or been involved with MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or the University of Delaware.

> Based on this information, I would suggest following the template and crafting the response as such:
> 
> Dear Autumn,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your focus on water governance and conservation, as well as your experience with diverse communities, resonate with the multidisciplinary realm of our Ph.D. program in Marine Policy. It is indeed an area where your passion and academic goals can find fertile ground.
> 
> However, funding can be a challenge in our program. I would encourage you to apply by the end of the calendar year for thorough consideration.
> 
> Your interest in climate policy aligns with my research, so feel free to mention my name in your statement of purpose. This would serve as a solid linkage between your research aspiration and our faculty interest.
