**assistant**:
> Advisory boards and giving boards (or fiduciary boards) have different expectations and responsibilities. Here's a brief comparison:
> 
> **Advisory Board:**
> 
> Advisory board members are typically sought for their industry expertise, network, strategic vision, or credentials, which can add legitimacy and prestige to an organization. The expectations include:
> 
> 1. Providing non-binding strategic advice and guidance to the management or executive board, based on their knowledge and experience.
> 2. Broadening the organization's network and opening doors, possibly helping to identify potential partnerships.
> 3. Possibly acting as an advocate or ambassador for the organization.
> 4. Meeting periodically and providing consultation on specific issues, as needed.
> 
> However, advisory board members do not have a legal responsibility or authority to govern the organization—that is the role of the board of directors.
> 
> **Giving Board (Fiduciary Board):**
> 
> A giving board, also known as a fiduciary board, has legal and ethical duties to the organization. This includes:
> 
> 1. Setting the strategic direction of the organization.
> 2. Hiring, firing, and establishing compensation for the CEO or executive director.
> 3. Ensuring the organization's financial health, often including a requirement that board members make (or "give") significant financial contributions themselves, and help raise additional funds.
> 4. Establishing major company policies, ensuring the organization meets legal and ethical standards.
> 5. Reviewing and approving the organization's budget.
> 6. Protecting and ensuring the use of assets for the organization’s mission.
> 
> Remember that specific expectations can vary based on the organization's bylaws and the terms of board membership. Always review these before joining a board to ensure you understand the responsibilities and commitments involved.
