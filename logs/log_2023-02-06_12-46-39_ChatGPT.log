> I would suggest assigning the first chapter of "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas S. Kuhn, titled "The Route to Normal Science." This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of Kuhn's central concept of "normal science," which refers to the day-to-day work of scientists within a dominant paradigm. It is a crucial chapter that sets the stage for the rest of the book and explains the importance of paradigm shifts in scientific revolutions. Additionally, it provides a good introduction to the broader philosophical implications of Kuhn's ideas for understanding scientific progress.
