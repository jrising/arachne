**user**:
> What funding bodies/opportunities would a faculty member in Offshore Energy (critical minerals, carbon capture with enhanced ocean sequestration, offshore wind, marine spatial planning, and energy law) be positioned to pursue? We thought of the Department of Energy, but surely there are more.
**assistant**:
> Indeed, multiple funding opportunities may be available for a faculty member in Offshore Energy, particularly relevant to the subjects of critical minerals, carbon capture with enhanced ocean sequestration, offshore wind, marine spatial planning, and energy law. Below are some potential funding bodies and opportunities:
> 
> 1. **Department of Energy (DOE)**: The DOE has multiple offices that could potentially extend funding. Their Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) often has funding opportunities for renewable energy projects, including offshore wind. The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management may also be relevant for carbon capture, storage, and sequestration technologies.
> 
> 2. **National Science Foundation (NSF)**: NSF often has funding opportunities for research into energy efficiency, renewable energy technologies, and environmental impacts. 
> 
> 3. **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**: The EPA may provide funding for research related to the environmental effects of renewable energy options or carbon sequestration.
> 
> 4. **Department of Interior (DOI)**: As the Department of Interior oversees the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, funding for marine spatial planning and offshore energy could be available.
> 
> 5. **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**: NOAA has interests in marine spatial planning and offshore energy.
> 
> 6. **Department of Defense (DoD)**: The Office of Naval Research and other DoD divisions may be interested in funding research in offshore energy, especially as it relates to naval and military applications, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and carbon capture technologies.
> 
> 7. **United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)**: In rural areas, USDA projects related to bioenergy, wind energy, and green industries might be relevant.
> 
> 8. **Foundations and Nonprofits**: Many foundations aim to support innovative research on renewable energy, ocean conservation, and environmental law, such as the Energy Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
> 
> 9. **International Bodies**: You could also look at international organizations such as the European Commission's Horizon Europe program or the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
> 
> 10. **Private Industry Partnerships**: Depending upon your research's commercial potential, partnerships with energy companies might be feasible.
>    
> Each funding opportunity has its specific areas of interest and eligibility requirements. It's crucial to examine the detailed program announcements to see if your research fits within a particular program's scope.
