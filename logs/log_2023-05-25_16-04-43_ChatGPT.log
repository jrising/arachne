> I am writing a draft of the economy-wide results section for an analysis of the contribution of Delaware's coastal region to the state's economy. The discussion should roughly mirror what was done in a 2012 report on the same topic. Here is that section from the 2012 report:
> ---
> Application of Multiplier Analysis to Delaware’s Coast-Related Activities
> 
> In the following tables we present the results of analysis of the economic impacts of coast-related activity on the economy of the state of Delaware. Table 1 shows that direct coast-related activity accounts for 39,900 additional jobs, $4.1 billion in added industry production, and $1.6 billion in added labor income.  After adding in indirect and induced (multiplier) activity, the total economic contributions of coast-related activity to the state:
> 
>  - $6.9 billion added to total industry production
>  
>  - 59,000 additional jobs supported
>  
>  - $2.5 billion of additional labor income
>  
>  - $711 million of additional local, state, and federal taxes
> 
> Direct coast-related activity has multiplied effects on the state’s economy. For example:
> 
>  - $67 of additional production is added throughout the state for every $100 of direct coast-related production (a production multiplier of 1.67)
> 
>  - 48 additional jobs are added throughout the state for every 100 direct coast-related jobs (a jobs multiplier of 1.48)
> 
>  - $59 of additional labor income is added throughout the state for every $100 of direct coast-related labor income
> 
> Comparing to Other Economic Sectors
> 
> These results compare to a recent analysis of the contributions of the agricultural sector (including the processing of agricultural products), which total approximately $8 billion in industry production. Thus the production contributions of coast-related activities are closely comparable to those of agriculture.7, 8 However, because agriculture requires fewer workers to produce each dollar of production, the total number of jobs attributable to the agricultural sector is substantially smaller than those attributed to the coastal economy in this study.9
> 
> These results can also be compared to a recent analysis of the value of tourism in Delaware.10 That study found total tourism spending in all of Sussex County of $1.5 billion, whereas our analysis of coast-related direct spending found a total of $4.1 billion. A similar comparison can be made in terms of jobs where the tourism study found 15,000 jobs in tourism, while we find 40,000 direct coast-related jobs. The tourism figure is based on short visits whereas the coastal zip code activities include not only short tourism visits but also the activities of long-term coastal residents. The tourism study found that food and beverage spending in all of Sussex County by short-term tourists amounted to $189 million, while our analysis of coast-related activity finds $446 million annually for the combination of short- and long-term spending in food service and drinking places.

> 
> Also, here is the equivalent section from a report on the Inland Bays region of Delaware:
> ---
> Findings
> 
> Based on the defined study region, relevant industries, and existing economic data, RIMS II estimates that the Delaware Inland Bays support $4.5 billion in economic activity and over 35,000 jobs throughout the state of Delaware. This value represents the direct, indirect, and induced economic contributions of the Delaware Inland Bays.
> 
> Approximately 89% of these contributions and 94% of the jobs occur within Sussex County ($4.0 billion in economic activity and 33,774 jobs) (Table 2), with 11% of the contributions and 6% of the jobs ($511 million in economic activity and 2,345 jobs) occurring more broadly in Delaware (Table 3).
> 
> The majority of the economic contributions come from industries that are necessary to support residents who live in proximity to the Inland Bays (e.g. infrastructure and services). This includes residential and non-residential construction, grocery stores, health care services, and real estate.

> Analysis of the Economic Impact of Coastal Activities in Delaware
> 
> In this section, we present an analysis of the economic impacts of coastal activity on Delaware's economy. The data presented in Table 3 illustrates the direct, indirect, and induced economic contributions of coastal activities.
> 
> Direct coastal activities alone have led to the addition of 44,450 jobs, $3.74 billion in labor income, and $7.72 billion in industrial output. Following the inclusion of indirect and induced activities, the total economic contributions of coastal activities to the state are significant:
> 
> - $12.06 billion added to total industrial output
> - 64,710 additional jobs supported
> - $5.49 billion in additional labor income
> 
> The effect of direct coastal activities on the state's economy has a pronounced multiplicative effect. For instance:
> 
> - For every $100 of direct coastal-related production, an additional $70 is generated throughout the state, resulting in a production multiplier of 1.7.
> - Every 100 direct coast-related jobs give rise to an additional 60 jobs across the state, culminating in a jobs multiplier of 1.6.
> - Every $100 of direct coast-related labor income stimulates an additional $70 in labor income across the state.
> 
> It's worth noting that the majority of these economic contributions are driven by industries vital to supporting residents who live in proximity to the coast (e.g., infrastructure and services). These industries encompass residential and non-residential construction, grocery stores, healthcare services, and real estate.
> 
> Coast-related activities continue to play a significant role in Delaware's economy, not just in terms of the sizeable economic output and labor income they generate, but also in their capacity to create jobs and stimulate additional economic activities statewide. The interplay of direct, indirect, and induced impacts magnifies the overall economic significance of these activities, underscoring the importance of Delaware's coastal region in the broader state economy.

**user**:
> The next section looks at a the break-down of contributions for number of specific sectors. Here is the discussion on these results from the 2012 report:
> ---
> Table 2 shows the top-ten industry sectors impacted by coast-related activity, whether direct, indirect, or induced. These sectors (which include a large number of component activities) can be regarded as barometers of coastal economic activity.
> 
> Not surprisingly, restaurants, bars, and other places where food is served to consume on premises or to take out (in Table 2 the sector is called food services and drinking places) comprise the top sector in terms of jobs (7,332). As would be expected, retail stores (including grocery stores, supermarkets, and outlet malls) have high employment impacts, representing the third-largest employment impact (3,537) when both retail categories in Table 2 are combined.
> 
> The top sector for labor income is medical facilities ($205.5 million) because of the high wages paid in this sector. The medical facilities sector also ranks high (third) in terms of job impacts. In addition, the sector comprising offices of dentists, physicians, and other health practitioners is ranked third for income and fifth for jobs. The high ranks of medical facilities (hospitals, etc. in Table 2) and services (offices of health practitioners in Table 2) attest to the importance of retirees to Delaware’s coastal communities as well as to the continuing rise of the importance of the health care sector in the national economy (it now generates 18 percent of gross domestic product).
> 
> The top sector in terms of the value of production is real estate ($504.9 million) because of its high level of direct activity. Real estate is also high (second) in terms of job impacts.
> 
> The top sectors in terms of production multipliers are government (2.5) and business and professional associations, a category that includes organizations such as homeowners associations, the CHEER home health care agency, volunteer firefighters, and chambers of commerce (2.2). These two sectors both purchase proportionately more inputs from other sectors than most sectors do.
> 
> The last three sectors in the table (employment services, business and professional associations, and services to buildings) reflect the importance of service activities both in the coastal community and in the economy as a whole. In the coastal area these sectors are especially important in supporting both the short-term and long- term tourism communities.
> 
> The Impact of Seasonal Homes
> 
> Seasonal homes in the coastal area are part of coast-related activity, but their effects are not fully measured through the channels enumerated in the Methodology section.
> 
> Seasonal homes are occupied by visitors who shop, dine, purchase entertainment, sightsee, and go to the beach. All of these activities are captured in the analysis presented. In addition, the rental payments that the visitors make when they occupy seasonal homes are largely handled by coastal real estate agencies, which collect their fees (often 10 percent) from the rents.
> 
> However, the balance of the rents is remitted to the owners. If the owners live in the coastal community themselves, then the impact of the rental income is already accounted for in our estimates. If the owners live outside of Delaware (e.g., Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York, etc.), then the rental income they receive has no impact in Delaware except to the extent that they spend part of it when they make trips to stay for vacationing or for maintenance and taxes.  The part of the rental income that has not been accounted for in the preceding analysis is the rental income of non-coastal resident Delaware owners not spent in the coastal community when they make visits to the coast and not paid to rental agencies. Even this amount is largely paid to the banks that hold the mortgages on the properties and these banks may be out of state. New construction is already captured in the preceding analysis.
> 
> A recent report on the value of tourism in Delaware attributes a total rental value for the roughly 35,000 seasonal second homes in Sussex County of $869.3 million in 2010. Of course, all of those are not in the coastal area—perhaps 10 percent— leaving approximately $783 million for the coastal area. If 10 percent is typically paid to rental agents, the balance is $705 million. If 15 percent is received by coastal area residents and another 65 percent is received by non-Delaware residents, the balance for Delaware non-coastal residents (20 percent) is $141 million. If owners on average retain 25 percent of the income after mortgages, taxes, and other expenses, this amounts to a $35 million increase in direct incomes to statewide non-coastal area residents that might be spent in the state.  This compares with the total direct spending in the coastal area of $2.5 billion (Table 1), so the increment to total spending might amount to 1.4 percent. We do not include this amount in the preceding analysis and tables of results because we regard it as being subject to more assumptions, creating more uncertainty about it than for the other parts of the analysis. This omission is one factor that, other things being equal, makes our reported results conservative.

> Breakdown of Contributions by Specific Sectors
> 
> Table 4 offers a detailed perspective of the top ten industry sectors influenced by coastal-related activities, considering direct, indirect, and induced impacts. These sectors serve as indicators of the economic vitality of Delaware's coastal region.
> 
> As anticipated, the sector comprising of restaurants, bars, and places offering food services (to consume on the premises or for takeout) is the most significant in terms of employment, providing 11,660 jobs. Retail stores, encompassing grocery stores and clothing and accessories shops, are also significant contributors to employment, cumulatively supporting 3,690 jobs.
> 
> Medical care facilities, including hospitals and nursing homes, stand as the leading sector concerning labor income, generating $513.5 million, attributable to the high wages in this field. This sector also ranks high in terms of employment, standing third. The offices of healthcare practitioners also make considerable contributions to labor income and employment, reinforcing the significance of healthcare in Delaware's coastal communities and its ever-increasing importance in the national economy.
> 
> Real estate rental and management is the top contributor regarding production value, adding $1.09 billion to the state's economy. The high level of direct activity in this sector also makes it the second-largest contributor to employment.
> 
> In terms of production multipliers, the state and local government and the sector encompassing business, professional, labor, civic, social, and homeowners’ organizations stand out with multipliers of 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. This reveals their greater propensity to purchase inputs from other sectors, thereby stimulating additional economic activity.
> 
> The presence of sectors such as employment services and services to buildings in the top ten highlights the importance of service activities in the coastal economy. In the coastal area, these sectors play a crucial role in supporting both short-term and long-term tourism communities.
> 
> The "value added" figures in Table 4 reflect the net economic value each sector contributes to the economy. It's calculated by subtracting the cost of inputs from the total value of output. This measure provides a more accurate picture of a sector's economic contribution than output alone, as it avoids double-counting the value of inputs.
> 
> The multiplier effect illuminates how an additional dollar spent in each sector resonates throughout the economy, generating indirect and induced impacts. Although the multipliers in Table 4 aren't equivalent to those for the total economic contributions, they still illustrate the ripple effect of each dollar spent within these sectors.
> 
> In conclusion, sectors such as tourism, real estate, and healthcare play pivotal roles in Delaware's coastal economy. Their direct, indirect, and induced contributions not only generate considerable value but also stimulate further economic activities, reinforcing the significance of these sectors in the overall coastal economy.

**user**:
> Finally, I would like a draft of a section on taxes generated by the coastal region. Here is the equivalent section in the 2012 report:
> ---
> Coast-Related Activity Effects on State, Local, and Federal Taxes
> 
> Table 3 shows that the total of all additional taxes paid to local, state, and federal governments as a result of coast-related activity (including its multiplier effects) is $711 million. The significant tax effects of coast-related activity should therefore be of great interest to various governments. The total includes $226 million in state and local taxes (32 percent of the total) and $485 million in federal taxes (68 percent). The state and local tax payments of $226 million represent roughly 4 percent of total state and local taxes paid by businesses and households in Delaware. The federal tax payments of $485 million represent roughly 3 percent of the total federal taxes paid by businesses and households in Delaware.
> 
> Of the state and local taxes, more than half ($130 million of the total of $226 million) are paid as indirect business taxes, including business gross receipts taxes of $59 million and non-tax fees (e.g., licenses, inspections, government owned utility charges, permits, etc.) of $26 million. Corporate income taxes add an additional $12 million in state tax revenues. Households throughout the state pay roughly one-third ($72 million) of state and local taxes generated by the coastal economy, the majority of which is in the form of personal income tax ($63 million). Households also pay $175 million in federal income taxes and an additional $130 million in payroll (social insurance—Social Security, Medicare, etc.) taxes, which together constitute 63 percent of additional federal taxes. The balance comes mostly from the employers’ share of payroll taxes ($132 million) and corporate profits taxes ($25 million). Small business proprietors pay $6 million and various indirect business taxes paid to the federal government total $18 million.
> ---
> 
> And here is the equivalent section in the Inland Bays report:
> ---
> Tax Revenues
> 
> Economic activity within the Inland Bays study region also provides tax revenue to federal, state, and county governments. Sources of revenue include taxes and fees levied on businesses, personal income tax, property taxes, and real estate transfer taxes.  These tax revenues were estimated as a proportion of the total tax revenue generated by the coastal economy of Delaware. A supporting case study for tourism-related taxes is also provided.
> 
> Federal, State, and County Tax Revenues
> 
> Tax revenue to federal, state, and county governments were estimated as a proportion of the total tax revenue generated by the coastal economy of Delaware. This value was calculated in 2011, which was published in The Contribution of the Coastal Economy to the State of Delaware (2012).  In 2011, tax revenue for the total coastal economy was estimated to be $711 million, which equates to $833 million in 2020 dollars based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The total coastal economy of Delaware was estimated to be $6.9 billion, which equates to $8.1 billion in 2020 dollars. The value of the Inland Bays economy, estimated in this report, is approximately $4.5 billion, which constitutes approximately 57% of the total coastal economy of Delaware. This ratio suggests that tax revenue generated by the Inland Bays is approximately $458 million (57% of $711 million).
> 
> Tourism-Related Tax Revenues
> 
> The estimate of federal, state, and local tax revenue calculated for the Inland Bays study region consists of specific sources, which include several pertaining directly to tourism. According to the Delaware Tourism Office, $223.8 million in tourism-initiated state and local taxes were collected in Sussex County in 2019 (M. Chesney, Delaware Tourism Office, personal communication, May 25, 2021; Delaware Tourism Office, 2020), equivalent to $226.5 million in 2020 dollars (adjusted using the CPI)2. The amount of this total tax revenue attributed to the Inland Bays was estimated by multiplying $226.5 million by the portion of travel-related economic activity in Sussex County occurring in the Inland Bays region, which is approximately 79%. Based on this approach, the Inland Bays contribute approximately $178.9 million tourism-initiated state and local taxes, which is approximately 39% of the $458 million in tax revenue estimated herein.

> Tax Implications of Coastal Activities
> 
> Activities within the coastal region significantly contribute to tax revenue for local, state, and federal governments. This is apparent in the wide array of tax and fee revenue sources, such as business levies, personal income tax, property taxes, and real estate transfer taxes. Notably, the comprehensive economic impact of the coastal region on Delaware's fiscal landscape extends beyond direct tax generation, by also stimulating indirect and induced tax revenues. 
> 
> According to Table 5, the total tax revenue generated by the coastal region amounts to over $1 billion. Of this total, approximately $328 million is accrued to state and local governments while the federal government receives around $710 million. 
> 
> The direct tax payments to the state and local authorities tally up to about $185 million, while the indirect and induced tax effects account for an additional $143 million. Similarly, federal tax payments are heavily influenced by these secondary effects. Direct federal tax payments amount to approximately $458 million, while indirect and induced tax payments contribute an additional $251 million.
> 
> A detailed breakdown of the local tax contributions shows that approximately $11 million goes to sub-county general coffers, while around $38 million goes to sub-county special districts. Meanwhile, county governments directly receive about $27 million. 
> 
> In the grand scheme of Delaware's economy, these tax payments hold significant weight. The state and local tax revenues of approximately $328 million constitute a considerable portion of total taxes paid by businesses and households in Delaware. Similarly, the federal tax payments of $710 million represent a notable percentage of total federal taxes paid by Delaware entities. 
> 
> In summary, the coastal region plays a critical role in sustaining Delaware's tax revenue streams, contributing over a billion dollars annually in direct, indirect, and induced tax payments. This tax revenue underscores the economic significance of the coastal region and supports various public services and infrastructure at local, state, and federal levels. Therefore, investment in this region has far-reaching fiscal implications and contributes to the overall economic health of the state and beyond.
