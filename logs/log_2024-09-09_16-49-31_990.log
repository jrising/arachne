> Co-hosted by the Building Innovation Hub and HOK, a global design, architecture, and engineering firm, this in-person event explores how we tackle complex building decarbonization challenges with holistic, cooperative approaches. This event will bring together regional leaders, including building owners, designers, and service providers as well as government officials and nonprofit partners. The event will include opening remarks by Anica Landreneau (HOK) and Theresa Backhus (Building Innovation Hub/Institute for Market Transformation). There will be one hour of programmatic content. Attendees will choose two of the three available panels: electrification, financing, and complex challenges.  Each panel will have one panel emcee and three speakers. The speakers will have 5 min to present a case study that highlights a success in building decarbonization. The audience will have 15 min to ask questions. At the 30 min mark, attendees will rotate to a different panel session. The electrification panel speakers include: Mansi Talwar, George Washington University; Laura Morder, GHT; and Dan McGee, Redbrick. The financing speakers include: Jim Landeau, MetLife; a speaker from DC Green Bank, and Shane Pollin, PS Ventures. The complex challenges speakers include: Melanie Goerke, HITT Construction; James Ball, DC Net Zero Coalition; Linda Toth, Arup.

**assistant**:
> ## Case Study: Planning the Decarbonizing DC Event with IMT and HOK
> 
> ### Introduction
> In the summer of 2024, the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) and HOK, a global design, architecture, and engineering firm, collaborated on organizing a high-profile event titled "Decarbonizing DC: Better Buildings through Innovation and Collaboration." This case study highlights the successful planning process of the event, key outcomes, and lessons learned for future endeavors.
> 
> ### Planning Process
> The planning process began approximately 13 weeks before the event date, with stakeholders from IMT and HOK convening to outline objectives, tasks, and timelines. Clear roles and responsibilities were assigned to team members to ensure seamless coordination. The team identified key elements such as speaker recruitment, sponsorship outreach, logistical arrangements, and promotional strategies.
> 
> ### Key Decisions and Milestones
> Throughout the planning phase, several critical decisions were made to steer the event towards success. These decisions included setting the event title, determining the ticket price, finalizing the event agenda, securing sponsors, and defining learning objectives. Regular meetings were held to track progress, address challenges, and make necessary adjustments.
> 
> ### Successful Implementation
> The event planning process unfolded smoothly, with effective communication, collaboration, and proactive problem-solving. Sponsorship targets were achieved, a diverse range of speakers were confirmed, and promotional materials were disseminated efficiently. The team leveraged technology for tasks such as digital poster submissions and online RSVP management, streamlining operational processes.
> 
> ### Key Outcomes
> The Decarbonizing DC event proved to be a resounding success, drawing a significant audience of industry professionals, government officials, and sustainability advocates. Attendees engaged with insightful presentations, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. The event facilitated knowledge sharing on decarbonization strategies, financing challenges, and regulatory implications in the built environment.
> 
> ### Lessons Learned
> 1. **Early Planning is Essential**: Initiating event planning well in advance allows for comprehensive preparation and avoids last-minute complications.
> 2. **Clear Communication**: Maintaining transparent and open communication channels among team members fosters collaboration and ensures alignment towards common goals.
> 3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Being adaptable to unforeseen circumstances and ready to pivot strategies as needed enhances event resilience.
> 4. **Sponsorship Diversification**: Diversifying sponsorship sources can help mitigate financial risks and broaden industry partnerships.
> 5. **Post-Event Evaluation**: Conducting a thorough post-event evaluation to gather feedback, assess outcomes, and identify areas for improvement is crucial for iterative growth.
> 
> ### Conclusion
> The collaborative effort between IMT and HOK in organizing the Decarbonizing DC event exemplifies effective event planning, stakeholder engagement, and knowledge-sharing within the sustainability community. By leveraging best practices, embracing challenges, and learning from experiences, future events can continue to drive positive impact and innovation in sustainable building practices.
