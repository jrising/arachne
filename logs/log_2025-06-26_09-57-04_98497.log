> Accelerating Investment in Adaptation and Resilience by Finance Ministries and Economic Decision-Makers: The Macroeconomic Case for Action
> 
> Partners: Grantham Institute on Climate Change and Environment (LSE), Marsh McLennan, Paul Watkiss Associates, and University of Delaware in partnership with the Gates Foundation. 
> 
> Introduction & Context
> The physical impacts of climate change are increasing at an alarming rate and have become macro-critical issues, with the budgetary impacts and fiscal pressures from extreme events growing in many countries and significantly affecting the responsibilities of economic decision-makers worldwide. Yet whilst there has been an increase in investment in adaptation, it remains severely underfunded across all countries, with inadequate engagement from Finance Ministers, key economic decision-makers, and Heads of State.
> 
> A recent survey of nearly a third of the world’s finance ministries (Coalition of Finance Ministers, 2025) shows that whilst the vast majority of Finance Ministries are concerned about the impacts of physical climate risk on key macroeconomic indicators, few have integrated climate risk into their core analytical tools for macro-forecasting or budgeting. 
> 
> To respond to this need, the Gates Foundation in partnership with a range of organisations and the COP30 Presidency is preparing a range of products to inform the adaptation discussions in the run up to COP30 in Belém, Brazil. The overall intention is to build a package of products that can reference each other and jointly create a compelling case for adaptation for COP30.
> 
> In support of this work and beyond, this project aims to provide a compelling body of work that highlights the macroeconomic costs and fiscal consequences of inaction and the substantial benefits of strategic investment in climate adaptation. This project dovetails with GRI / LSE’s initiative on Economic Analysis for Green and Resilient Transitions with the Coalition of Finance Ministers under Helsinki Principle 4 on mainstreaming climate into macro and fiscal policy and aims to provide new information to that community.
> 
>  
> Objectives
> 1.	Review & Synthesis: Conduct a comprehensive global review of existing literature to assess the economic costs of inaction and the benefits of adaptation investments. This review will focus on macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes at the national level, with quantitative evidence of impacts from across the globe.
> 2.	Case Studies Development: Analyse the adaptation outcomes in countries like the UK, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh, focusing on success factors, financing mechanisms, and national-scale benefits. These will provide the central link between macroeconomic outcomes and government action. We will also provide comparative assessments of the differential economic outcomes of investing in, and failure to invest in, adaptation and resilience. 
> 3.	Promote Evidence-Based Policy: Provide Finance Ministries with actionable insights for integrating adaptation into fiscal planning and strategies to communicate the economic advantages of adaptation, including its role in unlocking international funding and supporting national development objectives.
> 
> Our main value add will be to give an enhanced focus to the impacts of inaction for the public purse, real world case studies, and targeted guidance for Finance Ministries, who look after public financing worth over $30 trillion per annum globally. 
> 
> The main quantitative outcomes the project will focus on will be country-specific estimates of the impacts of physical climate risk on macroeconomic variables, including GDP, productivity, capital loss, interest rates, and inflation, and fiscal variables, including borrowing costs, credit ratings, public expenditure and revenue. Adaptation benefits will be quantified in terms of national-level costs, avoided impacts, and co-benefits. All of these will be estimated from multiple sources, including country-specific studies, with uncertainty and under multiple scenarios.
> 
> 
> Methodology & Approach
> The project will employ a mix of literature review and meta-analysis, relevant deep-dives, and interviews with economic decision-makers. The major workstreams of the project are:
> •	Literature Collection: We are engaged in a large-scale literature review with a focus on quantitative macroeconomic, fiscal, and adaptation investment outcomes. This draws upon grey literature, academic studies, and contributions to the forthcoming Compendium of Practice from the Coalition of Finance Ministers. We also use an AI-aided approach to filter through 40,000 academic papers to extract relevant country-specific results.
> •	Macroeconomic Meta-Analysis: Extending an ongoing study of the impacts of climate change on GDP growth, we will develop best-available estimates of future losses to country-level GDP over the next 50 years. This work also captures risks from sea-level rise, trade relations, and capital loss.
> •	Macroeconomic Reanalysis: To synthesise multiple lines of evidence on macroeconomic variables, we will use a statistical “reanalysis” and benefits transfer model. The outputs of this model will be a full range of macroeconomic variables of interest for each country with uncertainty.
> •	Country Case Studies: Case studies will look at real-world examples of how countries have invested, or failed to invest, in large-scale adaptation. These will provide concrete lessons for economic decision-makers and show how local adaptation decisions translate into macroeconomic outcomes.
> •	Interviews: To achieve the objectives above, it is critical to understand the real-world needs and constraints of Finance Ministries and economic decision-makers. Interviews with 10-15 of these stakeholders will focus on (1) perspectives on which types of investments are most compelling, under what circumstances, and how international funding and policy dynamics can be optimized to support adaptation efforts, (2) providing deeper insight for the case studies, and how they show successful adaptation strategies or challenges in implementation, and (3) providing feedback on preliminary findings to help us refine our communications approach to better resonate with economic policymakers and influencers.
> •	Framework Development: The evidence above will be used to offer a case for action to Ministries of Finances and economic decision-makers. Experts involved in the project will provide thought-leadership on how these groups can understand the key challenges and benefits of adaptation investment, and craft a planning and financing process to ensure success.
>  
> 
> Key Milestones 
> The project will produce its main outcomes in the lead-up to COP30.
> •	Interim results, consisting of the outcomes of the literature synthesis, including national-level macroeconomic and fiscal impacts and adaptation benefits will be available in August.
> •	A finalised literature synthesis and case study materials will be shared publicly in October. This will include a database of quantitative outcomes and estimated benefits of adaptation, based on the literature, for each country.
> •	The final report, to be shared in November, will break down risks by region, economy, and UNFCCC party groups.

**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a concise paragraph summarizing the project:
> 
> The project "Accelerating Investment in Adaptation and Resilience by Finance Ministries and Economic Decision-Makers" is an ambitious collaborative effort led by the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and Environment (LSE), in partnership with Marsh McLennan, Paul Watkiss Associates, and the University of Delaware, supported by the Gates Foundation. Aimed at highlighting the macroeconomic costs and fiscal consequences of inaction, it seeks to empower finance ministries globally by integrating climate risk into their macro-forecasting and budgeting tools. By conducting comprehensive reviews, developing case studies, and engaging directly with economic decision-makers, the project will provide actionable insights and a compelling case for adaptation investment, culminating in strategic publications leading up to COP30 in Brazil.
