> Can I use read.csv to read only the first two columns of a CSV in R?
**assistant**:
> Indeed, you can use the `read.csv` function in R to read only the first two columns of a CSV file. While `read.csv` doesn't directly support selecting specific columns during the read operation, you can achieve this efficiently by reading the entire dataset and then subsetting the desired columns.
> 
> Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. Read the entire CSV file.
> 2. Subset the dataframe to keep only the first two columns.
> 
> ```R
> # Read the entire CSV file
> data <- read.csv("path/to/your/file.csv")
> 
> # Subset to keep only the first two columns
> data_subset <- data[, 1:2]
> 
> # Display the subset data
> print(data_subset)
> ```
> 
> By performing subsetting after the data is read in, you ensure that your operations remain uncomplicated and error-free.
