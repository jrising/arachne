**user**:
> I have a google domain registered domain, openmodeling.org. And I can see the site if I go to "http://openmodeling.org/". But when I try to go to "https://www.openmodeling.org/", I get the error "This site can’t be reachedwww.openmodeling.org’s DNS address could not be found." How do I add "www." as an option to my domain?
**assistant**:
> Sure, I can help with that. You'll need to add a new CNAME record to your DNS management in Google Domains. Here's how to do that:
> 
> 1. Sign in to Google Domains.
> 2. Click ```My domains``` in the navbar and then click the domain you want to use.
> 3. Open the menu .
> 4. Click ```DNS``` icon.
> 5. Scroll down to the ```Custom resource records``` section.
> 6. Under ```Name``` type "www". 
> 7. Under ```Type``` select "CNAME" from the drop-down menu. 
> 8. In the ```TTL``` field, you can set the Time To Live. 1H is a common value.
> 9. Under ```Data``` enter "openmodeling.org." (without quotation marks but include the period at the end).
> 10. Click ```Add``` button.
> 
> The addition of this CNAME record will essentially tell any DNS servers querying 'www.openmodeling.org' to redirect to 'openmodeling.org.' Please note, DNS changes might take some time (up to 24 to 48h, but usually much less) to propagate through the internet.
> 
> After the propagation period, you should be able to reach your site using "www.openmodeling.org". Just be aware, the site might need time to update its SSL certificate to include the www version of the domain.
> 
> Let me know if you need further help with this!
