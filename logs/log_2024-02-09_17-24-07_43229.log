> 15.1 Background (1.5 pg)
> 15.1.1 Rising Food Insecurity in West Africa (relate to SDGs)
> 
> The prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity across LLMICs has increased by an average 13% since 2015. In 2021, over half of LLMICs experienced food insecurity impacting at least 50% of their populations. West Africa is characteristic of this trend, and food insecurity has been rising in our main countries of interest, Senegal and Nigeria, since 2017 (see Fig. 1).

> 
> Food insecurity continues to rise, even as total per capita calories supply has increased across most of West Africa. This paradox of greater food availability butand greater food insecurity is driven by problems with unequitable and unreliable access to food, providing, inadequate nutrition in food consumed, and reliability, as well as by export-driven food production. Food wastage is also a growing problem across sub-Saharan Africa which needs to be addressed through better access to refrigeration and preservation techniques (Sheehan and Barrett, 2017). In the aquatic food production chain, improved implementation of safety and quality assurance systems will lead to safer food with higher nutritional quality, extended shelf-life and reduced post-harvest losses (GarridoGamarro et al, 2023).
> 
> The food system is complex, with some populations particularly vulnerable to near-term climate impacts. Such effects have significant implications for our ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. SDG 1, 2, 3, 13, 14 15). In particular, we will study health consequences in low-income countries like those in West Africa, and their most vulnerable populations, in collaboration with researchers having existing stakeholder relationships and access to on-the-ground data. Our approach emphasizes the impact of climate change on food production and ecosystem services, and the communities involved in food production. The project will co-create tools or data facilitating the resilience of these vulnerable groups to health risks, as well as design and suggest mitigation and adaptation policies and risk management.

> 
> 15.1.2 Role and Vulnerability of Small-holder Farmers and Fishers
> 
> Our focus will be on farmers and fishers and their surrounding communities in Nigeria and Senegal. The reason is that Nigeria and Senegal have a high prevalence of small-holder farming and fishing in West Africa. In 2010, there were 2.4 million farms in Nigeria using less than 1 ha of land, while 185,000 thousand farms used between 50 - 100 ha of land, but the former provided 90% of Nigeria’s agricultural produce.. Artisanal fishing is very important in Senegal not only in terms of volume and employment, but it also provides about 80 percent of the total catch. Artisanal fishing uses around 24,000 traditional pirogues, while the industrial fishing fleet consists of 280 vesselsships. 
> 
> Nigeria is home to approximately 184 million people—the largest population of all West African countries. The Nigerian agricultural sector is primarily rainfed and employs around 36% of the labor force in which more than 80% are non-homogenous smallholder farmers, and it contributed to 22% of Nigeria's GDP in the first quarter of 2020 (Afcfta 2020). Over 70% of Nigerians engage in the agricultural sector mainly at a subsistence level. Despite this activity, cumulative agriculture imports, over the years of 2016 and 2019, stood at N3.35 trillion. Major explanations for this situation, according to the FAO, are poor land tenure system, low level of irrigation farming, climate change and land degradation. Others are low technology, high production cost and poor distribution of inputs, limited financing, high post-harvest losses and poor access to markets.
> Senegal is a Low-Income Food-Deficit Country (LIFDC) with a population of The Senegalese population is around 16 million people. The fisheries sector is the second largest employer (15% of the labor force) and covers more than 75% of animal protein requirements. Fishing accounts for 3.5% of Senegal’s GDP, for a revenue estimated at €305 million. It accounts for 20.9% of revenue of exports (€176 million) (Dème et al. 2021). Stocks are however declining due to overexploitation, leading to a decline in productivity and a decreasing biodiversity along the coastline. The fishing sector in Senegal, as indicated, also faces severe challenges under climate change.
> Per capita annual consumption of fish in Senegal has been dropping from year to year (e.g., from 29 kg in 2008 to 16 kg in 2018). Per capita production is expected to be in the order of 32 kg/person/year if it were entirely destined for the domestic market (compared to the current 16kg/person/year). Despite the relatively low level of per capita fish consumption in Senegal which is a Low-Income Food-Deficit Country (LIFDC), the contribution of fish to animal protein intake is relatively large (24%) in Senegal. (Müller et al. 2011). The food supply of the Senegalese people remains dominated by rice and fishery products, including small pelagic fish. Prices of meat and chicken are too high for the poorest of the population and rising. Adverse developments in the fishing sector in Senegal as a result of climate change alone could have significant implications for people who depend on fish for food and as a source of nutrition, income and job opportunities, and the contribution of fisheries to Senegal’s national economy. as a country.

> 15.1.3 Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture and Fisheries
> The agricultural sector in Africa experiences severe challenges arising from climate change (Fofana 2011, Lokonon 2018, Adeleye et al 2021), and employs 55–62% of the sub-Saharan workforce and 95% of cropland is rainfed (Trisos et al. 2022, Osabohien et al. 2020). The effects of climatic shocks (e.g., heat intensity, variable rainfall) are predicted to result in depletion of soil nutrients, low productivity, shortage of food and welfare of the African farmers (Osabohien et al. 2020, Osofur and Nnorom 2014, Hatfield et al. 2018). Estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Trisos et al. 2022) indicate that future warming will negatively affect food systems in Africa by shortening growing seasons and increasing water stress. Although yield declines for some crops may be partially compensated by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrients are not expected to keep pace and global warming above 2°C will result in yield reductions for staple crops across most of Africa compared to 2005 yields (Trisos et al. 2022). Onyeneke et al. (2020) reviews the literature on the effect of climate change on the Nigerian agricultural sector.
> Climate change also affects fisheries and marine environments, by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean such as temperatures, pH, oxygen content and salinity (World Bank 2019, Kroetz et al. 2022, Abbot et al. 2022, Asche et al. 2022, Cojocaru et al. 2022). These attributes can contribute to undesirable impacts on fish stock movements but also fish habitats. Studies on the marine ecosystems indicate that warming oceans can have adverse effects such as restructuring of species composition (Fodrie et al. 2010, Wernberg et al. 2016, Flanagan et al. 2019); changes in species phenology (Edwards and Richardson 2004, Mills et al. 2013, Staudinger et al. 2019); changes in geographic species distributions (Pinsky et al. 2013, Poloczanska et al. 2013);  accessibility of target species to fisherman (Young et al. 2018, Pinsky and Fogarty 2012, Hughes et al. 2015); changes in stock productivity (Hare and Able 2007, Bell et al. 2014, Pershing et al. 2015); possible global loss of biomass in the oceans, especially at the middle and lower latitudes (Lotze et al. 2019); potential decline in landings by the 21st century on many of the most valuable fishing grounds (Cheung et al. 2010, Free et al. 2019).
> 
> 15.1.4 Importance of Ecosystem Services
> More broadly, these environments provide a multitude of globally important ecosystem services beneficial for human health and wellbeing (Hattam et al. 2015), including provisioning services (e.g., seafood, medicines) (FAO 2018), regulatory services (e.g., climate regulation, nutrient recycling) (van den Belt et al. 2016), and cultural services (e.g., recreation/tourism) (Rees et al. 2010). Aquatic food alone is a key source of protein for 3.2 billion people, especially in developing countries (FAO, 2018), and is the key to livelihoods for over 100 million small-scale fishers and aquaculture communities (Short et al. 2021). However, human actions have severely degraded global marine ecosystems’ abilities to deliver these services, with direct and indirect implications for the health of billions of people (Depledge et al. 2019, Fleming et al. 2019, Borja et al. 2020).
> 
> While existing research connects agricultural and fisheries productivity to climatic features (growing degree-days, rainfall, sea surface temperatures), the role of ecosystem services is understudied. We seek to fill this gap with this project by analyzing how the impacts of climate change could depend upon the gradual evolution of ecosystem health. Agriculture depends on ecosystem processes that ensure soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification. Fisheries need thriving habitats and balanced food webs. Such ecosystem services are likely to be affected by climate change factors.

> 15.1.5 Consequences of Malnutrition on Health
> 
> Food scarcity, due to crop failure and weakened fisheries, can lead to malnutrition and both acute health problems and long-lasting consequences for individuals and communities. Crop failure can lead to both reductions in availability of produce and access (e.g., through income loss). Weakened fisheries similarly undermine the availability and access to protein, as well as essential micronutrients unique to the aquatic food production chain (e.g. iodine, vitamin D, marine omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA)). Increased harmful algal blooms can also result in shellfish poisoning.
> 
> Lack of nutritious food helps to explain the high rates of stunting in these two countries: 31.5% in Nigeria and 17.9% in Senegal (World Bank Data).
> 15.2 Research plan (Intro: 0.5 pg)
> 
> Our research focuses on the implications of climate change on food production from staple crops and fishing sectors and subsequent consequences for health. We pay special attention to vulnerable populations, and small-holder farmers and fishersproducers in particular. The analysis further takes into account how ecosystem health mediates the relationships between climate change and outcomes for agriculture and fish productivity, food security and human health.

> 
> Methodology:
> Task 1.1.1: We will organize two stakeholder workshops in the first 6 months of the project in both Senegal and Nigeria. Within focus groups, stakeholders will be discuss (1) climatic regions, climate projections, and associated consequences for food production and communities; (2) socioeconomic and demographic trends and associated strains; (3) food supply, consumption demands, and markets; and (4) health drivers and trends, and their connection with nutrition. For each of these topics, stakeholders will consider available scientific evidence, and be asked to identify and prioritize research-relevant questions.

> 
> Task 1.1.3: Uncertain socioeconomic and climate scenarios will be constructed by combining a suite of Earth System Models (ESMs) under existing Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). SSPs that are consistent with stakeholder storylines will be identified or a weighted average of SSPs will be used. ESMs projected that produce warming patterns consistent with stakeholder storylines will then be paired with these SSPs. The resulting hazard information will be shared with stakeholders, and these constructed scenarios will be used throughout the project.

> WP2. Climate change effects on cropagriculture production (Lead: NASRDA) (1.5 pg.)
> 
> Overview and motivation: A quantitative and fine-scale understanding of cropping patterns is essential for evaluating climate-mediated linkages between crop production and nutritional outcomes in smallholder contexts. Yet this fundamental knowledge is lacking in Nigeria, Senegal, and other countries where traditional agricultural censuses are not regularly executed. This agricultural data scarcity is a critical information problem that limits an accurate picture of the state of agriculture and food security in many African countries and elsewhere and that prevents many nations from developing targeted interventions (Kebede et al., 2024). Using remote sensing and machine learning techniques offers a novel alternative for gathering agricultural data, evaluating the sensitivity of crop production to climate anomalies, and investigating knock-on effects to household food supply and nutrition. Resolving this agricultural data scarcity challenge in our focus countries is of high expected significance, as this new transferable, scalable approach to crop-type and yield mapping is directly applicable to informing agricultural and food security efforts in other data-scarce regions. Co-PIs Davis, Babamaaji, and Adeluyi have extensive experience in executing and implementing the entirety of the WP2 data pipeline.

> 
> WP2.1: AI-based mapping of staple crop productivity under current and future climate
> 
> Expected outcomes:
> - Field-scale maps of staple crop productivity with national coverage
> - Spatially-detailed estimates of crop yield anomalies under future climate
> - Transferable AI-based data pipeline for fine-scale crop mapping in data-scarce landscapes
> 
> Methodology: 
> We will employ remote sensing, deep/machine learning, and on-ground data collection to develop field-scale maps of cropped area and yields for staple crops (cassava, maize, millets, rice, sorghum, yams) within the focus regions. 
> Task W2.1.1: Automated field delineation: Training/validation data of field boundaries will be manually delineated using an existing QGIS labelling platform developed by co-PI Davis. This work is already underway. Locations of data collection will employ a stratified sampling that accounts for cropping intensity and agro-ecological zones. These data will be used to train and test deep learning convolutional neural networks to classify pixels in 3 meter cloud-free composite Planet imagery (Ref) into three categories: field edge; field interior; non-field. Pixels classified as field edge and interior will then be merged with the vectorized output of an image segmentation process to generate automated polygons for each field (Figure 5).  
> Task W2.1.2: Machine learning data pipeline for crop type mapping: In-country data gathering will collect ground-truth labels for crop type mapping in each field. We will use the Street2Sat pipeline (Paliyam et al., 2021) to convert georeferenced GoPro images into georeferenced labelled (crop-specific) point samples. Led by NASRDA, data will be collected using roof-mounted GoPro Hero 8 cameras. Within each GoPro image, individual plants will be assigned crop-type-specific bounding boxes via object detection (trained using manually labelled images). Combining information on field depth and image direction then allows the GPS coordinates of the vehicle image to be offset into the field (Figure 6). This crop type ground-truth data will be combined with field-delineated cropland maps (developed above) and seasonal median composite images for each band of Planet imagery and Sentinel 1 & 2 imagery (Ref) and input into Random Forest and Neural Network classifiers to assign a crop type to each individual field.

> Task W2.1.3: Field-scale yield modelling under current and future climate: Staple crop yields will be estimated following the protocol co-developed by NASRDA and the China National Space Administration. Ground-truth productivity estimates will be collected using handheld georeferenced smartphones equipped with a custom app to photographically evaluate crop status. Spatial yield estimates will be developed using both statistical (e.g., Jin et al., 2019) and process-based crop models (e.g., DSSAT; APSIM) taking into account crop type, soil characteristics, climate conditions, CO2 fertilization, and management practices. In collaboration with the GGCMI (Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison) Project, these models will also be used to evaluate changes in productivity under a suite of future climate scenarios to the year 2050 (specific scenarios to be identified in WP1).

> Methodology (Climate anomaly and diet diversity analysis: 
> Task W2.2.1: Random forest modeling of climate-and cross-validation:   We will evaluate a suite of variables to quantify climate anomalies, including mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperatures; diurnal temperature range; 5-year and 10-year rainfall anomalies. Infrastructural and demographic data of most parts of Nigeria are available from GRID3 Nigeria (grid3.gov.ng) and also the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS: https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/)l data will be leveraged for the project  analysis.          We applied a random forest machine learning algorithm to evaluate the correlation between annual rates of cropland expansion/abandonment (by crop type) and a suite of climate variables. Random forest is a non-parametric statistical method that uses decision trees to perform regressions or classifications and is robust to overfitting (Breiman, 2001). This method has been previously applied in the analysis of agricultural outcomes (including planted area) in association with climate variables (Vogel et al., 2019; Hoffman et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2023). All data will be randomly partitioned into an 80% and 20% split for training and validation. Hyperparameters (i.e., the number of trees to build, maximum depth of the tree, minimum leaf node size, and number of features to use for splitting) used in each model were tuned based on a grid search approach (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). To estimate and compare the cropland change variance explained by climate variables, we will calculate R2 values from cross-validated predictions. 
> Task W2.2.2: Mixed effects regression modelling of association between cropland expansion/abandonment and child diet diversity:    Some of the main health data will come from the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) (DHS 2008, 2013, 2018[MP3] ), which are nationally representative household-level survey data on demography, health, and nutrition. We will use all DHS survey years for which georeferenced data were available. The DHS variables of interest are child age, wealth index, time to water, education of household head, improved toilet, improved water, and 24-hour recall for 10 food groups (which asks the respondents to recall what they feed their children under five in the previous 24 hours). This 24-recall variable is a qualitative measure of food consumption that indicates household access to different types of foods and is also a proxy for nutrient sufficiency of the diet of individuals (Kennedy et al., 2011). We will use this information to calculate our outcome variable of interest – individual diet diversity score (IDDS) for each child under 5. IDDS is calculated based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (Kennedy et al., 2011), and is a scale ranging from 1 to 10 based on the intake of 10 different types of food groups including: (a) cereal grains, (b) white tubers and root foods, (c) dark leafy greens, (d) vitamin A rich vegetables/tubers, (e) vitamin A rich fruits, (f) other fruits and vegetables, (g) meat and fish foods, (h) eggs, (i) legumes/nuts/seeds, and (j) milk and milk products. Other covariates variables used for this analysis are described in the section immediately below.    Population density data will come from NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) (CIESIN, 2018) database at a spatial resolution of 30-arcsec (1km). The year of the data used for an individual cluster will depend on the year of the DHS survey. We will average the population density over a 5-kilometer radius for each DHS cluster. We will calculate distance to roads using the Global Distribution of Roads dataset from NASA SEDAC (CIESIN, 2013). We will calculate distance to urban centers using the Gridded Population of the World database (version 1) from NASA SEDAC (MEA, 2005). We will calculate livestock density data using the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW3) database (Gilbert et al., 2010) which provides the global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, and ducks for the year 2010. In each country and for each type of livestock, a livestock unit will be calculated by taking the ratio of production in tonnes to the number of animals produced/slaughtered (FAOSTAT, 2023). This factor will then be multiplied by the population density rasters of each animal, and all rasters will be added to obtain the total livestock unit for each grid cell. We will average the livestock density within 10 kilometers of each DHS cluster and categorize it into 8 different quantile-based classes based on the distribution of the data for each country. Initial forest cover will be defined as any 30m by 30m pixel having a tree cover percentage of greater than 50% in the year 1999 using Tropical Moist Forest (TMF) dataset (Vancutsum et al., 2020), and all locations of known tree plantations (i.e., not native forests) will be excluded from our analysis. A pixel will be defined as experiencing forest loss when the pixel category changes from undisturbed in year t to degraded in year t+1. We will assume that any pixel experiencing forest loss undergoes complete forest loss and remains unforested for the remainder of the study period. We will not consider forest gain in our calculations of deforestation rates as areas of forest gain in the focus regions are much smaller than those of forest loss.        Using multilinear mixed effects regression models, we will assess the relationship between cropland expansion and IDDS, while controlling for multiple agroecological, geographic and socioeconomic variables that are known to influence diet diversity. We will use the survey years as random effects in our model. This will enable us to evaluate whether climate-associated changes in cropland are associated with changes in rural diet diversity.

> Climate change effects on marine ecosystems
> In addition to increases in mean sea temperature, globally by 0.88°C since before the Industrial Revolution, extreme events are expected to become more frequent. Marine heat waves are episodes of sharp increases in ocean temperature. Intensity, duration and geographical scope can be very different, but they have the potential to have a large (negative) effect on organisms and ecosystems.
> 
> The ongoing increase in concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere affects the acidity of seawater, which generally reduces the pH and saturation state of carbonate minerals (aragonite and calcite). Such changes in ocean chemistry are potentially a major challenge for several forms of marine life, potentially affecting fisheries. Further, model results and observations show that global warming leads to an expansion of the ocean areas with low oxygen or total oxygen deprivation. Accordingly, the volume of habitats for organisms like fish that depend on oxygen will shrink.
> 
> As a consequence, many marine species across various groups have since about 1950 undergone shifts in geographical range and seasonal activities in response to especially ocean warming and biogeochemical changes, such as oxygen loss, to their habitats (high confidence). This has resulted in shifts in species composition, abundance and biomass production of ecosystems, from the equator to the poles. Altered interactions between species have caused cascading impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning. In some marine ecosystems species are impacted by both the effects of fishing and climate changes (IPCC SROCC 2019.
> 
> In addition, WP3 will examine the repercussions on small-scale fishers, food security and nutrition, and aligning these analyses with the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project will include a forward-looking analysis, projecting fish production, stock and distribution, fish consumption, and health conditions up to the year 2050 under various climate change scenarios.
>

> Goals
> The primary goal of WP3 is to comprehensively map and characterize the historical, current, and anticipated impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and fishing. This involves a thorough assessment of the consequences of ocean warming, deoxygenation, and acidification on fish stocks, and fisheries, which serve as a crucial source of micronutrients for human consumption..

> Oceanographic data from EAF Nansen surveys, national surveys, satellite data and regional oceanographic models (ROMS - ref) will be combined into spatial representations of climate conditions from (2000 - 2023). These will be used as input into regional oceanographic and climate models (ref) to project oceanic and coastal climatic conditions to 2050 under the scenarios identified in WP1.
> 
> The historical status of the fish stocks will be analyzed based on scientific survey data from EAF Nansen survey, combined with national scientific surveys, national fisheries landing statistics, FAO catch statistics, CECAF assessment reports and reconstructed catch data (Sea Around Us). Projections of fish stock abundance for the next 1-2 years will be based on CECAF assessment reports, while projections of stock development until 2050 will be based on modelling (statistical, computational, assessment - TBD). 
> 
> Updated nutritional data from the commercially and nutritionally important fish and shellfish species in Senegal will be collated from the EAF Nansen programme , the FAO/INFOODS uFISH database complemented by data from the Aquatic Food Composition Database (AFCD) (Golden et al. 2021).  
> 
> Using input from WP1 future management scenarios for fisheries will be qualitatively evaluated using climate impact risk analyses as well as explored quantitatively through coupled climate-fishery-nutrition models to analyze the effects on fish stocks and nutrition under varied management actions (see Robinson et al 2022).

> WP4. Demand and Supply modelingEconomic Analysis of Fisheries and Food Crop Production (Lead: UD) (1.5 pg.)
> How do producers of staple foods make decisions on harvesting in response to not only biological conditions but also to economic conditions, when climate change also affects biological and economic factors crucial for the operation of fisheries and crop food production? What are the sufficient and necessary conditions for maintaining simultaneously a biological and economic equilibrium, and how climate change affects such equilibrium? What kind of incentives can be provided to the fishers and farmers to allocate their resources and harvest staple products of high value in terms of nutrients content without destabilizing the biological and economic equilibria?
> These are some of the main questions that this WP4 will deal with a new theoretical modeling and an econometric analysis of this modeling. To our knowledge such analysis has not yet been done for Senegal and Nigeria, and the answer to the last question has not yet been considered in the context of a bioeconomic modeling.
> Fish and agricultural land resources are important contributing factors to food security and good nutrition, and to populations' health. The sustained economic use and biological subsistence of these resources can be affected by climate change. To have a good guidance toward the cautious use of both such resources is necessary the gathering of biological data and analysis on the effect of climate change of the fish and agricultural land resources and ecosystems which WP2 and WP3 will provide. It is however also indispensable to have an economic analysis to explain why such scarce resources are used by the fishers and farmers in the way they are and how they could possibly be used better over the long run while they face undesirable changes in climate, and dependent on the biological characteristics of the marine and agricultural ecosystems. Economic analysis can help to make better choices by specifying the costs and benefits of every possible choice (Hannesson, 1993)[1]. A choice can be for example the type and number of fishes or crops that are harvested, and the chosen types and amounts are crucial because they determine producers’ revenues, nutrient content and the final health outcome of the consumers of such product types, as well as the dynamics of the marine and agriculture ecosystems.
> Goals of WP 4 are: Bioeconomic analysis of fish and farms and analysis of production-consumption gaps and consequently nutrient gaps of staple foods.
> WP4.1: To develop two bioeconomic models to analyze how fishers and farmers maximize net economic yield while maintaining sustainable ecological yield, and how such decision making could be affected by climate change.
> Expected outcomes:
> 1.     To obtain both an optimal fish-catch target which can be used as a framework to i) overcome overharvesting in light of climate change, and guide toward optimal catches that are required for stock rebuilding; and ii) reverse potential negative rents or profits by evaluating their production operations.
> 2.     To determine the optimal management of land-use and food crop production that can provide economic and environmental benefits, taking into account the impacts of climate change. 
> 3.      Analysis of the influence of existing policies to mitigate and adapt to the climate change effects, quota constraints, subsidies, and financial market constraints.
> 4.    Measurements of welfare effects on smallholders when prices and production change adversely due to climate change. Effects could be on the smallholders’ commercial activities and revenues.
>  
> Methodologies
> 1.     Static and dynamic models which simultaneously optimize both environmental and economic goals of the small-holders. The dynamic model takes into account that ecosystems characteristics and smallholders’ decisions in one year determine production and revenues in the following years.
> 2.     Econometric analysis of our theoretical bioeconomic models using data that will be provided by WP2 and WP3, and measure the degree by which climate change could affect the smallholders.
>  
> WP4.2: To study both the characteristics of and contributing factors (e.g., market prices, household incomes) to the current and prospective consumption of both fish and staple food crops in Senegal and Nigeria, respectively, and whether it will be met given the current and future fish and food crop production.
> 
> Expected outcomes:
> 1. To determine whether there are consumption-production gaps, by considering not only the sustainability, profitability and productivity of the fishing and agricultural sectors but also the patterns of and contributing factors to the consumption of fish and staple crops, and make projections of possible gaps for 2050.
> 2. Estimation of the short- and long-run income elasticities of demand for staple food, and determine how responsive is this demand to changes in income at the household level, especially for lower income groups. The long-run income elasticities will allow us to project the long-run demand for staple food consumption, and evaluate whether this is met and will be met by the current and future production.
> 3. Estimation of the responses of staple food consumption to price changes, and analyze to what degree staple food price rises would reduce staple food consumption across income groups. Staple food production could decrease due to climate change, and cause price rises.
> 4. To measure the welfare effects on households’ consumption of staple food products because of reductions in their production and rises in their prices resulting from climate change.
>  
> Methodologies
> 1.     Food consumption theory
> 2.     Use and analysis of local data and survey data (e.g., Demographic Health Service (DHS)), on staple food from different demographic, economic and social groups. Any possible gap on consumption data, will be complemented by using the actual fish harvesting and agricultural production using the methodology of Deaton and Zaidi (2002), FAO (2017) and Kébé (1998).
>  
> WP4.3: To extend our bioeconomic models to account for the possibility of implementing food nutrient requirements under different climate change scenarios.
>  
> Expected outcomes:
> 1. To determine how the ratio of the nutrition content of the agricultural crop to the agricultural production yield, or the ratio nutrition content of harvested fish to the maximum sustainable yield, profits and costs depend on the production technology and input mix chosen, and climate change.
> 2. To determine what kind of subsidies, tax deductions, low-price financing could incentivize smallholders to accomplish a food nutrient requirement policy.
>  
> Methodologies:
> Our bioeconomic model will consider the smallholder as a profit-maximizer who will seek out alternative production technologies that can allow her/him to produce staple food that have high levels of rich nutrients to benefit households.

> WP5 to determine whether the basic nutrition needs of the Nigerian and Senegalese populations are met and are sufficient enough for them to maintain healthy lives.
>  Other evidence suggests that urbanization also increases fish consumption and staple crops through changing preferences. The estimation of the long-run income elasticities will allow us to project the long-run demand for fisheries and agricultural crops consumption, and consequently evaluate whether consumption for fisheries and agricultural staple crops are currently met and whether will be met given the current and future fish and crop production (obtained from our bioeconomic modeling), respectively.

> Food security and nutrition (FSN) depends upon both the availability, access, and utilization (nutritional quality) of food (HLPE 2020). The outcomes of WP4 will provide information about the nature of the market basket of goods consumed by vulnerable communities in Nigeria and Senegal, along with their embedded nutritional content from WP2 and WP3.
> 
> Goal of WP5: This WP will analyze the impacts of the current staple food consumption on the  health of vulnerable populations in Nigeria and Senegal. Reduction in food wastage will also be considered within this context.
> 
> WP5.1. Estimate health outcomes. We will blend literature-based nutrition gap approaches with empirical approaches to estimate health outcomes. To do so, we will look at three levels of health outcomes: (Level 1) food quality and nutritional content; (Level 2) nutritional deficiencies; and (Level 3) morbidity and mortality. Level 1 simply describes the market basket in terms of its calories and nutrients. Level 2 compares level 1 to nutrient needs and accounts for variability, dietary supplements, and poisoning risk, and looks at outcomes such as micronutrient deficiencies. Level 3 looks at how these nutrition gaps translate into anthropometry, capturing stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and underweight (low weight for age) outcomes, and illness, such as diarrhea, anemia, malaria, heart disease, as well as childhood mortality.
> 
> Expected Outcomes:
> Future projections of food access for fish and agriculture, nutritional deficiencies, and health outcomes under the WP1 scenarios.
> Improved understanding of the relative strengths of econometric and epidemiological methodologies.
> 
> Methodology:
> Levels 2 and 3 can be studied through either literature-based approaches, drawing upon previously established relationships (e.g., Black et al. 2008, Green et al. 2016, Aboagye et al. 2021), or new multivariate regression analysis. Estimating the statistical relationship of nutrition intake on health outcomes is challenging because of the endogenous role of poverty and consumption. However, our approach provides the instrumental variables necessary for exposing the true risks driven by food production and nutrition. Using data from the Demographic Health Survey, we will develop new econometric relationships between Level 3 health outcomes as a function of Level 2 nutrition and Level 1 food access. Then we will compare these to literature-based estimates, evaluating the source of discrepancies. The table below shows some key relationships of interest:
> Food Access (Level 1)
> Nutritional Deficiency (Level 2)
> Health Outcome (Level 3)
> Comparison
> Daily calorie intake
> Undernutrition
> Stunting
> 44% reduction / 100 kcal (Green et al. 2016)
> Dietary diversity
> Malnourishment
> Wasting
> 13% reduction for adequate diversity (Aboagye et al. 2021)
> Fish consumption
> Vitamin A deficiency
> Increased risk of death
> 6.5% of deaths under 5 (Black et al. 2008)
> 
> Concretely, we will regress health outcomes (such as stunting prevalence) directly on food access measures (such as daily calorie intake), using data from DHS, as well as instrumenting food access using food consumption measures from WP4. This work will also build upon the approach in Deaton and Zaidi (2002), FAO (2017) and Kébé (1998).
> 
> The use of both literature-based and statistical approaches across these three cumulative levels provides multiple supporting lines of evidence for evaluating health issues. The synthesis of these lines of evidence will be an opportunity to incorporate other key aspects of the food system that are otherwise outside of the scope of the new analysis, including: aquaculture, livestock, and the role of fortification programs. Seasonal and unexpected variability in nutrition also plays a key role in determining health outcomes.
> 
> WP5.2. Policy and vulnerability analysis. We can further refine our identification of at-risk populations, by accounting for food availability and poverty (WP4) and household features (DHS). Human health outcomes can depend on, e.g., age and gender (demographic characteristics), health status, socio-economic conditions (including worker environments and labor conditions), adaptation policies, and the functioning of food and health systems. Nutritional deficiencies also have long-term consequences, e.g., on future health and income (Victora et al. 2008), which exacerbate existing inequalities.
> 
> Expected Outcomes:
> Produce policy recommendations from scenario-based health outcomes
> Generate metrics to be shared through the Food Security Futures Explorer.
> 
> Methodology:
> The metrics will be developed in consultation with the stakeholder groups under WP1.
> 
> With perishable items that cannot be retrieved, a circular economy for biomass conversion to fertilizer or energy should also be an option. The University of Delaware’s plan to develop a sustainable development hub for a circular food economy would be an important support mechanism for this project.
