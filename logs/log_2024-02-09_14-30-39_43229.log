> I'm trying to create a polygon by drawing it in QGIS. I click all around, and then instructions say to double click to finish it (that appears to just make the same point twice) and then "save changes" (but I see no place to save changes). It stays in editing mode, and the only way I have found to exit is the escape key which deletes my polygon. How do I save the polygon?
**assistant**:
> In QGIS, creating and saving a polygon involves a few steps. Here's how you might do it:
> 
> 1. **Start Editing Mode**: Select the layer you want to edit. Then click the pencil icon in the top toolbar to toggle editing mode.
> 
> 2. **Create a Polygon**: Use the "Add Polygon Feature" tool (icon with a polygon and a '+') and begin drawing your polygon. You will click once for each vertex you want to add. 
> 
> 3. **Finish the Polygon**: To finish the polygon, instead of double-clicking the last point (which will just create two points at the same place as you've noticed), click right mouse button anywhere on the map canvas. This will finish the polygon and you will see a small window asking for the attributes for that new feature.
> 
> 4. **Add Attribute Information**: Enter the attribute information for the new polygon in the small window that appears.
> 
> 5. **Save the Polygon**: Once you're finished adding points and attribute information, click the floppy disk icon in the toolbar to save your changes.
> 
> 6. **Exit Editing Mode**: Clicking the pencil icon again will exit editing mode.
> 
> If you're not seeing the save option (floppy disk icon) or the new feature attributes window isn't appearing, you may want to check if your QGIS installation is working correctly or if there's an update available. It's also possible that your layer is not editable, check if its properties allow for editing.
