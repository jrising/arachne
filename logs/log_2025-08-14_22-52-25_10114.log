> Missing risks are estimated using two approaches. First, we use the relatively exhaustive list of channels in CCRA3, each of which was assessed very approximately for future time periods (e.g., \pounds tens of millions / year) and informed by tables from published analyses. We interpret the approximate assessments as a range (e.g., \pounds 10 million to \pounds 100 million) and separately produce mean and standard deviation estimates from the CCRA text describing each section, and combine these distributions. Where values are missing, we extrapolate from existing values for the same impact when possible and randomly draw from other impacts otherwise. Then we drop channels that are already assessed by other models. Double-counting, according to overlaps described in CCRA3, and covariance, based on underlying hazards, is accounted for using the method in \cite{rising2022missing}.
> The result is 0.11\% GDP [0.06--0.17\%] in the current period, falling in mean but increasing in uncertainty to 0.04\% GDP [-0.19\% to 0.25\%] by the end of the century.
> 
> Second, following \cite{nordhaus2013climate}, we estimate losses from missing risks as a fraction (25\%) of known risks. Since we have multiple models for most channels, we bootstrap this approach, randomly drawing a model from each impact channel, summing them, and then calculating the missing risks. The result is a loss of 0.66\% GDP [0.19--1.21\%] in the current period, increasing in magnitude and uncertainty to 2.06\% GDP [-0.86\% to 5.11\%] by end of century. Our final estimate of missing risks draws randomly from these two methods for each climate Monte Carlo run.

**assistant**:
> The method description in the appendix appears to align well with what is stated in the main text for the CCRA3 risk estimation. Here's how they correspond:
> 
> 1. **Quantifying Ranges:** Both descriptions mention using ranges from the CCRA3 report to establish low and high bounds and calculating mean and standard deviation estimates.
> 
> 2. **Translation and Projection:** The appendix details translating values to a common baseline year and projecting them for future periods using a damage function, which is implicitly referenced in the main text's discussion of assessing future periods.
> 
> 3. **Handling Missing Values:** Both sections mention extrapolating or filling in unknown values using similar methods.
> 
> 4. **Correlation and Double-Counting:** The main text notes accounting for double-counting and covariance, and the appendix specifies constructing matrices for these purposes.
> 
> 5. **Rapid Assessment Method and Final Steps:** Both sections refer to applying the method from Rising (2022) and constructing a final damage function.
> 
> The appendix provides more technical details and step-by-step elaboration, as expected in supplementary information, but it appears to support and expand upon the main text's summary effectively. Overall, the SI method description seems consistent with the main text's explanation, ensuring clarity and coherence between the two sections.

> \subsection{Estimation of Missing Risks from Known Risks}
> 
> To estimate the impacts of missing risks as a fraction of the known risks, we follow a systematic approach informed by prior methodologies, including that of Nordhaus (2013). The steps for this estimation are outlined below:
> 
> \begin{enumerate}
>     \item **Identification of Known Risks:** We first compile a comprehensive list of known risks from various impact channels that have been assessed in the literature. This includes sector-specific analyses that report monetary losses due to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, storms, and sea-level rise.
> 
>     \item **Selection of Models:** For each risk channel, we utilize multiple models that have been established in existing studies. This diversity allows us to capture a range of potential outcomes and uncertainties associated with each impact.
> 
>     \item **Bootstrapping Process:** We implement a bootstrapping technique to draw samples from the distribution of losses for each impact channel. Random samples are taken from the different models identified in the previous step, ensuring that each model has a chance to contribute to the final estimate of known risks.
> 
>     \item **Calculating Known Risks:** After randomly selecting models for each channel, we sum the losses to determine the total estimated economic impact of known risks. This total serves as a crucial reference point for calculating missing risks.
> 
>     \item **Estimating Missing Risks:** Following the framework provided by Nordhaus, we assume that missing risks account for 25\% of the total known risks. This multiplier is based on historical data and expert consensus regarding the extent of unaccounted risks in climate impact assessments.
> 
>     \item **Aggregation of Results:** The missing risks for each Monte Carlo run are calculated by taking 25\% of the total known risks obtained from the previous step, effectively integrating them into our overall risk assessment framework.
> 
>     \item **Analysis of Uncertainty:** We also undertake a sensitivity analysis to understand the effect of varying the 25\% assumption. By adjusting this fraction within plausible ranges, we conduct additional simulations to evaluate the robustness of our missing risks estimation and the associated uncertainties.
> 
>     \item **Projection Over Time:** Finally, we project the estimates for missing risks over the future periods under consideration (2011-2030, 2041-2060, and 2081-2100). This involves applying the same projections used for known risks while ensuring that the estimated uncertainties are appropriately reflected in the outcomes.
> \end{enumerate}
> 
> Through this approach, we derive a significant estimate of missing risks: **0.66\% GDP [0.19--1.21\%]** in the current period, which is predicted to rise to **2.06\% GDP [-0.86\% to 5.11\%]** by the end of the century. By drawing randomly from both methodologies, we enhance our understanding of the overall economic impacts of climate change and the uncertainty surrounding such estimates, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive assessment of climate risks.

> 
> To estimate the impacts of missing risks as a fraction of the known risks, we follow a systematic approach informed by methodologies, including that of Nordhaus (2013). The steps for this estimation are outlined below:
> 
> \begin{enumerate}
>     \item **Data Preparation:** We start by reading the results from a pre-compiled CSV file containing data from various impact channels. The dataset includes monetary losses associated with different climate impacts across various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
> 
>     \item **Aggregation of Known Risks:** We aggregate the monetary values for known risks by summing across different methodologies and sources, ensuring that we consider only channels that do not explicitly account for missing risks. For channels known to face potential double-counting issues, adjustments are made as described in the code. For instance, in the case of droughts, we calculate and apply a percentage reduction to account for double-counting based on historical values, adjusting the losses from those channels accordingly.
> 
>     \item **Monte Carlo Simulation Setup:** To assess the uncertainty around our estimates, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation over 1000 iterations. In each iteration, we randomly select a model for each channel by sampling from the available sources for the respective impact channels. 
> 
>     \item **Random Sampling of Channels:** For each unique impact channel, we subset the data to identify a chosen source model. We skip channels that relate to missing risks and gather contributions across the remaining channels.
> 
>     \item **Calculating Total Known Risks:** In each Monte Carlo iteration, we sum the monetary values for known risks from the selected sources. The summation is conducted for each year of interest, resulting in an aggregated dataset for each simulation run.
> 
>     \item **Estimating Missing Risks:** Following the framework provided by Nordhaus, we assume that missing risks constitute 25\% of the total estimated known risks. We compute this by taking the median for the 5th percentiles (q05), mean, and 95th percentiles (q95) for the SSP scenarios to quantify the missing risks over the future periods of interest. 
> 
>     \item **Final Aggregation:** After completing the Monte Carlo simulations, we aggregate the 1000 iterations to summarize the results. This includes taking the 5th percentile, mean, and 95th percentile across all simulations to provide a range of estimates for missing risks.
> 
>     \item **Projection Over Time:** Finally, the estimates for missing risks are projected over future periods (2011-2030, 2041-2060, and 2081-2100) to capture potential economic impacts from unaccounted risks in the context of climate change, as expressed through different SSP pathways.
> 
> \end{enumerate}
> 
> Through this approach, we derive a significant estimate of missing risks: **0.66\% GDP [0.19--1.21\%]** in the current period, which is predicted to rise to **2.06\% GDP [-0.86\% to 5.11\%]** by the end of the century. By drawing randomly from both methodologies, we enhance our understanding of the overall economic impacts of climate change and the uncertainty surrounding such estimates, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive assessment of climate risks.
