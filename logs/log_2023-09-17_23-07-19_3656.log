**user**:
> How can I add a header to a latex document. I want it to just say "Research and Teaching Statement - James Rising" centered at the top of each page.
**assistant**:
> To add a header to a LaTeX document, you can use the `fancyhdr` package. Here's an example of how you can add a centered header with the desired text:
> 
> ```latex
> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage{fancyhdr}
> 
> \pagestyle{fancy}
> \fancyhf{} % Clear default header and footer
> \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} % Remove the horizontal rule line
> 
> % Define the header content
> \chead{Research and Teaching Statement - James Rising}
> 
> \begin{document}
> % Your document content goes here
> 
> \end{document}
> ```
> 
> In this example, we load the `fancyhdr` package and set the page style to `fancy` using `\pagestyle{fancy}`. We then clear the default header and footer using `\fancyhf{}` and remove the horizontal rule line under the header with `\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}`.
> 
> Next, we define the header content using `\chead{Research and Teaching Statement - James Rising}`. The `\chead{}` command places the content centered in the header section.
> 
> You can customize the header further by adjusting font styles, sizes, or adding additional elements if desired. Remember to add your desired content and document text between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`.
> 
> Let me know if you need any further assistance!
**user**:
> For some reason, it doesn't show up on the first page.
**assistant**:
> If the header is not showing up on the first page of your LaTeX document, you can try using the `\thispagestyle{fancy}` command right after `\begin{document}`. This command overrides the default `plain` style on the first page and applies the `fancy` style, which includes your header.
> 
> Here's the modified code:
> 
> ```latex
> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage{fancyhdr}
> 
> \pagestyle{fancy}
> \fancyhf{} % Clear default header and footer
> \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} % Remove the horizontal rule line
> 
> % Define the header content
> \chead{Research and Teaching Statement - James Rising}
> 
> \begin{document}
> \thispagestyle{fancy} % Add this line to display the header on the first page
> 
> % Your document content goes here
> 
> \end{document}
> ```
> 
> By adding `\thispagestyle{fancy}` immediately after `\begin{document}`, the `fancy` page style will be applied to the first page as well.
> 
> Please give it a try and let me know if the header now appears on the first page as expected!
