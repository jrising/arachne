> In a github repository, the most recent commit should have been put on a separate branch. I've now created that new branch to point to the commit, but now I want to set the current branch (master) to point to the commit immediately prior to the current commit. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> To set your current branch (`master`) to point to the commit immediately prior to the most recent commit, you can use the `git reset` command. Here's how you can do that safely:
> 
> 1. **Ensure the Current Commit is Saved**: Since you've moved the commit to a new branch, make sure that this branch is correctly pointing to your latest commit. You can double-check with `git branch` to see which commit the branches are pointing to.
> 
> 2. **Reset the `master` Branch**:
>    - First, make sure you're on the `master` branch:  
>      ```bash
>      git checkout master
>      ```
>    - Then reset `master` to the commit immediately before the most recent one. You can do this using the `HEAD~1` notation, which refers to the commit preceding the current `HEAD`:  
>      ```bash
>      git reset --hard HEAD~1
>      ```
> 
> 3. **Verify the Reset**: You may want to check the log to ensure `master` is pointing to the correct commit:  
>    ```bash
>    git log
>    ```
> 
> **Important Considerations**:
> - Using `git reset --hard` will discard any uncommitted changes. Ensure that you've committed everything you want to save before running this command.
> - It's always a good idea to push the changes to the remote as soon as you verify everything is correct:  
>   ```bash
>   git push origin master --force
>   ```
> - If other collaborators are working on the same repository, communicate this change, as it will alter the commit history of the `master` branch.
