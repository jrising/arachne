> What is the optimization method where you can have a whole big matrix of constraints but everything needs to be linear?
**assistant**:
> The optimization method you're referring to is known as Linear Programming (LP). Linear programming is a method for optimizing a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. 
> 
> In a linear programming problem, you're looking to maximize or minimize a linear function - often called the objective function - while satisfying a set of linear constraints. 
> 
> The general form of a linear programming problem is:
> 
> ```
> Minimize: c^T * x
> 
> Subject to:
> 
> A * x <= b
> x >= 0
> ```
> Here, `c`, `A` and `b` are given vectors and matrix, and `c^T * x` is the dot product of `c` and `x`. `x` is the vector of variables (to be determined). The solution of this problem is the vector `x` that minimizes the objective function while simultaneously satisfying all the constraints.

> This mathematical technique often underlies operations research, logistics, and economic planning. Computer science also employs this method in areas like machine learning, game theory, and computer networks. Linear programming can be solved using various algorithms, the most renowned of which is the simplex method created by George Dantzig.
