**assistant**:
> There are several reasons why some individuals choose not to put nice knives in the dishwasher:
> 
> 1. **Damage to the Knife Edge**: The dishwasher's vigorous cleaning action can cause knives to knock against other utensils or the dishwasher itself, resulting in dull or damaged knife edges.
>   
> 2. **Corrosion and Rust**: Dishwashing detergents are highly alkaline. When in contact with the metal of a knife for extended periods, it can cause oxidation, resulting in discoloration and rust. High-quality stainless steel knives resist, but don't eliminate, this process.
> 
> 3. **Damage to the handle**: Many quality knives have wooden handles or fine steel/titanium handles, which can warp, crack, fade, or otherwise be damaged by the heat and moisture in a dishwasher.
> 
> 4. **Potential for Accidents**: As people are loading and unloading the dishwasher, exposed knife blades can lead to accidental injuries.
> 
> To maintain their quality and ensure long-term usage, best practice demands that knives, especially high-quality ones, should be hand-washed with mild soap, then immediately dried and stored properly.
