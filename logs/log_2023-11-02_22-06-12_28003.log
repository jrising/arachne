**user**:
> What are the major negotiating blocs present at the UNFCCC COP meetings?
**assistant**:
> There are several negotiating blocs at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings that play an important role in discussions and decisions about global climate change:
> 
> 1. **Group of 77 (G-77) and China:** This is the largest coalition of developing countries negotiating together in the UN system, not just the UNFCCC. It voices the concerns and interests of developing countries related to economic and social development and poverty eradication. Though initially had 77 countries in 1964, now has grown to 134 member nations.
> 
> 2. **Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS):** Represents 44 low-lying and small island countries that are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise. They often push for ambitious mitigation targets and strong adaptation and loss-and-damage support.
> 
> 3. **Least Developed Countries (LDC):** Countries that are especially vulnerable to climate change due to their limited capacity to respond and adapt. The LDC group focuses on both mitigation and adaptation assistance from developed nations.
> 
> 4. **African Group:** Represents the interests of 54 African countries, which are often climate vulnerable but have fewer resources to adapt. This bloc works to ensure that interests and needs of the continent are taken into account in global climate talks.
> 
> 5. **European Union (EU):** The 28 member states of the EU negotiate as a single bloc. The EU traditionally has been a strong proponent of internationally binding commitments to emissions reductions.
> 
> 6. **Umbrella Group:** A loose coalition of non-EU developed countries. It includes Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the USA. 
> 
> 7. **Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC):** A group of developing countries that work together to protect their economic growth and developmental rights including China, India, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.
> 
> 8. **Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC):** A group of progressive Latin American countries that tend to seek ambitious action to combat climate change while balancing the need for sustainable development.
> 
> 9. **Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA):** A bloc of socialist and social democratic countries advocating for an alternative to neoliberalism, valuing social justice and cooperation over competition. 
> 
> 10. **Environment Integrity Group (EIG):** A small group consisting of Switzerland, South Korea, Mexico, Liechtenstein, and Monaco which focuses on environmental integrity in the negotiations.
> 
> Please note that these groups are fluid and may shift their memberships, alliances, or names over time.
