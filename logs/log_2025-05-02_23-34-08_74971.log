> Do CGE models have static elasticities of substitution between sectors?
**assistant**:
> Yes, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models typically use static elasticities of substitution between sectors. These elasticities are parameters that are predefined and remain constant for the duration of the model run. They represent the degree to which sectors can substitute between inputs or goods. The elasticities are usually estimated based on historical data or expert judgment and are set as fixed inputs to the model, not dynamically changing during the simulation. This approach allows the model to maintain consistency and robustness in its results while simulating interactions in the economy. However, the choice of elasticities is crucial, as they significantly influence the model's outcomes.
