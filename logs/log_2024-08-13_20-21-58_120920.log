> I want to sync most of a directory from one server to another in rclone, but I have some directories that I don't need to copy. In fact, I can't copy them, since they're too big. How can I exclude them?
**assistant**:
> Sure, when using rclone, you can exclude specific directories by using the `--exclude` flag followed by a path pattern. 
> 
> You use the `**` pattern to match any sequence of characters.
> 
> For example, if you were trying to exclude a folder called `large_files` which is in the root directory of what's being synced, your command would look something like this:
> 
> ```bash
> rclone sync source:path destination:path --exclude '/large_files/**'
> ```
> The `'/large_files/**'` says to exclude a directory named `large_files` at the root level (`/` at the start indicates root level) and all of its contents (`/**` at the end indicates this).
> 
> If there were several directories to exclude, you could use multiple `--exclude` flag, like so:
> 
> ```bash
> rclone sync source:path destination:path --exclude '/large_files1/**' --exclude '/large_files2/**'
> ```
> Remember to replace `source:path` and `destination:path` with your exact source and destination paths.
> 
> Also recall to quote your patterns to prevent shell globbing. Shell globbing would process wildcards (`*` or `?`) before they get to rclone. For instance, shell globbing can interpret `*` as all files in the local directory. Quoting prevents such potential misunderstandings.

> If data privacy is a concern, especially if you are sending data over the internet, you may want to explore encrypted remote to add a layer of security. Rclone supports encryption of data.

> Do let me know if you need further assistance or additional details on this.
