> Dear James Rising,
> 
> I hope you are doing well. My name is Mahadi Amin, and I am writing to let you know that I am interested in pursuing an M.Sc. in Marine Science and Policy under your supervision.
> 
> I have been working as a research assistant in the Laboratory of Fish-ecophysiology since 2021.  I am particularly interested in the intersection of eco-physiology, toxicology, aquatic ecology, climate change, marine biology, and oceanography focusing on how environmental stressors and pollutants affect physiological processes in aquatic organisms.
> 
> I have completed my Bachelor of Science degree from the Faculty of Fisheries, graduating with a CGPA of 3.707 out of 4.00. Notably, I achieved a CGPA of 3.843 in my last four semesters. Additionally, I have completed a Duolingo score of 115, with no individual band score below 100.

> Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate change. One of your outstanding academic publications, titled ‘The missing risks of climate change’, while exploring various scholarly journals. Bangladesh faces significant climate change risks, including rising sea levels that threaten displacement and agricultural land loss. Frequent cyclones and floods disrupt infrastructure and livelihoods, while increased salinity jeopardizes food security and drinking water. The economy, heavily reliant on agriculture, could see a 2% annual GDP loss due to these impacts. Climate change is having significant impacts on fisheries around the world. With my background in Climate Change and Fisheries, Coastal Ecosystems, Oceanography, and Marine Science, I aim to contribute to research on climate change. I believe that I can provide my knowledge to conduct experiments under your supervision.

> I am eager to contribute to your ongoing research projects and am confident that under your guidance, I can further develop my skills and make meaningful contributions to the field. I would be grateful if you could consider my application for a graduate position.
> 
> I have attached my CV for your review. I would be delighted to discuss my application further and am available for an interview at your convenience.

> Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with you.

> Dear Mahadi,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your background with me. It sounds like you would be a good candidate for the Environmental Science & Management program, which includes a Marine track suitable for your interests. This program can help deepen your knowledge and provide avenues to explore the intersection of climate impacts and marine ecosystems, aligning well with your experience and aspirations.
> 
> Please note that funding within the ESM program is limited, as it is unfunded for most students. I would encourage you to apply by December 15 to be considered for any available funds. Mentioning your interest in my work on climate change risks in your statement of purpose could strengthen your application given your relevant background.
> 
> I wish you the best in your application process and hope to see you contribute significantly to the field of marine science and policy.

> Dear James Rising,
> 
> Thank you for your encouraging response and guidance. I am thrilled to hear that my background aligns well with the Environmental Science & Management program, and I will certainly highlight my interest in your work on climate change risks in my statement of purpose. I am working on preparing all the necessary documents that are required for the university admission process.
> I would like to share some additional context regarding my financial situation. As an international student from Bangladesh, I seek full funding opportunities, including research assistantships (RA) or teaching assistantships (TA), to support my studies. Securing funding is crucial for me to pursue my graduate education. Family’s financial resources are limited.
> Given my background in eco-physiology, climate change, and marine science, I am eager to explore how to contribute to your ongoing research on climate change risks and aquatic ecosystems. I believe that a conversation would provide valuable insights into aligning my research goals with your work.
> If possible, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to have a brief meeting via Zoom or Google Meet at your convenience. I am flexible with timings and can adjust to your schedule.
> Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to discussing these important topics with you.
