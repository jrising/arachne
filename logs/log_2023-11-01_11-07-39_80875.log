**assistant**:
> For your Bayesian model, if you believe your standard deviation σ should be around 0.1, a suitable light tailed informative prior could be a half-normal distribution. 
> 
> A half-normal distribution is positive-only and considered light-tailed, which might be appropriate given your situation. It's defined as `y ~ half_normal(0, 0.1)`. Here, the "0.1" is the standard deviation of the half-normal, providing light regularization around your prior belief about the location of σ.

> Alternatively, you could choose to use a Gamma distribution. In the Bayesian context, it's common to use a Gamma distribution as a conjugate prior for the variance (and hence the standard deviation) of a normal distribution. But you would need to carefully select the shape and scale parameters to reflect your belief that σ is around 0.1.

> Remember, your choice of prior should ultimately reflect your prior beliefs about the parameter you're estimating. If you believe that your guess could be off by a greater amount, it's better to employ a more heavy-tailed distribution.
