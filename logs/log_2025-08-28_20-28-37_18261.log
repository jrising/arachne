> Labor Market for Environmental Economics
> Labor Insight – Burning Glass Technologies
> To find the labor market for people with a master’s degree or PhD degree in environmental economics, this market research study used statistical data from Labor Insight and Program Insight provided by Emsi Burning Glass Technologies, which combined real-time data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and its database of labor market and education market data. Job postings from various sources are collected and analyzed by this tool to present insights based on user-defined search conditions. The results were mainly filtered using the period January 1 to December 31, 2021 and collected in the Mid-Atlantic. 
> Job postings with the specified skills of “environmental economics” or a 6-digit CIP (Classifying Instructional Programs) code 03.0204 of the ‘Environmental/Natural Resource Economics’ in Labor Insight were adopted for this research. Firstly, to understand the overall market, this research applies three conditions: environmental economics skills, master’s degree with 03.0204 CIP code or doctoral degree with 03.0204 CIP code when looking into job trend for 10 years, educational qualifications and salary analysis of each degree. After that, the job market inferred from master’s degree programs and doctoral degree programs was analyzed separately in demand by region, industry, and employer. Also, required skills and occupations are described separately. 
> To see the trend of the demand in the same job market over time, the numbers of job postings with the same skill requirements and the CIP code for the last 10 years was analyzed as well.  Annual job postings in this range used the same period of January 1 to December 31 of each year. 
> 
> Job Trends for the last 10 years
> Figure 1 shows the annual numbers of job postings that include ‘environmental economics’ job skills and are inferred from the ‘Environmental/Natural Resource Economics’ CIP code. The demand in the job market has overall increasing for 10 years in the Mid-Atlantic region, while fluctuations are found. 
> The number of jobs that were posted in 2021, from January 1 to December 31, in the Mid-Atlantic was 57,303, which has increased 1.36 times compared to 10 years ago.  
> 
> Figure 1: Annual job postings for 10 years in the Mid-Atlantic (January 1, 2012 - December 31, 2021)
> 
> 
> Educational Qualifications
> The majority of jobs out of the 57,303 job postings requiring ‘environmental economics’ skills and inferred from the ‘Environmental/Natural Resource Economics’ CIP code preferred or required either a master’s degrees or a doctoral degrees, which amounted to 22,081 and 22,154 each.
> Figure 2 shows information on both the preferred and minimum/required education levels. A job posting could be counted in more than one of the educational categories shown below. There were also 14,357 unspecified postings included in Figure 2.

> Estimated Median Salary
> Figure 3 describes Burning Glass’s estimated salaries for the job postings that request environmental economics’ skills and master’s or doctoral degrees between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 in the Mid-Atlantic region. The median salary was $71,186. The top 25% salary was expected to be $95,396 while the bottom 25% was expected to be $52,823. Burning Glass’s calculates estimated salary by using a machine learning model based on job postings every year, and accounting for adjustments by location, industry, skills, experience, education requirements, among other variables.

> Advertised Salary by Education
> Figure 6 introduces advertised salary by education levels from the job postings with environmental economics requirements. This data includes 7,614 job postings out of 57,303 describing both demanded education level and salary information. 
> The mean salary of all degrees was $71,229. By educational level, the job postings requiring master’s degree were expected to earn the average of $73,033 and doctoral degree $79,247, while candidates with bachelor’s degrees were expected to earn $75,806, which is slightly higher than master’s degree. What should be considered is that most of job postings (49,689 postings) did not advertise the salary information.

> Master’s degree in Environmental Economics
> To understand the job market for master’s degree independently, the job postings that require ‘environmental economics’ skills or are inferred from master’s degree with ‘environmental/natural resource economics’ CIP code (03.0204) were analyzed in this part. 21,842 job postings out of total 57,303 were collected. 
> 
> Job Demand by Region
> The number of jobs demanded in the Mid-Atlantic in 2021 was highest in New York State, New Jersey and Virginia. The job postings in New York were 6,334, which covered 29.0% of the total 21,842 posts. New Jersey and Virginia had 3,620 (16.6%) and 3,157 (14.5%), respectively. Similarly, there were 3,149 postings (14.4%) in Pennsylvania. Figure 7 shows demand depending on states requiring environmental economics skills specified and also inferred from master’s programs in environmental/natural resource economics. It is important to note that Delaware hired 383 jobs (1.8%) in 2021, which indicates the importance of preparing students for positions in other states in the Mid-Atlantic.     
>

> Education Market for Environmental Economics
> Overview
> This part of the research is competitive analysis of master’s degree and doctoral programs that have similar curriculum to environmental economics. The program information data was employed from the websites of comparative universities. The competitor universities’ coursework and tuition were mainly covered in this part. The tuition for students to earn the master’s degree was estimated assuming students complete the program in 2 years unless the period is not specified or the tuition is applied per credit.
> Many of universities do not have the degree program with the title of ‘environment’ and ‘economics’ simultaneously. The similar programs are introduced in this research. 
> Duke University, Bren School of University of California Santa Barbara, University of Washington, University of Miami, University of Rhode Island, and University of Maine were chosen as primary competitors by the School of Marine Science and Policy of University of Delaware. University of California San Diego that was recommended was excluded because the programs had less relation to the environment economics. 
> Additionally, this research studied conferral market share data on the CIP code of 03.0204: Environmental/Natural Resource Economics from Program Insight by Burning Glass. Tuskegee University and West Virginia University were included with the highest conferral market share in 2021 nationwide. 
> In master’s degree conferral market share, University of Delaware ranked the first with 57.14% market share last year. Following University of Delaware, Tuskegee University’s market share was 28.57% and West Virginia University had 14.29% of market share. In doctoral conferral market, West Virginia University conferred almost 100% degree in 2021. 
> 
> Master’s degree 
> School of Marine Science and Policy in University of Delaware plans to focus on professional coursework with master’s degree by providing the students with a second year capstone experience associated with outside agency. This research included the hands-on experience of competitive schools as well as overall curriculum.
> 
> Duke University
> Nicholas School of the Environment of Duke University has 10 master’s degree programs. The Master of Environment Management (MEM) and the Duke Environmental Leadership Master of Environmental Management (DEL-MEM) programs are including economics courses and dealing with overall environmental studies such as earth, ocean. 
> The MEM students are supposed to choose one of seven specialized programs, the focal points of which are ‘Business & Environment’, ‘Coastal Environmental Management’, ‘Ecosystem Science & Conservation’, ‘Ecotoxicology & Environmental Health’, ‘Energy & Environment’, ‘Environmental Economics & Policy’ and ‘Water Resources Management’. Six of these programs recommend students to study two courses of microeconomics as additional prerequisites, which are ‘Resource & Environmental Economics’. Also, the students in 4 programs should necessarily take 3 credits of economics core courses. These programs are ‘Business & Environment’, ‘Coastal Environmental Management’, ‘Ecosystem Science & Conservation’, and ‘‘Environmental Economics & Policy’. The MEM program requires students to complete 48 credits for 2 years (1-3 years), 4 semesters. The requirements include 4-7 credit basic requirements for all MEM students, which consist of one seminar and Master’s Project, and coursework depending on individual’s specialized program area. 
> For the master’s project, students have two options, Two-Semester Master’s Project (2S MP) and Three-Semester Master’s Project (3S MP). The 2S MP is a nine-month multidisciplinary collaboration between an external partner, a small team (2-5) of master’s students, and a faculty advisor. The 3S MP is designed for the students who seek an original or applied research experience and the topic can occasionally involve an external partner. 
> The DEL-MEM is online program and designed for students to tackle real-life professional cases and to be trained in-depth in 2 years. ‘Economics of Environmental Management’ course is required for the student to earn. 
> The flat tuitions and fees are applied by academic year covering 9 to 15 credits per semester. MEM flat tuition without fees for 2021-2022 academic year is $42,860 and DEL-MEM tuition is $41,620. Part-time tuition for the student who enrolls fewer than 9 credits is $1,860/credit.

> Bren School of University of California Santa Barbara
> Bren School of UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) offers Master of Environmental Science and Management (MESM) degree program, which is intended for students to develop solutions to environmental problems. To earn the degree, students should complete 30 units of 8 core courses, 36 units of specialization courses and 14 units of master’s group project or eco-entrepreneurship project. Students can choose their specialization during Winter Quarter of the first year, where economics-related specialization is included. These specializations are ‘Coastal Marine Resources Management’, ‘Conservation Planning’, ‘Corporate Environmental Management’, ‘Economics and Politics of the Environment’, ‘Energy and Climate’, ‘Pollution Prevention and Remediation’ and ‘Water Resources Management’. To complete Economics and Politics of the Environment specialization, the students are required to earn 8 units in economics courses. The economics courses that students can choose are ‘Economics and Policy of Climate Change (4 units)’, ‘Natural Resource Economics (4 units)’ and ‘Cost Benefit Analysis (4 units)’.
> The MESM is 2 year program consisting of 6 quarters. The tuition for a quarter is $4,190/quarter. Non-resident students should pay non-resident tuition, $4,082 per year. The non-resident student may be waived non-resident tuition after year 1 when the residency is established.

> Cost Analysis
> The total tuitions for full-time student to earn the degree of each university were estimated to compare on the same basis. Additional fees were excluded. It was assumed that students complete the program in 2 years unless the period is not specified or the tuition is applied per credit. In the case of University of Rhode Island, MS in EEC with non-thesis option was applied to see the higher cost. 
> The tuition of MEM degree in Duke University is the highest for in-state students as out-of-state students as $85,702. The lowest total tuition is found in West Virginia University’s on-campus program with $8,982. The tuition of University of Delaware is $950/credit. With the assumption that the credit requirement is 40, the total tuition for the master’s degree would be $38,000. University of Delaware positions in the middle level in terms of cost.

> Debt-to-Salary ratio for master’s degree
> The debt-to-salary ratio for all the comparative universities is calculated making the following assumptions:
> Median salary for an employee with master’s degree according to the data provided by Labor Insight tool is $73,200.
> The median salary is the incremental salary earned after the environmental economics master’s degree program.
> A student borrowed the entire tuition fee for a year and the other fees were excluded in the debt.
> No interest rates were applied. 
> No financial aid was provided by the universities.
> Figure 19 shows the students who complete the MEM degree program in Duke University would have the highest debt-to-salary ratio with 117%. This means that they would have $1.17 in debt for every $1 of their salary when they complete the program and start to receive their salary. Seeing University of Delaware, the students who earn the master’s degree would have $0.52 debt per $1.

> Key Findings
> In the past 12 months, there were 57,303 job openings requiring environmental economics skills and inferred from degree programs in environmental/natural resource economics in the Mid-Atlantic region. The demand has increased steadily for 10 years. 
> The estimated median salary of those job positions was $71,186. Looking into the medians by work experience, the employees with 0 to 2 years’ experience are expected to earn $59,900 of median salary, 3 to 5 around $73,000 and 6 to 8 years around $89,400. At highest, the median salary of the employees with more than 9 years is estimated as $95,300.
> The estimated median salaries depending on the education level are $72,500 with bachelor’s degree, $73,300 for the employees with master’s degree and $77,000 for doctoral degree holder.
> Taking a view of job industries for the holders of a master’s degree and a doctoral degree separately, colleges, universities, and professional schools industry was the first demanding industry for both master’s degree and doctoral. However, there was much higher demand for doctoral degree. 75.1% of job postings for doctoral degree were generated from the colleges, universities, and professional schools industry was the first demanding industry, while 10.7% of job posting that require master’s degree were created. Consequently, there were around 74% of job postings hiring college professor/instructor. 
> Looking at the postings related to master’s degree, the second demanding industry was pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing with 8.5% proportion and the third was depository credit intermediation. The most occupation type that specified master’s degree was compliance manager, social science researcher and regularly affairs specialist. 
> Economist was the fifth-ranked occupation for master’s degree and the fourth for doctoral degree. The LQ that present how concentrated demand is in a particular geography was very high with both degrees. It means there are relatively higher quotients of environmental economists in the Mid-Atlantic region.
> The top employer that hired master’s degree holders last year was Anthem Blue Cross, Johnson & Johnson, Citi, Guidehouse, JP Morgan Chase Company, US Government and Amazon. The employers that required doctoral degree were mostly universities such as University of Pennsylvania, SUNY, Rutgers, PSU and University of Maryland.
> In comparative analysis, this research studied 8 universities for master’s degree and 4 universities for doctoral degree. There were few programs directly related to environmental economics. Duke University, Bren School of UC Santa Barbara, University of Washington, University of Miami are offering master’s program that focus on environmental studies and provide environmental economics courses or specializations. University of Rhode Island, University of Maine, Tuskegee University and West Virginia University are providing master’s degree program directing ‘environmental’ and ‘economics’ with a large number of related classes, the titles of which are MS in Environmental and Natural Resource Economics (EEC), MS in Resource Economics and Policy, MS in Agricultural and Resource Economics, and MS in Resource Economics and Management (REM). 
> Two online master’s degree programs were found in Duke University and West Virginia University. West Virginia University is offering the MS in Resource Economics and Management in two different way of attendance, on-campus and online respectively.  
> Bren School of UC Santa Barbara requires the largest number of credits for students to earn the degree, which were 80 credits. The credit requirements of the comparator universities were between 30 to 80 and mostly achievable within 2 years. 
> The tuition of MEM degree in Duke University is the highest for in-state students as out-of-state students as $85,702. The lowest total tuition is found in West Virginia University’s on-campus program with $8,982. The students who complete the MEM degree program in Duke University would have the highest debt-to-salary ratio with 117%. This means that they would have $1.17 in debt for every $1 of their salary when they complete the program and start to receive their salary.
> The University of Delaware are assumed that they will require 40 credits for student to earn the master’s degree and tuition will be $950/credit. Based on that assumption, the debt-to-salary ration is expected to be 52%, $0.52 debt for $1. It would be on the middle level amongst the comparator universities.

**user**:
> Great. Now, I also have an example 4+1 policy document for a public policy Masters, and it shows how to write this section. It reads:
> ===
> Nationally, graduates from public policy programs at the masters levels have risen steadily  between the 2000-01 academic year through 2012-13, before leveling off somewhat (see Figure  1).1 These degrees are known for providing interdisciplinary perspective and flexible career  possibilities in the public, non-profit, and private sector. 
> Economics provides specific critical thinking skills, including applying theoretical models to  real-world phenomenon, formulate hypotheses about human behavior, and explain factors that  social phenomena. With increased demand by employers for individuals who can analyze the growing amounts of available data, more students are attracted to this major. Economics majors  tend to be interested in analyzing and evaluating social policy and enter careers in the public,  private, and non-profit sector. On October 9, 2020, the faculty of the Department of Economics in  September 2020 agreed to support the BS-ECON-MPP for Economics majors. 
> 
> Encouraging further growth in the Master in Public Policy (MPP) degree completions is an  important consideration for UD, as stated in the most recent strategic plan. The Biden School first began to offer the MPP in 2019, building on its historic strength of the Master in Public  Administration (MPA) program. With a first class of two students in Fall 2019 and seven  students enrolled in Fall 2020, applications and enrollments are growing steadily. 
> The Biden School currently offers a 4+1 program for the MPP with the undergraduate BA in  Public Policy. The Biden School has seen steady demand for 4+1 programs. Given the interest  in the Public Policy major and minor, the Biden School believes there is latent demand for  interdisciplinary public policy education among UD undergraduate students. Furthermore, the  Lerner College of Business and Economics no longer offers a M.A. in Economics, which was a  degree program that attracted talented undergraduates interested in a professional research career rather than an eventual doctoral degree. By offering the BS-ECON-MPP, we anticipate  providing a path for UD undergraduates to complete their master's degree at the Biden School and begin a professional career in policy research.
> ===
> 
> Can you write an equivalent section for this new 4+1?
**assistant**:
> Sure! Here’s a tailored section for the "Student Demand" part of the 4+1 program policy document for the Master's in Environmental Economics:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Student Demand
> 
> Nationally, the demand for graduates with Master's degrees in Environmental Economics has risen significantly over the past decade, corresponding with increased awareness of sustainability and climate-related issues. This trend highlights the importance of interdisciplinary education that combines economics with environmental studies, facilitating diverse career opportunities in public, private, and non-profit sectors.
> 
> Environmental Economics equips students with essential analytical skills, enabling them to apply theoretical frameworks to address real-world challenges related to environmental sustainability and resource management. As the job market increasingly favors individuals capable of using data to inform economic and ecological decisions, interest in economics and related fields has surged. Economics majors are notably inclined to critically assess environmental policies, contributing to roles focused on compliance, sustainability, and environmental planning.
> 
> The University of Delaware (UD) aims to foster growth in the Master's in Environmental Economics (MSEE) program, aligning with its strategic objectives for sustainability education and career readiness. As environmental concerns take center stage globally, demand for skilled professionals is expected to continue rising. 
> 
> Currently, UD offers a 4+1 program with the undergraduate Economics BS, reflecting a strong need for advanced training in this area. The integration of a Master's in Environmental Economics will streamline pathways for undergraduate students to complete their degrees efficiently and position them for impactful careers in environmental policy analysis and management. 
> 
> Given the increasing interest in sustainability and environmental issues among UD students, there is considerable latent demand for this program. This initiative not only addresses the evolving job market but also positions UD as a leader in interdisciplinary environmental education.
