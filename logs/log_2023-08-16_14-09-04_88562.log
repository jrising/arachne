> I have a particular IP address bound to my computer, which connects to the internet through wifi. The IP is known to both the router and the computer. However, every time I restart my computer, it fails to connect to the wifi. The solution for this is to tell my router to temporarily unbind that IP address, then the computer can connect (it selects the IP address it knows it should have), and then I re-bind it within the router. But I must have my setup wrong, since it can't connect initially. What is wrong?

> It appears you're using a static IP address binding between the WiFi router and your computer. In this scenario, the IP address assigned to your computer doesn't change and is always the same. That is usually a good thing, but can cause connection issues if not configured properly.
> 
> When you restart your computer, it initiates a process known as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to get an IP address. If the router has already bound the required IP to your device's MAC address, and the router's DHCP server is not correctly configured to understand this, the router might refuse the connection, causing the issue you're seeing.
> 
> One solution could be adjusting how DHCP is handled in your router settings. Here are a few things you could try:
> 
> 1. **Reservation Instead of Binding:** Instead of manually binding the IP to your computer within the router settings, use a feature usually referred to as DHCP Reservation. This allows the router's DHCP server to assign the desired IP address to your computer, but it's still dynamically controlled by the DHCP function.
> 
> 2. **DHCP Range:** Ensure that the static IP you're assigning to your computer isn't within the router's dynamic DHCP IP address range. For example, if the DHCP range is from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.100, make sure your static IP is outside this range, like 192.168.1.101.

> 3. **MAC Address Check:** Make sure the MAC address bound in the router is correct. If your computer has more than one network adapter (like Ethernet and Wi-Fi), they will have different MAC addresses.
> 
> 4. **Renew Lease:** You can try manually releasing and renewing your computer's IP address lease. In Windows, you can do this via the command prompt with `ipconfig /release` followed by `ipconfig /renew`.

> Remember that router settings can change a bit depending on the manufacturer and model. If you need help navigating these, I can give more specific guidance with additional information about your router. 
> 
> Remember to always take care when changing your network settings. It's easy to accidentally disconnect other devices or lock yourself out of the router. Save or write down your current settings somewhere safe before making any changes. If you're not comfortable making these changes yourself, it might be best to consult with a professional.
