> I saw that my application was rejected from admissions. Can anyone share with me the reasoning, and whether or not it's possible to appeal the decision? I'm really serious about environmental economics, and I truly believe that the program at University of Delaware would be a great fit for me especially as I'm interested in the work being done by faculty like Dr. James Rising on larval dispersion of fishes. It's such a cool topic that I want to learn more about and build on. I imagine there are parallels to dispersion of other biological groups like that of insects and crops.

> I was especially hoping to bring in insights on other aspects of fish population studies like using neural networks to analyze fish stocks in different countries. Another topic that interests me is that as Dr. Rising's work shows how fishes are a common resource, I am curious about international trade and development when two or more countries share a common pool of resource.

> For example, since Bangladesh and Indonesia have access to the Indian Ocean, how should they trade with each other given migratory and breeding patterns of fishes? Does it make sense to check for comparative advantage in fish stocks, or should their trade focus on other resources that are not so commonly shared? How does that relate to common pools between U.S. and Canada, or U.S. and Mexico?

University of Delaware would be an amazing place for me especially since I can also take courses in other departments like marine biology to supplement my core coursework.

I especially want to eventually advance to the PhD. I have always enjoyed research and am willing to do whatever it takes to prove that I can contribute significantly to the fields at hand.

> Dear Fattah,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your application to the Environmental Economics program at the University of Delaware. I understand your disappointment and appreciate your enthusiasm for the field and the work being done at our institution.
> 
> Unfortunately, due to limited funding, we were only able to accept a very small number of students this year. While we read your application with interest, particularly your passion for integrating insights from neural networks and international trade in fishery studies, your GPA did not meet our admissions requirements.
> 
> I encourage you to continue pursuing your interests in environmental economics and consider steps that might strengthen a future application, such as improving your academic record through additional coursework. If you would like to discuss your application or future opportunities further, please feel free to schedule a Zoom meeting with me at your convenience: [Schedule a Meeting](https://zcal.co/i/SoJjSjU0).

> Thank you again for your interest and best of luck with all your future endeavors.
