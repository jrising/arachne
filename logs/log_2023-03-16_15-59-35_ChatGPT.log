**assistant**:
> When you have a quote within a quote within a quote, the proper use of quotation marks depends on the level of the quote. Each level of the quote should be enclosed in quotation marks, and the quotation marks should alternate between double and single quotation marks to differentiate between each level of the quote.
> 
> Here's an example to illustrate:
> 
> Original text: 
> John said, "Samantha told me, 'Mike said, "I can't make it to the party."'"
> 
> In this example, there are three levels of quotes. The outermost level is the statement made by John, which is enclosed in double quotation marks. The second level is the quote within John's statement, which is enclosed in single quotation marks. The innermost level is the quote within the quote, which is enclosed in double quotation marks.
> 
> Another example:
> 
> Original text: 
> Sarah asked, "Did Tom say, 'I'll be there at 2:00 p.m.' or did he say, 'I'll be there at 3:00 p.m.'?"
> 
> In this example, there are also three levels of quotes. The outermost level is the question asked by Sarah, which is enclosed in double quotation marks. The second level is the quote within Sarah's question, which is enclosed in single quotation marks. The innermost level is the second quote within the question, which is also enclosed in single quotation marks.
> 
> Remember to be consistent with your use of quotation marks, and always make sure to close each level of the quote properly.
