> I have a QNAP NAS, and I want to mount it on my lab's linux server. I have followed some instructions to mount it under NFS, but it still comes in as read-only. Specifically, any write operations say, "Read-only file system". Can I make it read/write for all users on my linux server?
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you're encountering a common issue with NFS mounts related to permissions. Here are steps to help ensure your QNAP NAS is mounted with read/write permissions:
> 
> 1. **Check Export Permissions on QNAP NAS:**
>    - Log into your QNAP NAS and navigate to the "Control Panel."
>    - Under "Privilege Settings," select "Shared Folders" and find the folder you're trying to mount.
>    - Click "Edit" for the shared folder and go to the "NFS Host Access" tab.
>    - Ensure the "Access right" is set to "Read/Write" for the IP address of your lab's Linux server. You might need to add an entry if itâ€™s not already listed.
>    - Make sure to allow the "Root Access" if required.
> 
> 2. **Check the NFS Export Options:**
>    - On your QNAP, the NFS export options should be something like `rw,sync,no_root_squash`. You can usually see these settings in the same NFS Host Access menu.
> 
> 3. **Mount with Correct Options on Linux:**
>    - On your Linux server, update the `/etc/fstab` (if you are using it for persistent mounts) or the `mount` command used to ensure the mount options include `rw`.
>    - An example of a line in your `/etc/fstab` could look like:
> 
>      ```
>      [NAS-IP]:/path/to/nfs/share /mnt/mountpoint nfs defaults,rw,_netdev 0 0
>      ```
> 
>    - Or as a command, it would look like:
> 
>      ```bash
>      sudo mount -t nfs -o rw [NAS-IP]:/path/to/nfs/share /mnt/mountpoint
>      ```
> 
> 4. **Verify Linux Side Permissions:**
>    - Once mounted, verify that the user permissions on the Linux side allow writes. You can check this with:
> 
>      ```bash
>      ls -ld /mnt/mountpoint
>      ```
> 
>    - Adjust permissions with `chmod` or ownership with `chown` if necessary, though note that NFS respects NAS-side permissions.
> 
> 5. **Check Network and Firewall Settings:**
>    - Ensure that any firewall on your Linux server allows NFS traffic.
>    - If you have a UFW firewall, you might need to allow NFS through it with:
> 
>      ```bash
>      sudo ufw allow from [NAS-IP] to any port nfs
>      ```
> 
> Give these steps a try and let me know if the issue persists!
