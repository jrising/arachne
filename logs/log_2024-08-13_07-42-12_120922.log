**assistant**:
> Based on the output you've provided, it appears MongoDB is failing to start due to an error coded as "status=14". 
> 
> This could indicate a potential issue with either the MongoDB configuration file (`/etc/mongod.conf`) or that there could be issues with file permissions, an issue with storage path, or the amount of space available for MongoDB to operate.
> 
> Here are a few steps to troubleshoot:
> 
> 1. **Test Configuration File:** There might be issues with your MongoDB configuration file (`/etc/mongod.conf`). Run MongoDB without using the configuration file to see if the issue persists:
> 
> ```bash
> /usr/bin/mongod
> ```
> 
> If MongoDB starts without error, it's likely your configuration file (/etc/mongod.conf) has errors. You might want to check MongoDB logs for more details on the issue.
> 
> 2. **Check MongoDB Logs:** The MongoDB error log file usually records detailed information about why MongoDB is failing to start. You can usually find it in `/var/log/mongodb/`. Remember to replace `mongodb` with the correct path if it's different on your server.
> 
> ```bash
> cat /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
> ```
> 
> Look at the last entries in the log file to see if there are any error messages or other clues about what might be going wrong.
> 
> 3. **File Permissions and Storage Path:** Check the storage path defined in your `mongod.conf` file. Make sure that MongoDB has permissions to read and write to this directory. 
> 
> ```bash
> ls -ld /path/to/your/db
> ls -l /path/to/your/db
> ```
> 
> Replace `/path/to/your/db` with the actual path. The output of these commands will show you the permissions and ownership of the files.
> 
> 4. **Storage Space:** Check that you have an adequate amount of space available in the storage path MongoDB is using:
> 
> ```bash
> df -h /path/to/your/db
> ```
> 
> Remember to replace `/path/to/your/db` with your actual path.
> 
> Try these potential solutions and let me know if they help resolve the issue. I'm here to help further if needed!
