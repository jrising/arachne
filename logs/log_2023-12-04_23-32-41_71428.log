**user**:
> I am looking for suggestions for the title of my talk giving an overview of my research. Here is a brief summary of my work:
> ---
> I am an environmental economist and interdisciplinary computational
> modeler specializing in climate change impacts and the
> water-energy-food nexus. Drawing upon quantitative techniques from
> multiple fields, I develop systems perspectives to improve the
> management of complex social-environmental systems under global
> environmental change. I firmly believe that integrating multiple
> disciplines is essential for sustainable development, and I regularly
> collaborate with climate scientists, hydrologists, process-based
> modelers, data scientists, political economists, and
> macroeconomists. In recent years, I have connected my research to
> multiple policy contexts, and my research, teaching, and service have
> intertwined.
> 
> I have written or contributed to 26 published articles. I am the first
> or sole author on 9 of these, 2 where led by students, and the
> remaining 15 were collaborations. Additionally, I produced five public
> reports, three as lead author.
> 
> While broad in scope, my research converges around two central themes,
> providing insights that have evolved across multiple papers and
> projects.  My long-term research goals are to improve our
> understanding of appropriate actions under environmental uncertainty
> by drawing together models and modeling approaches across multiple
> disciplines. I am particularly interested in the vulnerable
> communities involved food production under climate change. By better
> understanding coupled human-natural systems, my work aims at helping
> policy-makers develop detailed transition pathways that ensure
> economic and environmental sustainability.
> ---
> 
> I have further categorized the research I want to talk about into the following groups:
>  - Interdisc. perspective
>  - Climate change: general
>  - Climate change: food
>  - Water-related
>  - Marine work
>  - IAM work
>  - Other
> 
> What would be some good talk titles?
