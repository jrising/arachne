> Hello Austin! Well, most houses made of brick are found in places where clay and sand, the main materials needed to make bricks, are abundant like the Midwestern United States, the United Kingdom, and parts of Europe. They're really strong and safe - just like the house the third little piggy built to keep the big bad wolf away in the Three Little Pigs story! Do remember that one? What other stories do you like where a house is important?

> Yes, the construction of houses using bricks continues to this day, particularly in regions where brick is readily available and has a long-standing tradition. Brick houses are still popular for several reasons. 
> 
> First, bricks are durable and provide excellent structural integrity. They can withstand harsh weather conditions, including heavy winds and earthquakes, making them a reliable choice for building homes.
> 
> Second, brick houses offer excellent insulation properties. The thermal mass of bricks helps regulate indoor temperatures, keeping the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter. This can contribute to energy efficiency and lower heating and cooling costs.
> 
> Furthermore, brick houses are appreciated for their aesthetic appeal. Many people find the appearance of brick to be timeless, elegant, and charming, providing a classic and traditional look to homes.
> 
> However, it's worth noting that brick construction may vary in popularity across different regions and cultures. Advancements in construction materials and techniques have provided alternative options, such as concrete and steel, which are also widely used in modern construction. Nonetheless, brick houses continue to be built and cherished by many people worldwide.
