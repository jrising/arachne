> ---
> How does healthy nutrition depend upon a healthy environment? This project investigates how climate change could undermine human health, through its impacts on food produced on land and in the ocean. Building upon established relationships with stakeholders in West Africa (Senegal and Nigeria), we will identify health risks for vulnerable populations, particularly small-holder farmers and fishers.
> 
> This work is grounded in a careful mapping of the consequences of climate change on agriculture (NASRDA partner) and fisheries (IMR and CRODT partners), along with their supporting ecosystem services and critical economic, social and health impacts on human populations (UD partner). We will expand the understanding of the impacts of extreme weather, elevated CO2, soil fertility and fertilization on crop production and nutrition; the role of ocean warming, deoxygenation and acidification, and degraded habitats on fisheries harvesting and nutrition; and the consequences to the local and national food security, nutrition, poverty reduction, and achievement of the SDGs. Building on this work, we will investigate how changes in food provision can threaten human health. Food scarcity, due to crop failure and weakened fisheries, can lead to malnutrition; foods deficient in essential nutrients like protein, zinc, and iron can lead to nutrient deficiency; and increased harmful algal blooms can result in shellfish poisoning.
> 
> We will co-create tools and relevant datasets that support stakeholders in developing better resilience to production, nutrition and health risks. We will analyze, describe and report the chain of dependencies between climate change, the environment, economies of food production and food provision, and human health into a Food Security Futures Explorer, including mitigation, risk management and adaptation policy options.
> 
> We will provide an actionable understanding of the dependencies between (1) climate change, (2) ecosystem services and habitat integrity, (3) agriculture and fishery production, (4) nutritious food provision through the food system, and (5) outcomes for human health. Our case studies are Senegal and Nigeria. We will first design theoretical and empirical bioeconomic models to study (1) – (3); second, analyze econometrically the consumption of staple crops and fish and the nutrient composition of food in local communities and how it is met by the supply; and third, deduce the effects on their health.
> 
> Existing research suggests climate-driven losses to agricultural production for staple crops across the developing world, and to marine ecosystems by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean, affecting reproduction and distribution of fish stocks, and fishery harvest productivity. We will investigate the role of the ecosystem services in supporting food production. Agriculture depends on ecosystems for soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification, while fisheries need water quality, biodiversity, and balanced food webs.
> 
> The actions of farmers and fishers can also undermine environmental sustainability, particularly as global environmental change disrupts their long-standing management practices. To address producer behaviors and co-develop new adaptation practices, we will apply decision-science approaches to account for economic benefits and sustainable yields, considering climate change events, costs and benefits of mitigating, adapting and migrating, and social equity goals. We will determine to what degree small-holders involved in food production are critical to food security and nutrition, health, livelihoods, and local and national economies; and how they will be affected by climate change. Our Food Security Futures Explorer will contain extensive information about adverse environmental changes to serve as an early warning system and for evaluating stakeholder adaptation options.

> In designing these WPs, consider that we need stakeholders involved in the research plan, not just dissemination. And I think that the bioeconomic modeling will be inseparable from the agriculture and fisheries production. Also, I think that the food security futures explorer is going to be the main tool outcome.
