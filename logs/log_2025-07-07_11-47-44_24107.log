**user**:
> How can I extract just the alphanumeric and space characters in a string in python? So, going from "Testin' Th(is/ese)" to "TESTIN THISESE"?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this using regular expressions in Python. By using the `re` module, you can filter out unwanted characters and then ensure the result is in uppercase. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```python
> import re
> 
> def extract_alphanumeric_and_spaces(s):
>     # Using regex to find all alphanumeric characters and spaces
>     result = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9\s]', '', s)
>     # Convert to uppercase
>     return result.upper()
> 
> input_string = "Testin' Th(is/ese)"
> output_string = extract_alphanumeric_and_spaces(input_string)
> print(output_string)  # Output: 'TESTIN THISESE'
> ```
> 
> This code will keep only alphanumeric characters and spaces, remove any punctuation or special characters, and then convert the string to uppercase.
