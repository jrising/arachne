**assistant**:
> The issue arises because the `Connection` object from SQLAlchemy's `engine.connect()` does not have a `query` method. Instead, you should use a `Session` for query operations.
> 
> Here's how you can do it using a `Session`:
> 
> 1. First, ensure you have the necessary imports:
> 
>     ```python
>     from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
>     from sqlalchemy import create_engine
>     ```
> 
> 2. Create an engine and a session:
> 
>     ```python
>     engine = create_engine('your_database_url_here')
>     Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
>     session = Session()
>     ```
> 
> 3. Use the session to query the record by id:
> 
>     ```python
>     record = session.query(items).get(id)
>     ```
> 
> 4. Don't forget to close the session after you're done with the querying:
> 
>     ```python
>     session.close()
>     ```
> 
> Putting it all together, it should look like this:
> 
> ```python
> from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
> from your_module import your_items_model # Adjust the import to reflect your actual model and module setup
> 
> engine = create_engine('your_database_url_here')
> Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
> 
> with Session() as session:
>     record = session.query(your_items_model).get(id)
> ```
> 
> Make sure to replace `'your_database_url_here'` with your actual database URL and `your_items_model` with your actual model name.
> 
> Note: SQLAlchemy 1.4 introduced the use of `select` and `scalar_one_or_none` methods as a modern approach, thus your code can also be modernized like this:
> 
> ```python
> from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
> from sqlalchemy import create_engine, select
> from your_module import your_items_model
> 
> engine = create_engine('your_database_url_here')
> Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
> 
> with Session() as session:
>     stmt = select(your_items_model).where(your_items_model.id == id)
>     record = session.execute(stmt).scalar_one_or_none()
> ```
**user**:
> Why does connection not have query, but it does have execute, which I've used, e.g., to say result = conn.execute(select(items))?
**assistant**:
> In SQLAlchemy, the `Connection` object indeed has an `execute()` method for executing SQL statements directly, but it doesn't have a `query` method for querying ORM (Object Relational Mapping) entities directly.
> 
> When you use `conn.execute(select(items))`, you are executing a raw SQL statement using the connection directly. This is useful when you need to perform raw SQL queries that don't involve ORM entities.
> 
> On the other hand, when working with ORM entities (like querying by id), you typically interact with a `Session` object instead of the `Connection` object. The `Session` object handles the ORM-related operations like querying, adding, updating, and deleting ORM-mapped objects.
> 
> When you call `session.query(your_items_model).get(id)`, you are using the ORM query API provided by the `Session` object to retrieve an ORM entity by its primary key. This abstraction allows you to work with ORM entities in a more Pythonic, object-oriented way rather than directly writing SQL queries.
> 
> So, to summarize:
> 
> - Use `execute()` with `Connection` for executing raw SQL statements directly.
> - Use the ORM query API provided by the `Session` object for interacting with ORM entities in a more object-oriented manner.
