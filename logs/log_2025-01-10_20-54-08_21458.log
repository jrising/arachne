**assistant**:
> The Andromeda Galaxy is indeed on a collision course with the Milky Way. This event is predicted to occur in about 4.5 billion years. While "collision" might sound catastrophic, it's more likely to be a graceful merging process, given the vast distances between stars within galaxies. It's expected that the stars within each galaxy will largely pass by one another without direct collisions. Ultimately, the merger will form a new elliptical galaxy sometimes nicknamed "Milkomeda."
