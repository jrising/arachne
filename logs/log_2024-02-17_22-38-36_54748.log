> My wife got unemployment payments this year. Now I'm doing taxes, and it looks like I owe a third of that back in taxes. Is that for real?
**assistant**:
> Unemployment benefits are indeed considered taxable income by the IRS. Depending on the state you live in, they may also be subject to state income tax. Here's the breakdown:
> 
> 1. **Federal Taxes:** The federal government considers unemployment benefits as income, and thus, it is subject to federal income tax. This means as you're calculating your gross income for the year, you'll need to include any unemployment compensation received. Depending on the other aspects of your income and tax situation, this could indeed result in seeming like you owe a significant portion of those benefits back in taxes. Remember, the higher your income, the higher your tax bracket may be. 
> 
> 2. **State Taxes:** Each state sets their own rules for how unemployment benefits are taxed. Some states, like California and Virginia, do not tax unemployment benefits at all. Others do. You'll need to check the rules for your specific state to know for sure.
> 
> For 2020, the federal government did provide a tax break on the first $10,200 of unemployment benefits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the benefits were received in 2023 or 2024, this specific relief measure likely doesn't apply (though it's wise to check for new regulations).
> 
> It's also worth mentioning that if someone chose not to have taxes withheld from their unemployment benefits when they initially signed up (in many states, this is an option), it may seem like they owe a lot more at tax time.
> 
> In any case, I would highly recommend consulting a tax professional or using tax software to assist with your filing, to ensure you're understanding and applying all relevant laws and deductions properly.
