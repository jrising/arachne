> I have a dataset that looks like this:

> "34","parts","1","1"

> Then, I have a larger ordered vocabulary. I want to get out a vector for every word in the vocabulary the number in the `count` column, if that term exists in the `token` column, and 0 otherwise. How can I efficiently do this? I'm working in python.
**assistant**:
> If you're working with a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `merge()` function to join your dataset with the vocabulary. We will consider `df` as your main dataset and `vocab_df` as your vocabulary DataFrame.
> 
> Here's how this could work:
> 
> ```python
> import pandas as pd
> 
> # assuming df is your main DataFrame and df_vocab is your vocabulary DataFrame
> df['token'] = df['token'].astype(str)
> df['count'] = df['count'].astype(int)
> 
> df_vocab = pd.DataFrame(vocabulary, columns=['token'])  # Assuming vocabulary is a list contains vocab words
> df_vocab['token'] = df_vocab['token'].astype(str)
> 
> df_merged = pd.merge(df_vocab, df[['token','count']], on="token", how="left")
> df_merged['count'] = df_merged['count'].fillna(0)
> df_merged['count'] = df_merged['count'].astype(int)  # Optional, if you want 'count' column in integer form
> 
> vector = df_merged['count'].values
> ```
> 
> In these steps, we are converting all the tokens in your main DataFrame and vocabulary DataFrame to match the same type, then using `merge()` to join them based on the 'token' column. The `how='left'` argument ensures that all the vocabulary words are included even if they do not exist in the DataFrame. We then fill any NaN values in the 'count' column with 0, and finally extract the 'count' column as a vector.
