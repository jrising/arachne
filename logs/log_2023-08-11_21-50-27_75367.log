> I previously asked for some information extracted from a document:
> ---
> Activity Name: Recreational Fishing
> 
> Description: Recreational fishing involves private boaters and fishing charters. These activities take place in specific areas which can potentially conflict with proposed wind turbine installations.
> 
> Current Status: Ongoing activity with potential for space-use conflicts with offshore wind development.
> 
> Spatial Extent: The section mentions data in “10-minute grid cells” but not the specific zones or scale of the area. The area would need to be identified on Map 42 (not provided).
> 
> Temporal Pattern: The report does not specify distinct temporal patterns.
> 
> Potential Expansion/Changes: If recreational fishing is excluded from wind project areas, conflicts may arise if turbines are installed in commonly fished areas. However, wind projects might also serve as artificial reefs, attracting more fish and possibly stimulating the recreational fishing industry.
> 
> Stakeholders: Recreational fishers (both charter and private), offshore wind developers, resource managers.
> 
> Sources: Data obtained from NOAA-NMFS (2006-2010), Captain Seagull’s Fishing Maps, NOAA Nautical Charts.
> 
> Other Notes: Fishing areas should not be considered comprehensive, due to confidentiality restrictions and variability in where fishers choose to fish.
> 
> Activity Name: Sand Borrow Locations
> 
> Description: Areas used by the USACE for sand replenishment to combat beach erosion. These sites involve active dredging operations.
> 
> Current Status: Ongoing activity with known locations and potential locations identified.
> 
> Spatial Extent: The report states that several locations have been identified, but specific zones are not given directly. They would need to be identified on Map 43 (not provided).
> 
> Temporal Pattern: The report does not provide specific temporal patterns.
> 
> Potential Expansion/Changes: The active and potential sand borrow sites may conflict with wind development proposals. These sites will presumably continue to be used for sand extraction in the near future.
> 
> Stakeholders: USACE, developers of offshore wind turbines, Delaware Geological Survey.
> 
> Sources: Information on potential future borrow sites obtained from the Delaware Geological Society.
> 
> Other Notes: Current sand borrow locations may be excluded from offshore wind development due to potential conflicts.
> 
> Activity Name: Artificial Reefs
> 
> Description: Installed structures that add complexity to the seafloor and act as habitats for fish and benthic organisms. They are also used as popular fishing spots for both recreational and commercial purposes.
> 
> Current Status: Ongoing activity, managed by state-specific Departments or Divisions of Fish & Wildlife.
> 
> Spatial Extent: The report mentions a total of 56 reefs, with 19 within the study area, but does not provide specifics. The exact areas would need to be identified on Map 43 (not provided).
> 
> Temporal Pattern: The report does not specify any temporal pattern.
> 
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Existing artificial reefs might create conflicts with wind turbine installations due to physical obstructions, affecting the micro-siting of turbines.
> 
> Stakeholders: Departments of Fish & Wildlife in Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland, recreational and commercial fishers, offshore wind developers.
> 
> Sources: Information is sourced from the individual state Departments of Fish & Wildlife, but direct references are not provided.
> 
> Other Notes: These reefs, due to their use as fishing resources and as habitation for marine life, form significant conflict areas for wind turbine placement.

> Can you organize this into a table with all of the fields, with a row for each activity?
