> what is mission and purpose of this organization: "Global Foundation for Girls is an intermediary, advocate, resource provider, and network for community organizations that work with girls, gender-diverse youth, birthing persons of color and children in crisis worldwide.
> 
> Our Model
> Grants Making: We utilize, partner with, and support exceptional community-centered BIPOC-led organizations in order to shift the philanthropic landscape to an ecosystem that contributes more equitably — with the result that girls, gender fluid youth, and birthing persons in target communities gain access to the resources they need.
> Capacity: We support local organizations, providing training, webinars, conventions, and development resources; tools that help organizations sustain their operations while expanding their outreach.
> Market Place: Our network shares information collaboratively — trends, open-source materials, resources, news — within our global marketplace.
> Global Network: We are active thought partners, serving global communities, girls, gender fluid youth, birthing persons, and allied organizations, in order to advance and support the advocacy movement.
> Policy, News and Advocacy: We are a hub for knowledge sharing and updates — a source for the mutual exchange of ideas and information which can influence activism, policy, and advocacy around global issues of child welfare, birthing persons, gender expansive youth and girls of color.

> Our Method
> Global Foundation for Girls GFG) is a Black Female Youth led intermediary that acts as a modern day Harriet Tubman, redirecting wealth distribution to BIPOC-led community organizations which serve girls, gender-fluid youth, and birthing persons of color. We hold a dual responsibility: to amplify the work of grassroot organizations, and to respond as an advocate, news distributor, resource provider, capacity builder, and network convenor around the core topics of Racial injustice, Gender injustice, Birth injustice & Reproductive Violence, Gender Based Violence and Crisis. Authentically representative of the organizations we serve, and cognizant of the challenges faced, we are ideally situated to provide tangible support that makes for real change in funding, policy, and visibility. GFG hopes to be a thought leader, catalyst, innovator, and partner that fortifies community organizations, and acts to disrupt, reduce, and eliminate the harms experienced in communities of color. We focus specifically on girls, gender-diverse youth and birthing persons and define youth as prenatal to 27 years of age.
> 
> Our volunteer, consultant, and leadership teams are composed almost entirely of young adult girls 18-27 years old, gender-fluid persons, & birthing people of color. We represent the demographic we serve, and are therefore best-positioned to understand the needs of our constituents. As an organization led entirely by young activists, Black women/girls, non-binary, gender-fluid and birthing persons fighting for change in their own communities. We were founded because we acknowledged the present day and historical gaps in the philanthropic space led by BIPOC leaders and positioned to respond to grassroot community groups on the ground supporting sustainable efforts for girls, gender-fluid youth and birthing persons.
> 
> We practice Anti-Oppressive, Trust Based and Grantee-Led Philanthropy centering the voices and needs of our networks on the ground.  Our work with diverse communities starts with connection (to us and to each other), network building, needs alignment and customized support. Organizations within our network receive training, capacity building, resource development and amplification of their work, needs and message to a greater audience."
