> Below is a story from the Fables of La Fontaine in French. Please produce an English version of the key elements of the story, in the style of Caryl Hart’s children’s writing. An excerpt of Caryl Hart’s writing is below:
>  
> A little princes lived inside a little tiny house.
> Her servant was a tabby cat, her butler was a mouse.
> Her father made the porridge and her mother chopped the wood,
> And Princess Sophie rode her bike, like every princess should.
>  
> In the yard behind the shed, a magic beanstalk grew.
> A giant lived right at the top (as giants often do).
> At night, the giant’s stomping made the people sob and shake.
> “That shellfish giant!” Sophie scowled. “He’s keeping me awake.”
>  
> The princes asked her parents, “Why are giants mean and bad?”
> “Always have been,” said her mother. “Always will be,” said her dad.
> He found a book of fairy tales they kept high on a shelf.
> “It says so here, in black and white. Look, read it for yourself.”
>  
> So Sophie read a story set in murky days of old,
> When Jack climbed up a beanstalk and discovered piles of gold.
> A giant roared, “Get off my stuff! I’ll grind your bones for bread!
> I’ll FEE FI FO and FUN and then I’ll bob you on the head!”
>  
> That night poor Sophie tossed and turned. “Our giant’s such a pest.
> If only he would go to sleep, we might all get some rest.”
> She read about a witch who made a house from gingerbread.
> It made her tummy rumble and a plan formed in her head.
>  
> At midnight, Princess Sophie took some bottles and some packets.
> She piled them in her backpack then buttoned up her jacket.
> She clambered up the beanstalk. Brave Sophie didn’t stop
> Till she reached the giant’s castle, that was balanced on the top.

> LE FAUCON ET LE CHAPON
> 
> Une traîtresse voix bien souvent vous appelle  ;
>                Ne vous pressez donc nullement :
> Ce n'était pas un sot, non, non, et croyez-m'en,
>                Que le Chien de Jean de Nivelle (1)
> Un citoyen du Mans, Chapon de son métier (2)
>                Était sommé de comparaître
>                Par-devant les Lares (3) du maître,
> Au pied d'un tribunal que nous nommons foyer.
> Tous les gens lui criaient pour déguiser la chose,
> Petit, petit, petit : mais, loin de s'y fier,
> Le Normand et demi (4) laissait les gens crier :
> Serviteur (5), disait-il, votre appât est grossier ;
>                On ne m'y tient pas ; et pour cause.
> Cependant un Faucon sur sa perche (6) voyait
>                Notre Manceau qui s'enfuyait.
> Les Chapons ont en nous fort peu de confiance,
>                Soit instinct, soit expérience.
> Celui-ci qui ne fut qu'avec peine attrapé,
> Devait le lendemain être d'un grand soupé,
> Fort à l'aise, en un plat, honneur dont la Volaille
>                Se serait passée aisément.
> L'Oiseau chasseur lui dit : Ton peu d'entendement
> Me rend tout étonné. Vous n'êtes que racaille,
> Gens grossiers, sans esprit, à qui l'on n'apprend rien.
> Pour moi, je sais chasser, et revenir au maître.
>                Le vois-tu pas à la fenêtre ?
> Il t'attend : es-tu sourd ? Je n'entends que trop bien,
> Repartit le Chapon ; mais que me veut-il dire,
> Et ce beau Cuisinier armé d'un grand couteau ?
>                Reviendrais-tu pour cet appeau (7) :
>                Laisse-moi fuir, cesse de rire
> De l'indocilité qui me fait envoler,
> Lorsque d'un ton si doux on s'en vient m'appeler.
>                Si tu voyais mettre à la broche
>                Tous les jours autant de Faucons
>                Que j'y vois mettre de Chapons,
> Tu ne me ferais pas un semblable reproche.

> THE FALCON AND THE CAPON
> 
> Once a trickster voice would beckon,
>                   Rush not to answer its call.
> It was no fool, believe me, folks,
>                   The Dog of Jean de Nivelle (1)
> A gentleman from Le Mans, a Capon by trade (2)
>                   Was summoned to appear
>                   Before the master's Lares (3),
> At the foot of a tribunal that we call the hearth.
> Everyone shouted to deceive him,
> Little, little, little: but, far from trusting them,
> The half-Norman (4) let the people shout:
> Servant (5), he said, your bait is crude;
>                   You can't trick me; and for a good reason.
> Yet a Falcon perched (6) saw
>                   Our Manceau who was fleeing.
> The Capons have very little trust in us,
>                   Either instinctively or from experience.
> This one, who was only caught with difficulty,
> Was to be a grand feast the next day,
> Very comfortable, in a dish, an honor that the Poultry
>                   Would have gladly forgone.
> The hunting bird said to him: Your lack of understanding
> Amazes me. You're but rabble,
> Rough folks, witless, who never learn.
> For me, I know how to hunt, and return to the master.
>                   Don't you see him at the window?
> He awaits you: are you deaf? I hear all too well,
> Replied the Capon; but what does he want to tell me,
> And this lovely Chef armed with a large knife?
>                   Would you return for that lure (7) :
>                   Let me flee, stop laughing
> At the disobedience that makes me fly,
> When I am called in such a sweet tone.
>                   If you saw as many Falcons
>                   Put on the spit
>                   Every day as I see Capons,
> You would not reproach me in the same way.

> THE FALCON AND THE ROOSTER
> 
> In a town, quite like yours, lived a Rooster named Red,
> His life was quite simple, till a call filled him with dread.
> "Folks often call with promises, don't be in haste to heed,
> Remember Jean de Nivelle's Dog (1), who showed wisdom indeed!"
> 
> Red was a simple rooster, from the town of Le Mans (2),
> One day, he was asked to visit the master's clan,
> Right by the hearth, where everyone gathered to dine,
> But he heard the sweet call, knew it was a sign.
> 
> "Little, little, little", the voices would chant,
> But Red was clever, he knew this enchantment.
> "I won't be tricked, your bait is bare,
> You won't catch me in your snare!"
> 
> A Falcon from his perch (6), watched Red make a dash,
> "Capons are often wary, from instinct or past clash,
> This one evaded capture, a feat hard to repeat,
> Tomorrow, he's the feast, a treat we'll gladly eat.
> 
> "Poor rooster", said the Falcon, "your judgment seems so poor,
> You're simple folks, no wit, learning seems a chore.
> I can hunt and return to master, I've learnt the rules,
> Can't you see him at the window, or are you all fools?"
> 
> "I hear you, Falcon," Red replied, his voice quite low,
> "But what's that cook saying, with his knife's shiny glow?
> You'd come back for that bait, it's clear,
> Let me run, your laughter's all I hear!
> 
> "Laugh not at my flight, when sweetly they call,
> If every day on the spit, Falcons met their fall,
> Just as us Roosters do, in number and name,
> You

> Here is a previous draft:
> 
> In a cozy little town lived a big, chubby chicken,
> Much larger than the rest, as fast as the clock's tickin'.
> He was called to the farmer's house, by the fireplace warm and bright,
> But he saw the cook's big, shiny knife and it gave him quite a fright.
> 
> "Here, chick, chick, chick," the townsfolk would sing,
> But the big chicken knew it wasn't a good thing.
> He'd waddle away fast, feathers all aflutter,
> "Your trick won't fool me, good sirs, I'm not some bread and butter!”
> 
> A falcon perched high saw the chicken's brave escape,
> He knew these big chickens were not easy to shape.
> This one, plump and hard to catch, was set for a big meal,
> A guest of honor in a stew, a thought he didn't feel.
> 
> The hunting bird scolded, "Your small wit makes me smirk.
> You big chickens are silly, all fluff and no groundwork.
> I, however, know to hunt and to my master, return.
> Don't you see him by the window, awaiting your sojourn?”
> 
> "I hear you loud and clear," retorted the big chicken,
> "But what does the cook mean with his knife so stricken?
> Would you come back for such a lure, oh do let me be,
> Don't laugh at my refusal to heed the sweet decree.
> 
> If you saw skewered on the spit, as many falcons a day,
> As I see big chickens cooked in a most ghastly way,
> You wouldn't scold me for the fears that make me fly,
> When called in such soft tones, under the open sky."
> 
> Can you make a new version with the following changes (and any other improvements to the flow):
>  - "as fast as the clock's tickin'" - Does this mean it could run fast? This isn't clear.
>  - "the townsfolk would sing" - Why are all the townsfolk involved? Shouldn't it just be the farmer?
>  - "were not easy to shape" - This isn't clear.
>  - "a thought he didn't feel" - Also, odd wording.
>  - Replace the words "sojourn" and "stricken" to simplify the language.

> In a snug little town, there lived a plump, hearty hen,
> Bigger than all others, but couldn’t outrun the pen.
> He was called to the farmhouse, where the fireplace was alight,
> But seeing the cook's gleaming knife, he was filled with fright.
> 
> "Come, chick, chick, chick," the farmer would coo,
> But the savvy hen knew this wasn't anything new.
> He'd shuffle away quickly, feathers all in a flurry,
> "Your ruse won't trick me, good sir, I'm in no hurry!”
> 
> From a high perch, a falcon spied the hen's escape,
> He knew these plump birds often found a landscape.
> This one, plump and elusive, was the feast for tomorrow,
> A dish of honor in a stew, a prospect filled with sorrow.
> 
> The hunting bird chided, "Your small wit does amaze,
> You big hens are foolish, all fuzz and no phrase.
> I, on the other hand, know to hunt and to my master, return.
> Don't you see him at the window, his expectant gaze to earn?”
> 
> "I hear you loud and clear," the hen quickly clucked,
> "But what does the cook say, with his knife all tucked?
> Would you come back for such a bait, let me go free,
> Don't chuckle at my wisdom to not heed the call so sweet.
> 
> If you saw pinned on the spit, as many falcons a day,
> As I see hens cooked, a dreadful display,
> You wouldn't mock me for the fears that make me fly,
> When summoned in such soft tones, under the blue sky."

>  - "couldn’t outrun the pen" - This is still unclear.
>  - "often found a landscape" - What does this mean?
>  - "and no phrase" - Odd word choice.
>  - "knife all tucked" - Odd word choice.
