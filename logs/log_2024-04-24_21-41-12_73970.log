> My wife went to China in 2007 as a tourist. What kind of visa would she have had, under the Chinese visa system?
**assistant**:
> Under the Chinese Visa system in 2007, your wife would likely have had an "L Visa," which was the type designated for tourists. These were issued to foreigners who intended to go to China for sightseeing or to visit family or friends. If she was traveling as part of a tour group, she may have had a group L visa. These could be single-entry, double-entry, or multiple-entry visas, based on her travel plans. The validity of the visa could range from 3 months to 12 months.
