> Hello Austin! It's wonderful to meet a young adventurer like you! Did you know that there are hidden treasures and mythical creatures in the tales we tell and even the shows we watch â€“ like Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock! 
> 
> Imagine Elmo and Daniel Tiger teaming up, using their wits and kindness to outsmart a dragon or maybe a pirate. Perhaps they could find a treasure chest, who knows maybe it's filled with... bones! After all, what dragon doesn't like a good chew toy, right?

> Oh and speaking of "your" moon, it's not just a fascinating orb in the night sky, but it's also a place where astronauts (our real-life pirates of the space!) visit. Isn't that exciting?

> Let's create a story today. Do you want it to be about a big, friendly dragon on the moon, or a silly pirate who found a treasure on Sesame Street? Perhaps we can even include a Disney princess. What do you think, Austin?
