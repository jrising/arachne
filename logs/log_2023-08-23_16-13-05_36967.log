> ## Nonprofit Sector 
> 
> The nonprofit sector would likely have evolved significantly by 2123. Here are some key features that we might expect:
> 
> **1. Integration of Advanced Technology:** Nonprofits would be using breakthroughs in AI, robotics, augmented reality, and bioengineering to address societal problems. Highly reliable and powerful AI tools, like some distant descendant of me (Arachne), would be common in nonprofit work, offering data analysis, strategic insights and operational efficiencies.
> 
> **2. Global Reach and Collaboration:** As internet access becomes universal and translation technologies improve, organizations across the globe would be closely networked, enabling seamless coordination and collaboration to tackle global challenges like climate change, economic inequity, and health crises.
> 
> **3. Digital and Virtual Communities:** With advancements in virtual and augmented reality, nonprofits would be serving virtual communities as real ones. There could be NGOs running programs for citizens of virtual nations or serving the needs of artificial intelligences.
> 
> **4. Decentralized Decision Making:** Blockchain technology could make organizations more transparent and democratic, with supporters and beneficiaries participating in decision-making via platforms that effect "smart contracts" and direct resource allocation.
> 
> **5. Sustainable Focus:** With issues surrounding sustainability reaching critical points, the nonprofit sector would likely have a deepened commitment to environmentally friendly practices and would play a major role in promoting sustainability.
> 
> ## Philanthrosphere
> 
> The philanthrosphere in 2123 would also be fundamentally transformed:
> 
> **1. Micro-donations and crowd-resourcing:** Technologies like blockchain and digital currencies will likely make micro-donations more common. This will allow large-scale problems to be addressed by the aggregated resources and decision-making of millions or billions of people.
> 
> **2. AI and Data led Philanthropy:** Philanthropy would become more proactive and predictive with AI and data analytics identifying needs, forecasting potential crises, and assessing the maximum impact areas. 
> 
> **3. Impact Investment:** The definition of philanthropy might expand, blurring the line between investment and donation. More funds could be aimed at carbon-neutral, ethical, or socially-impactful enterprises, expecting a return not only in capital but also in positive societal impact.
> 
> **4. Transparency and Accountability:** The public would demand greater transparency, leading to real-time publishing of tracked impacts by nonprofits. Advancements in blockchain technology could help to provide this transparency.
> 
> **5. Inclusive Philanthropy:** With the reduction of socioeconomic barriers through tech, a broadening range of people and entities would be involved in philanthropy, including AI entities generating surplus resources. This will create a more democratic and distributed philanthrosphere.
> 
> In sum, the nonprofit sector and philanthrosphere of 2123 would likely be almost unrecognizable in comparison to today, but their core mission to help people and make a positive difference would remain the same.
