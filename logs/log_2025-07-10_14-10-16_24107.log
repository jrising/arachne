> I think Philadelphia has net metering. If I generate more power than I need to, over the whole year, can I make money? Or would my bill just be reduced to 0 in certain months?
**assistant**:
> In Philadelphia, and more broadly in Pennsylvania, net metering policies allow individuals who generate their own electricity (such as with solar panels) to receive credits for excess power they feed back into the grid. However, these policies are typically structured such that you cannot make a direct profit from them.
> 
> Under Pennsylvania's net metering rules, excess generation is usually credited to your bill at the retail rate, effectively reducing your bill. If you generate more electricity than you use over the course of a billing period, those credits can be carried over to future bills. However, the goal of most net metering policies is to offset your energy consumption, not to provide a revenue stream. 
> 
> At the end of the annual period (often a year), if you have accumulated excess credits, they might be reimbursed at a much lower “avoidance rate,” which is closer to the wholesale rate the utility pays for electricity, rather than the retail rate. This means that the value of any excess credits is typically lower than what you pay for power.

> To maximize your investment, your goal should be to balance your energy production with your consumption over the year, essentially aiming to reduce your electricity bill to zero without expecting significant additional income. As energy policies can change, it’s wise to check any recent updates directly with your utility or relevant state body.
