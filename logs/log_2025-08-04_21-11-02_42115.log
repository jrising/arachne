> I am writing a letter to members of the Coalition of Ministries of Finance. Here's an example previous letter:
> ===
> Dear XXX,
> 
> 
> Thank you for being part of the Steering Committee, the broader community of practice, and for your strong thought leadership in the initiative around revamping economic analysis and modelling, co-led by the United States Department of the Treasury and the Danish Ministry of Finance. We hope this effort can have substantial impact in all 90+ members of the Coalition of Finance Ministers through peer-learning and knowledge exchange.
>  
> As you are aware, a concrete starting point of our initiative is to explore the daunting questions around the climate policies, investments, and risks that you as a Ministry of Finance are grappling with and the tools you have or are developing to address these questions. 
>  
> To inform the focus of the flagship Coalition report, we would like to better understand the climate-related analytical capabilities you have as a Ministry, your climate policy priorities across your core functions, what type of economic analysis and modelling tools you are using, the barriers and challenges you face, as well as where you see the biggest opportunities to enhance your capabilities.
> 
> 
> We therefore would like to invite you to a 60 min semi-structured interview. It would be beneficial for a representative of both your domestic policy team and a representative of your economic analysis and modelling team to join the interview. Additionally, we will reach out to you separately in the near future with some instructions to complete a short 25 min survey. We would highly appreciate you taking the time to fill this out. This can be done in parallel to the interview process or afterwards.

> I think I need something brief as a preamble like the first two paragraphs ("Thank you for being..." and "As you are aware...") since this will also be related to climate risks. Specifically, it is a project about understanding the potential benefits of adaptation. Can you suggest an short intro, but one that doesn't follow the previous too closely, since they already got that one?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Here's a brief introductory section that acknowledges their past involvement while introducing the new focus on adaptation benefits:

> ---
> 
> Dear XXX,
> 
> We are grateful for your involvement as part of the Steering Committee and the vibrant community dedicated to transforming economic analysis and modelling in collaboration with international partners, such as the United States Department of the Treasury and the Danish Ministry of Finance. Your contributions continue to be invaluable to our mission of enhancing global economic resilience through shared knowledge and initiatives.
> 
> Building on our collective efforts, we are now embarking on a focused project to explore the significant opportunities that climate adaptation presents. As key stakeholders, your insights into how Ministries of Finance can leverage adaptation strategies to mitigate risks and drive sustainable growth will be crucial to directing our flagship Coalition report.
