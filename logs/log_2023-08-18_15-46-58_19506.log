> I am writing a report on potential activities in Delaware marine waters. One activity is military operations, and there are two large military operating areas that overlap Delaware's planning region: the VACAPES OPAREA near shore, and the Atlantic City OPAREA further out. Here is a description of these areas in general:
> An Operating Area (OPAREA) in where national defense training exercises and system qualification tests are routinely conducted. OPAREA boundaries are formally established by national designation and by international treaty for national defense training purposes. OPAREAs allow for specific exercises and training events to be coordinated with other federal, state, and local agencies, and also the general public using the Local Notice to Mariners.
> 
> There is also a ship shock trial area south of the Delaware planning zone. Interestingly, this area was shifted further out-to-sea:
> In response to a comment received by National Marine Fisheries Service during the public comment
> period for the Marine Mammal Protection Act Proposed Rule the Navy assessed and agreed to move the
> Ship Shock Trial Area located in the VACAPES OPAREA away from the Mid-Atlantic Planning Awareness
> Area (PAA) and to include a 5 NM buffer between the Mid-Atlantic PAA and the Ship Shock Trial Area.
> 
> Please write a description of the military use of the Delaware planning area for the report.

> # Military Use of the Delaware Planning Area
> 
> The Delaware planning area, a critical region in the state's marine jurisdiction, houses a range of operational activities, including significant military operations. These operations occur within two key military operating areas (OPAREA): the Virginia Capes (VACAPES) OPAREA near shore and the Atlantic City OPAREA further out.
> 
> OPAREAS are designated zones where the US Department of Defense conducts routine national defense training exercises and system qualification tests. These areas are formally established through national designation and international treaties. The intention behind these designated spaces is to localize specific military exercises and training events, fostering a coordinated approach with federal, state, local agencies, and the general public, primarily through Local Notices to Mariners.
> 
> Closer to the coast, the VACAPES OPAREA serves as an active military operational zone. Here, rigorous training exercises for national defense are conducted, with activities overseen and managed in such a way to reduce any potential conflict or disruption with other ocean uses.
> 
> The Atlantic City OPAREA, further offshore, also plays a significant role in military readiness. Again, it provides a specific location for defense training activities, and, given its offshore location, it may often be used for larger scale or more intensive training operations, likely involving naval and air force components.
> 
> South of the Delaware planning zone, there is also a Ship Shock Trial Area. Providing an essential place for the Navy to test the resilience of their ships against undersea explosions, these trials help to ensure the vessels' performance in critical situations.
> 
> Notably, following public comment during a period designated for the Marine Mammal Protection Act's Proposed Rule, the Navy conducted an evaluation and opted to adjust the Ship Shock Trial Area. The result was a shift of trial operations further out to sea to mitigate any potential impact on marine life. The modified plan has also incorporated a 5 Nautical Mile (NM) buffer zone between the Mid-Atlantic Planning Awareness Area (PAA) and the Ship Shock Trial Area to safeguard local marine ecosystems.
> 
> Overall, the Delaware planning area plays a crucial role in harboring and facilitating diverse military operations, from drilling exercises to ship shock trials, providing a controlled environment that aims to mitigate any unnecessary disruptions to other sea users and the marine environment. The operational procedures in place display a commitment to harmonizing military readiness, ocean use, and environmental stewardship.
