> What is the name of the French(?) paiting style that generally shows groups of people in repose in beautiful outdoor settings, sometimes naked.
**assistant**:
> The painting style you're referring to is likely "Fête galante", a term used to describe a category of painting specially created by the French Academy in 1717 to accommodate the works of Jean-Antoine Watteau. A Fête galante (which translates roughly to 'courtship party') involves groups of elites robed in contemporary dress (or sometimes partially or fully nude) having a romantic party or musical gathering in an outdoor setting, often a lush and idyllic landscape. These paintings typically exude a sense of leisure, hedonism, and theatricality.

**assistant**:
> The painting style you might be thinking of is "Rococo", which is closely related to the Fête galante genre. Rococo art emerged in the early 18th century in France and was characterized by its ornate, light-hearted, and playful themes. Rococo paintings often depicted scenes of leisure, elegance, and the pursuit of pleasure, portraying an idealized vision of "the good life" enjoyed by the aristocracy and upper classes in the 18th century. The style emphasized pastel colors, delicate forms, and decorative elements, reflecting a taste for refinement and luxury.
