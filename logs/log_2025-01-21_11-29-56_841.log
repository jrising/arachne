> After development and execution of the Education and Engagement Plan for each selected building, the Hub anticipated increased knowledge and understanding of the importance of energy efficiency and electrification among residents in low-income and disadvantaged communities, as well as relevant and complimentary assistance programs offered by the District. Tenants in buildings participating in the AHRA will have a better understanding of the building upgrades implemented in their buildings, along with their benefits and impacts. For buildings that have engaged with implementation of the post-retrofit engagement strategy, residents of those buildings will have a better understanding of how to operate and maintain tenant-controlled equipment. Tenants will have voiced their concerns and provided feedback on programs, with the objective that such feedback will inform improvements to both existing and future programs.

> # Outcomes
> 
> Following the completion of the Education and Engagement Plan, the Hub expects to foster more profound comprehension and appreciation for energy efficiency and electrification within the residents of low-income and disadvantaged communities. This includes knowledge of the relevant support programs offered by the District. 
> 
> For the participants residing in the buildings covered under the AHRA, we anticipate an increase in understanding of the enhancements made to their buildings. They will be familiarized with the benefits and impacts of these upgrades. In addition, for buildings that have followed through with the post-retrofit engagement initiative, there will be a boost in the occupants' grasp of operating and maintaining tenant-controlled equipment. 
> 
> We expect tenants to voice their concerns and offer feedback on the programs, with the guiding aim being to use such input to enhance both existing and forthcoming programs.
> 
> Success will be visible in:
> 
> - Meeting the goals outlined by the district.
> - Joining efforts to ensure sustainable and health measures are implemented thereby serving the populations in need.
> - A larger audience that understands sustainability, particularly in historically under-resourced areas.
> - The realization that there are resources for them and knowing how to access these resources.
> - Knowing whom to contact and how to engage with them.
> - Guidance and support in ensuring compliance with deadlines.

Working alongside the professional organizations that exist for each discipline--architects, green building experts, building owners and operators, real estate brokers and tenants, and more--as well as DC government, it bridges the divides that typically exist in this industry with new conversation and resources. The Hub is not afraid to have difficult conversations about barriers and challenges, and to facilitate discussions that lead to shared understanding, aligned goals, and collaboration.

> The Hub stands out by actively uniting practitioners throughout a building's lifecycle. It collaborates with various professional organizations—architects, green building experts, building owners, operators, real estate brokers, tenants, and more—and partners with the DC government to break down industry barriers through dialogue and shared resources. The Hub courageously addresses challenges, facilitates tough discussions, and fosters shared understanding, aligned goals, and collaboration.

> In Fall 2024, IMT and partners were awarded $5.5M by the Department of Energy through the second round of their Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation grant. We will apply this funding over three years to the Building Performance Standard Pathway Alternatives and Training Hubs (BPS PATH) project.
>  A major focus of the project will be developing and testing a standardized and replicable framework for building performance standard alternative compliance pathways. While BPS policies are working, standardized compliance options that drive performance but provide greater flexibility are needed–especially for capital- and capacity-constrained buildings like affordable housing, public schools, condominiums, and houses of worship. This project will allow more buildings to comply with a building performance standard, which is critical to ensuring that benefits of better buildings reach residents and communities with limited financial resources. 
> The project will have four integrated workstreams: Developing a new model regulatory framework for building performance standard alternative compliance pathways that is feasible, standardized, and replicable—and then providing technical assistance to our jurisdiction partners to adopt it; testing the framework through planning pilots to help under-resourced buildings in select jurisdictions comply with the building performance standard—and then updating the framework based on lessons learned; leveraging IMT and BE-Ex’s network of high performance building hubs (hubs) to develop localized training and implementation tools and  resources; and extending DOE software support for ACP implementation in coordination with NREL and PNNL.
> This work will begin in January 2025 and will take place in the following locations: State of California; State of Oregon; Berkeley, CA; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; Kansas City, MO; Montgomery County, MD; New York City, NY; San Francisco, CA; St. Louis, MO; and Washington, DC.

IMT’s Supporting Equitable Building Performance (SEBP) initiative, funded by the Department of Energy, creates relationships and shared goals between state and local governments and community members. These relationships are critical to making innovative building performance policies that will not only reduce energy and carbon in the built environment, but also address housing affordability and other resident quality of life factors, such as health and economic opportunity. Our experience working in nine cities and states, identifying tenant needs and building resilience methods sets the Hub and IMT apart as an experienced leader.

> In the past, IMT has worked alongside DCSEU in facilitating similar services for multifamily affordable housing through the Retrofit Accelerator program. Leveraging lessons learned from earlier phases, IMT aims to support under-resourced buildings through the early stages of BEPS Cycle 1. IMT helps connect these buildings with DCSEU resources and programs, demonstrating a successful history of collaboration with DCSEU to drive energy efficiency and sustainability efforts in the region.
