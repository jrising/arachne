**assistant**:
> The ratio of the standard deviation over the mean is called the "coefficient of variation" (CV). It is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution, and it's often used to assess the relative variability of data. The CV is particularly useful when you want to compare the degree of variation between datasets with different units or mean values. It is typically expressed as a percentage.
