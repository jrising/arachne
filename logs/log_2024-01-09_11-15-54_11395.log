**user**:
> I am teaching a class on Climate Change Economics, and I have weekly readings. I want to evaluate that students have been doing the readings. For graduate students, it's mostly papers, so I will use Perusall. But for undergrads, it's book chapters. How can I make sure students do the readings without a large extra time sink on either my part or theirs?
**assistant**:
> To ensure that undergraduate students are engaging with assigned book chapters you may want to employ a mix of low-effort, high-effectiveness strategies. Here are a few possibilities:
> 
> ### 1. Reading Quizzes
> 
> Perhaps the most common method, requiring students to take brief quizzes can ensure they do the readings. These quizzes need not be very long or difficult. They could be administered at the beginning of each class or online before the class meeting. You could use teaching platforms like Canvas or Google Classroom to easily create and grade these quizzes.
> 
> ### 2. Reflective Journaling
> 
> Have each student keep a reading journal, wherein they jot down a paragraph or two on key points, questions, or thoughts after each reading. You can ask them to submit these once a week for minor credit. Consider using peer review to share the load of reviewing these entries.
> 
> ### 3. Exit Tickets
> 
> Towards the end of each class, have students write a brief note or 'ticket' summarizing what they understood from the reading. This can also double as a quick way for students to raise queries or points of confusion.
> 
> ### 4. Reading Discussion Groups
> 
> Set up discussion groups where students meet (either physically or virtually) for a short time each week to discuss the readings. They could generate a group summary or other deliverable that provides evidence of their engagement.
> 
> ### 5. In-Class Activities
> 
> Use classroom activities that rely on understandings gleaned from the reading. This can be as simple as asking students to form pairs or small groups and briefly discuss a question that assumes comprehension of the reading.
> 
> Remember that each of these options will still require some effort on your part, or that of the TAs, if applicable. The key is to find the right balance between ensuring understanding and not overloading yourself or your students. You can also switch between these methods to keep things stackable and engaging.
**user**:
> Can you explain exit tickets more?
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Exit tickets are a form of assessment that allows you to quickly gauge student comprehension and reflect on their learning immediately after a class session. Here's how they work:
> 
> 1. **Timing**: Exit tickets are typically administered at the end of a class session, during the last few minutes. This allows students to consolidate their understanding and gives you a snapshot of what they grasped from the material covered.
> 
> 2. **Format**: Exit tickets can take various forms, depending on your preferred method of assessment and the nature of the readings or class discussion. They can be simple one-question prompts, short written responses, multiple-choice questions, or even brief group discussions.
> 
> 3. **Content**: The content of the exit ticket should align with the learning objectives or key points covered in the class session. You can use it to assess specific concepts, ask students to summarize the main takeaways, provide examples related to the readings, or identify any areas of confusion or questions they may have.
> 
> 4. **Logistics**: Distribute the exit tickets to students towards the end of the class session. Let them know that it's a brief assessment to gauge their understanding, and it should be completed before they leave the class. Collect the completed exit tickets as they exit the room or have them submit the responses online if you're using a digital platform.
> 
> 5. **Feedback**: Once you have collected the exit tickets, review the responses to not only assess student understanding but also identify patterns or areas where students may need additional support or clarification. Consider providing quick written or verbal feedback that can guide their further learning.
> 
> Exit tickets offer a convenient way to gather formative assessment data and provide students with an opportunity to reflect on their own learning. Additionally, they help you understand if the students have done the readings and absorbed the content covered in the class.
