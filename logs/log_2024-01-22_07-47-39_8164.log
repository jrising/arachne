**user**:
> I want to let my baby type on my computer in a mode where they can see their actions on the screen (ideally even producing more than letters), but without accidentally tabbing away and making other changes. Is there a tool that allows such an interactive locked screen on Mac OS?
**assistant**:
> While there are no built-in functions that exactly achieves this on macOS, there are applications designed for this purpose. One of these is AlphaBaby. 
> 
> AlphaBaby is an application that locks your keyboard and lets your baby press keys to see letters, shapes, and hear sounds. It basically acts as a fun interactive display where each key press triggers a fun response, but the baby cannot mess up your other work or settings. It also allows for custom images and sounds to be added for a more personalized experience. 
> 
> You can download AlphaBaby from the Mac App Store. Please note that it may require you to grant permission to control your computer, which is necessary to 'lock' the rest of the computer while the application is running.
> 
> Once you download and open AlphaBaby, you can click on the "Lock Screen" button or use the shortcut "Command+L" to lock the screen so your baby can start playing. To exit and unlock, simply press "Command+Q". 
> 
> Always remember to save any open work and close any important applications before giving your baby access to the keyboard with AlphaBaby running.
