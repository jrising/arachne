**user**:
> I have a PR on my github repo from another user. I want to accept their changes, but there's a conflict. Locally, I have checked out their changes with `git fetch origin pull/16/head:test-fix` and fixed the conflict. How can I now apply my fix, or otherwise merge the PR?
**assistant**:
> Here are the steps that can be taken to apply your fix and merge the PR:
> 
> 1. **Commit the changes:**
>  
>     After resolving the merge conflict on your local machine, you need to commit the changes. You can do this by running:
> 
>     ```bash
>     git add .
>     git commit -m "<Your message>"
>     ```
> 
>     The '<Your message>' is a placeholder for your intended commit message. For example, it could be: "Resolved merge conflicts".
> 
> 2. **Push the changes to your repository:**
> 
>     You can push the changes to your remote repository by running:
> 
>     ```bash
>     git push origin test-fix
>     ```
> 
>     This will push the changes to the branch `test-fix` on your remote repository.
> 
> 3. **Merge the fix to the main branch:**
> 
>     In order to merge these changes into your main branch (e.g., `master` or `main`) you need to:
> 
>     - Checkout to the master branch:
> 
>          ```bash
>          git checkout master
>          ```
> 
>     - Merge the `test-fix` branch:
> 
>         ```bash
>         git merge test-fix
>         ```
> 
> 4. **Push the changes to the original repository:**
> 
>     After merging, you will need to push the changes to the original repository's corresponding branch:
> 
>     ```bash
>     git push origin master
>     ```
> 
> 5. **Closing the pull request:**
> 
>     At this stage, the changes from the `test-fix` branch have been merged into the `master` branch in your repository. You can now close the pull request on GitHub. Usually, GitHub will detect and mark the pull request as merged. However, if it doesn't, you can manually close it by going to the pull request and clicking `Close`.
> 
> 6. **Delete the test-fix branch:**
> 
>     Lastly, now that everything is sorted, you can delete the `test-fix` branch both locally and remotely:
> 
>     ```bash
>     # Delete local branch
>     git branch -d test-fix
> 
>     # Delete remote branch
>     git push origin --delete test-fix
>     ```
> 
> This way, you’re not making changes on someone else’s pull request but instead applying them to your own code and making your changes there.
