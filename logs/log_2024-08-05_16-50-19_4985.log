> In excel, it looks like VLOOKUP shows a 0 when the result is a blank cell (and otherwise the right value). How can I get these 0's to be blanks?
**assistant**:
> You can handle this issue by combining `IF`, `VLOOKUP`, and `ISBLANK` functions to replace the `0` values with blank cells. Here is a formula you can use:
> 
> ```excel
> =IF(VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE) = 0, "", VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE))
> ```
> 
> In this formula:
> - `VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE)` performs the lookup based on the value in `A2`.
> - `IF(VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE) = 0, "", VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE))` checks if the result of the `VLOOKUP` is `0`. If it is, it returns an empty string `""`. Otherwise, it returns the lookup result.
> 
> If `0` is a possible valid lookup result and you specifically want to check for blanks, a slightly more advanced approach would involve using an array formula or the `IF` and `ISBLANK` combination. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:
> 
> ```excel
> =IF(ISBLANK(VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE)), "", VLOOKUP(A2, B:C, 2, FALSE))
> ```
> 
> Note that `ISBLANK` checks if the cell referenced by `VLOOKUP` is blank. If it is, it returns an empty string `""`. Otherwise, it returns the actual lookup result.
> 
> Remember to adjust the `A2`, `B:C`, and `2` parts according to your specific data range and lookup requirements.
