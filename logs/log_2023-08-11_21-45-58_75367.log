> Undersea Electricity Transmission Hub
> Trans-Elect and Atlantic Grid Development have put forward initial plans for the construction of a subsea high-voltage transmission line. The Atlantic Wind Connection (AWC) will be designed to transport marine-based renewable energy to shore with few connection points rather than individual projects connecting to the grid independently. The AWC intends to connect up to 7,000 MW of power through high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines, making few landings on shore to minimize the number of landfalls necessary to bring offshore energy to the grid (AWC, 2011).
> The initial schematic published by the AWC depicts one connection point within the bounds of the study area, to be brought onshore in southern Delaware and connect at Indian River (AWC, 2011). Onshore connection points at Piney Grove (Maryland) and Cardiff (New Jersey) are also locally relevant connection points (AWC Right of Way Request, 2011). Rather than bringing all projects to shore to connect to the Delmarva/DEC transmission lines, offshore wind generated electricity may connect directly to this line and come ashore accordingly. Therefore, the planned hub locations are a consideration for the siting of offshore wind projects in order to minimize shore-side disruptions and seafloor disturbance. Cable locations and on-shore tie-ins were digitized from the PDF map available for download from the AWC website (AWC Right of Way Request, 2011).

> Transmission lines are represented on land in Delaware. There are several small substation points that could be used for small-scale development, such as 50 to 100 MW. For larger projects, a likely substation tie-in is identified at the Indian River substation. This is where the proposed Atlantic Wind Connection (AWC) - a high voltage direct current (HVDC) power line - could connect at Indian River. Substations, transmission lines, and the connection cables and points of the AWC are displayed, with the five distinct phases of installation differentiated.

> 
> - *Description*: These facilities are designed to transport marine-based renewable energy to the shore, potentially connecting up to 7,000 MW of power through HVDC transmission lines. The hub intends to make few landings on shore to minimize the number of necessary landfalls to bring offshore energy to the grid. Currently, the hub is specifically mentioned as a key consideration for the siting of offshore wind projects to minimize disruptions.
>   
> - *Current Status*: Plans for construction have been put forward by Trans-Elect and Atlantic Grid Development with a schematic published, but the report does not specify whether construction has begun.
> 
> - *Spatial Extent*: The connection points are revealed to be at southern Delaware specifically at Indian River plus other locally relevant connection points at Piney Grove (Maryland) and Cardiff (New Jersey).
> 
> - *Temporal Pattern*: Specific details about timing or stages are not given in the section provided.
> 
> - *Potential Expansion/Changes*: There's a possibility of more such hubs/substations to increase grid connectivity as offshore wind power generation grows.
> 
> - *Stakeholders*: Atlantic Wind Connection (project owners), Trans-Elect, Atlantic Grid Development, and potentially Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey (as points of connections).
> 
> - *Sources*: Information cited comes from the Atlantic Wind Connection and their "Right of Way Request" document from 2011.
> 
> - *Other notes*: Cable locations, on-shore tie-ins, and the five distinct phases of installation can be sourced from a PDF map available for download from the AWC website.

> **Activity Name: Utilization of Substation Points for Small-scale Development**
> 
> - *Description*: Multiple small substation points are identified that could be used for the development of smaller-scale projects, generating between 50 to 100 MW of power.
> 
> - *Current Status*: The report doesn't specifically state whether these small-scale development projects have been initiated.
> 
> - *Spatial extent*: This applies to several small substation points located on land -- potentially in Delaware based on the information provided.
> 
> - *Temporal Pattern*: No specific details about timing or stages are given in the section provided.
> 
> - *Potential Expansion/Changes*: Depending on the success of smaller-scale projects, there may be an expansion to other substation points in the future.
> 
> - *Stakeholders*: Not explicitly stated, but we can expect the Delaware government, local power companies, and perhaps independent power producers would be involved.
> 
> - *Sources*: The information refers to the Atlantic Wind Connection's 2011 works and plans.
> 
> - *Other notes*: For larger projects, a substation tie-in at Indian River is identified as likely, providing connection for the proposed Atlantic Wind Connection.
