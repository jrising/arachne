**user**:
> In google drive, is there a way to see who moved files out of a shared folder?
**assistant**:
> Google Drive, unfortunately, does not provide a straightforward way to see who moved files out of a shared folder. It is possible to view an activity overview on the Google Drive website, which mostly shows who added, edited or viewed a file. You can check this by:
> 
> 1. Going to the website version of Google Drive.
> 2. Clicking on the file.
> 3. Clicking on the "Details and activity" button on the top right section (it's an icon that looks like an 'i' in a circle).
> 4. Checking the Activity tab.
> 
> This may not help if the files were simply moved, though, as Google Drive does not log that activity specifically. You can, however, see who the last person to modify the file was, and could possibly infer if they moved it. 
> 
> To prevent unauthorized relocation or deletion of shared files in the future, I would advise setting the file access to "View only" or "Comment only" for those who should not have the ability to alter file locations.
