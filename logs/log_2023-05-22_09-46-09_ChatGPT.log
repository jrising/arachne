> James: What is the (usually) black gunk that gets into bath toys?
**assistant**:
> The black gunk you often find in bath toys is typically a type of mold or mildew. It thrives in warm, moist environments, so the inside of bath toys that are frequently in contact with water and then left to sit is an ideal breeding ground. This growth is fueled by soap residues and organic material present in bathwater, such as dead skin cells.

> What can be done to avoid getting this gunk?
**assistant**:
> To prevent mold or mildew from growing in bath toys, consider the following strategies:
> 
> 1. **Dry Them Out After Each Use:** After bath time, make sure to squeeze out any water inside the toys. Allow them to air dry completely before storing them away. This reduces the amount of moisture that mold and mildew need to grow.
> 
> 2. **Store in a Dry Place:** Keep the toys in an area with good ventilation to help them dry out quickly.
> 
> 3. **Clean Regularly:** Use a solution of warm water and mild dish soap, vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide to clean the toys. For a more thorough cleaning, you can soak the toys in a bleach solution (1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water) for about 15 minutes, then rinse well and let them air dry. 
> 
> 4. **Seal Holes:** Some parents opt to seal the holes in bath toys with waterproof glue or silicone. This prevents water from getting inside the toy in the first place.
> 
> 5. **Replace Regularly:** Even with these precautions, it might be necessary to replace bath toys every now and then to ensure they stay clean and safe.
