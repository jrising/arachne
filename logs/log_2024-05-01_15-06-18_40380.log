> What is the expected value of T^2, if T ~ Normal(0, 1)?
**assistant**:
> The expected value of T^2, where T is a standard normally distributed random variable, is essentially the variance of T, plus the square of the mean of T. 
> 
> For a standard normal distribution, the mean (μ) is 0, and variance (σ^2) is 1. This is often represented as N(0, 1).
> 
> Therefore, the expected value of T^2 is:
> 
> E(T^2) = Variance[T] + Mean[T]^2
>        = 1 + 0^2
>        = 1
