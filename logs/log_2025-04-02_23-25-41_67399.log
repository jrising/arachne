> ### Indicators of Ecosystem Change Relevant to Direct and Systemic Risks
> 
> The previous section summarized how changes to ecosystems add to the direct physical drivers of climate impacts, creating adverse consequences for human societies and potentially generating systemic risks. 
> 
> In principle, it is possible to estimate impacts in human terms, such as numbers of people affected. However, this estimation is sensitive to climate and socio-economic change, as well as to how resources and hazards are managed, and to adaptation decisions made by a large number of actors. For example, an estimate of the effects of a given climate scenario on the number of people flooded would need to consider local flood management practices and how these practices evolve over time. 
> 
> Impacts on crop production would depend on local farmer practices, adaptation at the farmer scale, and changes to national and international crop markets. The potential direct impacts of climate change are typically characterized using indicators, such as a change in the frequency of a specific return period flood or a change in the time taken for crops to reach maturity. 
> 
> There have been numerous studies at the global scale that produced indicators of the effect of these direct physical drivers, such as indicators characterizing the frequency of heat extremes, droughts, or flood impacts (e.g., Arnell et al., 2019). However, whilst various studies have assessed potential climate change impacts on ecosystems at global or local scales, they have generally expressed these in indicators relevant to ecosystems themselves rather than those indicating the consequences for human services or their implications. 
> 
> Mandle et al. (2021) noted that ecosystem conditions or processes are rarely proxies for ecosystem service delivery. Many studies have concentrated specifically on indicators of biodiversity, interpreted as the sum of variation among and within species. This approach reflects only one dimension of an ecosystem. Predicted impacts can vary widely, even among projections of the same biodiversity component (Bellard et al., 2012), due to the complexities involved in ecosystems.

> As outlined in Section 2, the focus here is on systemic risks with regional and global consequences. These risks may be generated by global-scale changes or changes in critical locations.
