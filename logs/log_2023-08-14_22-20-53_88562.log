> 2.1 Introduction
> Human-nature interactions have existed since the
> beginning of human history, but their scope and
> intensity have increased drastically since the In-
> dustrial Revolution, especially in the past several
> decades. Historically, most human-nature inter-
> actions were at the local scale, although some large-
> scale activities such as migrations and trade did
> occur. However, human-nature interactions at large
> scales have become much more frequent and faster
> than before (Liu et al., 2007a). With more people and
> fewer resources on the planet, the world has entered
> the epoch of the Anthropocene (Steffen et al., 2007).
> As the human population continues to increase,
> human impacts have spread to every corner of the
> earth (e.g., IPCC, 2008, Marsh, 1864, Millennium
> Ecosystem Assessment, 2005, Thomas Jr, 1956,
> Turner et al., 1990,Vitousek et al., 1997).Both human
> and natural systems have become more vulnerable,
> and the earth has crossed several planetary bound-
> aries (Rockstrom et al., 2009, Steffen et al., 2015).
> Such consequences have largely resulted from the
> historical views of human-nature relationships-
> humans should and can conquer nature (Liu, 2010),
> or humans can utilize nature without limits (Simon,
> 1996). Some scholars have recognized that human
> development is constrained by natural resources
> (e.g., Meadows et al., 2004) and that humans should
> maintain harmonious relationships with nature
> (e.g., in ancient Chinese and Native American cul-
> tures; Diamond, 2005, Shapiro, 2001). However,
> these views were largely downplayed or ignored
> in practice (Ehrlich and Pringle, 2008). For example,
> the major development model around the world
> has been "pollute first and clean up later." Even
> though some areas were cleaned up later, improve-
> ments were often made at the cost of damaging
> other areas (Hird, 1993).
> How to enable humans to prosper while sustain-
> ing natural systems is among the most challenging
> questions in the world today (Clark and Dickson,
> 2003, Kates et al., 2001, Matson, 2012). As human
> impacts continue to rise, more people have realized
> that the traditional human-dominant views cannot
> sustain life-supporting systems and new develop-
> ment paradigms are needed. A watershed event
> took place when the World Commission on Envir-
> onment and Development published the historic
> document Our CommonFuturein which sustainable
> development was proposed (World Commission
> on Environment and Development, 1987). The re-
> search and management communities have widely
> accepted the concept of sustainable development
> (meeting the needs of the present society without
> compromising future generations), but the practice
> of sustainable development has lagged behind.
> A major barrier to effective implementation of

>  a::..:--!::rlude human impacts on nature, but also ::.a::nre's influences on humans. Furthermore, sub- stantial progress has been made in the development and quantification of integrated conceptual frame- works (Liu et al., 2015). In this chapter, we set the stage for the remainder of the book by presenting an overview of a coupled human and natural sys- tem framework. We also demonstrate typology of coupled systems and apply the overall integrated framework to coupled human and wildlife systems. In addition, we highlight theoretical foundations
> and relevant methods for studying coupled systems and propose a model coupled system approach.
> 2.2 Overall conceptual framework
> Like all other studies, conceptual frameworks are essential for effective research on coupled human
> and natural systems. Such frameworks provide a shared set of variables for the design of data col- lection instruments, the conduct of fieldwork or experiments, and the analysis and integration of results (Ostrom, 2007).They help identify variables and relationships that may influence how policies enhance the sustainability of some components of a coupled system while potentially compromising the
> sustainability of other components. Frameworks connecting relevant variables can help integrate isolated knowledge obtained from separate stud- ies conducted in different places at different times. When presented in the form of diagrams (e.g., Fig- ure 2.1), they also present a visual representation of various components and their relationships.
> The core of the conceptual framework of coupled human and natural systems lies in the interactions and feedbacks between the human subsystem and the natural subsystem (Figure 2.1). The human sub-
> system includes diverse stakeholders (e.g., farmers,
> workers, and traders) working in different sectors
> e.g., agriculture, manufacturing, and trade). The
> natural subsystem consists of various abiotic (e.g.,
> geomorphic and climatic) and biotic (e.g., animal
> and vegetative) components. As Figure 2.1 shows,
> a coupled system is often hierarchically structured
> across multiple levels. It can have multiple tiers
> (Ostrom, 2009) with many components-each com-
> ponent can divide into subcomponents, and each
> subcomponent can further divide into subcompo-
> nents. The decision to choose which level of vari-
> ables for analysis is dependent on the questions and
> objectives of the project, feasibility, spatial and tem-
> poral scales, and the types of coupled systems (Os-
> trom, 2009). Various components interact with each
> other at the same or across different organizational
> levels inside a coupled system (i.e., internal or lo-
> cal couplings). For example, different stakeholders
> or sectors in a human subsystem may cooperate to
> solve a common problem, or compete for the same
> resources (Figure 2.1). Biotic components in the nat-
> ural subsystem interact with each other and rely on
> abiotic components for growth, survival, and repro-
> duction (Figure 2.1).
> Each coupled system also interacts with other
> coupled systems across spatial boundaries (Fig-
> ure 2.1; Liu et al., 2013). Such interactions may be
> carried out by flows or movement of matte1~en-
> ergy, and information. For example, even in many
> protected areas, people from outside come inside
> to collect resources (e.g., mineral, timber, and non-
> timber products), graze, hunt, and visit as tourists.
> Pollutants and diseases from outside may arrive in
> the protected areas through water flows (Rogers
> and Beets, 2001), air circulations (Bytnerowicz et al.,
> 2002), species dispersal (Ervin, 2003), and disposal
> by people (Saunders et al., 2002). Noises generated
> outside may also influence organisms and people
> inside a protected area. On the other hand, wild-
> life inside a protected area may roam across the
> boundaries to feed (Douglas-Hamilton et al., 2005),
> rest (Caro, 1999), and migrate (Gude et al., 2007).
> Similarly, residents inside a protected area may also
> use resources elsewhere through trade. Pollinators
> inside protected areas may fly to pollinate crops
> outside. The examples here illustrate interactions
> FRAMING SUSTAINABILITY OF COUPLED SYSTEMS 17
> of individual components in the focal coupled sys-
> tem and other coupled systems. Such interactions
> lead to interactions at the system level because
> other components and their relationships may be
> affected, and ultimately the entire systems may be
> affected.
> Interactions between humans and natural sub-
> systems evolve over time (Figure 2.1). The temporal
> variations may involve all aspects of human-nature
> interactions and result from coevolutionary human-
> nature relationships (Alberti, 2015). Human-nature
> interactions may go through several phases over
> time, from emergence to strengthening, weaken-
> ing, and dissolution. Each phase may last different
> durations. For example, many people began to use
> forests in rural China as fuelwood upon their settle-
> ment (Liu et al., 1999).The amount of fuelwood col-
> lection increased as human population increased.
> However, as electricity became more available and
> affordable, fuelwood use decreased. As a result of
> the new policy banning forest harvesting, forest
> harvesting was stopped and thus human-nature
> coupling in the form of forest harvesting was dis-
> solved (Yang et al., 2013a).
> The coupled human and natural systems approach
> also encompasses a number of fundamental con-
> cepts that describe complexities in human-nature
> interactions (Table 2.1). For example, time lags may
> occur in which the effect of the human subsystem
> on the natural subsystem (or vice versa) may take
> a long time to emerge. A new household may not
> form until approximately two decades after a child
> is born-when the child gets married (An and Liu,
> 2010). There are also legacy effects in which past
> events impact the current conditions and future tra-
> jectory of the system. Sometimes these effects ap-
> pear only after a threshold or tipping point has been
> reached, when sudden and unexpected changes
> happen.
> Compared to previous notions and practices re-
> lated to human-nature interactions, the coupled
> human and natural systems framework expli-
> citly emphasizes the feedbacks between humans
> and natural subsystems. Feedbacks occur when
> human activities lead to changes in natural sub-
> systems and changes in natural subsystems in
> turn affect human subsystems. On one hand, hu-
> mans rely on natural subsystems (e.g., ecosystem
> services such as clean water, fresh air, food, shel- ter, bioenergy) for survival and development (5). At the same time, humans alter the natural sub- systems, usually in a manner that degrades them. On the other hand, alteration to natural subsys- tems also affects humans in different ways (Estes et al., 2011, Foley et al., 2005). For example, cli- mate change can have devastating negative ef- fects on agricultural production. While reciprocal human-nature interactions were recognized a long time ago (Diamond, 1997, Ma and Wang, 1984, Marsh, 1864, McDorn1ell and Pickett, 1993, National Research Council, 1999, Odum, 1971,
> fragmentatio(nHassaendLathrop2,003)
> Thomas Jr, 1956, Turner et al., 1990, Vitouseketal., 1997), their complex patterns and processes are still not well understood (Diamond, 2005, Schnei- der and Londer, 1984). In the past, ecologists usu- ally focused on natural subsystems and excluded human impacts from their experiments and obser- vations (Redman et al., 2004). Researchers viewed humans as a nuisance-contaminating samples, skewing data, and biasing analyses. In contrast, social scientists often focused on humans but paid Jess attention to natural subsystems. The coupled system framework provides a platform for natural and social scientists to work together to quantify
> 
>  and integrate human-nature relationships at mul-
> tiple organizational levels across space and over
> time (Figure 2.1). Such quantification and integra-
> tion are essential to a better appreciation of the
> constraints and consequences of human activities
> and to developing better practices in socioeco-
> nomic development.
> Many frameworks of coupled systems have been
> developed. A major difference between our frame-
> work (Figure 2.1) and others is that ours explicitly
> specifies the interactions and feedbacks between
> the focal coupled system and other coupled sys-
> tems while other frameworks do not. In the cou-
> pled natural-human system diagram proposed
> by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), for
> example, there is no input from other systems or
> output to other systems (National Science Founda-
> tion, 2010, 2014). This framework implicitly treats
> each coupled system as a closed system, without
> interactions with the outside. In reality, this is not
> true for the vast majority of (if not all) systems.
> Among the ten frameworks reviewed (Binder
> et al., 2013), none of them explicitly specifies the
> feedbacks between the focal coupled system and
> other coupled systems. The framework proposed
> by Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom suggests inter-
> actions between the focal coupled system and
> other "ecosystems" (Ostrom, 2009). This frame-
> work also places the focal coupled system under
> "specific social, economic, and political settings"
> (Ostrom, 2009). Many studies have treated ex-
> ternal factors as drivers of changes in the focal
> coupled system (Defries et al., 2010, Lambin and
> Meyfroidt, 2011, Liu et al., 2012, Simberloff and
> VonHolle, 1999,Verburg et al., 2002,Stevens et al.,
> 2014). Other separate studies have considered
> the impact of the focal system on other systems
> as spatial externalities (Meyfroidt and Lambin,
> 2009, Wassenaar et al., 2007). Because there are
> now more interactions and feedbacks across sys-
> tem boundaries than ever before, it is important
> to consider them (Walker et al., 2009, Folke et al.,
> 2011). They exist not only between the focal sys-
> tem and adjacent coupled systems (Boersma and
> Parrish, 1999), but also between the focal system
> and distant coupled systems via "telecoupling"
> (socioeconomic and environmental interactions
> over distances; see Chapter 17, Liu et al., 2013).
> FRAMING SUSTAINABILITY OF COUPLEDSYSTEMS 19
> 2.3 Typologyof coupledhuman
> and natural systems
> There is a vast variety of terms used for coupled
> human and natural systems (see examples in Ta-
> ble 2.2). Some differences among them are trivial.
> For instance, the order of the words "human" and
> "natural" varies (e.g., coupled human and natural
> systems vs coupled natural and human systems). In
> some cases, the word "and" between "human" and
> "natural" is replaced by "-" (e.g., coupled human
> and natural systems vs coupled human-natural
> systems). In other cases, the word "coupled" is re-
> placed with "interlinked." Others differ in the use
> of keywords for human and natural subsystems
> (e.g., "social" instead of "human" and "ecological"
> instead of "natural"). These differences may be a
> matter of preferences and traditions. When using
> different keywords, sometimes they are viewed as
> either synonyms or specific cases of coupled human
> and natural systems that focus on specific aspects of
> human or natural components. Human subsystems
> encompass many dimensions, such as social, eco-
> nomic, and demographic. Similarly, natural subsys-
> tems also encompass many dimensions, including
> ecological, genetic, and biophysical.
> A commonly used concept, social-ecological
> systems (Brown, 2008, Folke et al., 2005), may be a
> synonym or a special case of coupled human and
> natural systems. This concept focuses on social
> aspects of the human subsystem and ecological
> aspects of the natural subsystem. However, the
> definitions of terms such as social and ecological
> may vary. Sometimes, "ecological" refers to all di-
> mensions of a natural subsystem, while in other
> situations to only one of the many dimensions of
> the natural subsystem (e.g., not including the bio-
> physical dimension). Similarly, sometimes "social"
> refers to all dimensions of humans, while in other
> situations, it refers to only one of the many dimen-
> sions of humans (i.e., social, not economic). The
> different uses of the same term appear not only in
> academic articles, but also in other circumstances
> such as names of institutions. For example, a unit
> within the NSF is the Directorate for Social, Behav-
> ioral, and Economic Sciences; social sciences are
> treated differently from economic and behavioral
> sciences. In other situations, social sciences include
> economics and other human-related disciplines. For example, the College of Social Sciences at Michigan State University and the Division of Social Science at Harvard University include departments of An- thropology, Economics, Psychology, and Sociology.
> Another commonly used concept is human- environment systems (Moran, 2010, Turner et al., 2003). When the word "environment" refers to the natural environment, it would be the same as cou- pled human and natural systems. However, the term environment sometimes refers to or includes
> the "built" environment (Ingold, 1995). In this case, human-€nvironment systems seem to emphasize the relationships among different aspects of human subsystems, rather than human-nature relation- ships. The built environment is constructed by hu- mans, and thus it is considered a part of the human subsystem.
> All these and other concepts (e.g., ecological- economic systems and population-€nvironment systems, Table 2.2) are related although there may be some subtle differences. The most important
> (Sataket al., 2008) (Schluteertal.,2009) (Lacitignoleatal.,201O) (Falket al.,2005) (Carpenteert al., 2001) (Craig2,0l0) (Young2,010) (Picketettal.,2004)

> The general conceptual framework (Figure 2.1) can

> natural systems. In this section, we use a coupled
> FRAMING SUSTAINABILITYOF COUPLEDSYSTEMS 21
> system in a rural forest setting as an example ap-
> plication (Figure 2.2), which provides the founda-
> tion for much of the research discussed throughout
> the rest of this book. In this coupled system, human
> populations make their livelihoods largely from
> direct interactions with local natural resources in
> forests, and in which conservation policies exist to
> protect biodiversity, especially endangered wild-
> life (Figure 2.2). The framework includes five main
> components that interact with one another, includ-
> ing Local Residents, Policies, Forests, Wildlife, and
> Contextual Factors. The first two components be-
> long to the human subsystem while Forests and
> Wildlife are parts of the natural subsystem. Contex-
> tual Factors cross human and natural subsystems
> in the focal coupled system and other coupled sys-
> tems. For the sake of simplicity, temporal changes
> and other coupled systems are not illustrated in
> Figure 2.2. We discuss temporal changes in many
> other chapters in this book and explicitly discuss
> other coupled systems in Chapters 16 and 17.
> Local Residents include socioeconomic and demo-
> graphic characteristics (e.g., household size, age and
> gender structure, family formation through marriage,
> migration, death, income, expenses, perceptions, and
> attitudes).They also include spatial distribution (e.g., location with respect to forest) and activities (e.g., crop and livestock production, exh·action of forest products, or off-farm employment) at multiple organ- izational levels (e.g., individual, household, village, and township). With regard to Forests, important variables consist of forest type (e.g., deciduous, co- niferous, mixed), areal extent, spatial configuration (e.g., continuous or fragmented), and sh·ucture (e.g., understory species such as bamboo, stem density, h·ee canopy cover, and species composition). For- ests are important links between Local Residents and Wildlife. For Wildlife, major attributes include species composition, population dynamics, and the distribution and quality of their habitats. The quality of wildlife habitat depends on biophysical conditions (e.g., topography and forest cover) and the degree and nature of human impacts. Policies (and policy makers) serve an important role in coupled systems as they can alter all other components. Policies could originate from the local, provincial, or national organ- izations or governments. Many of the policies relate to both conservation goals and human livelihoods, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) pro- grams. Contextual Factors include other components and processes inside a coupled system and those in other coupled systems that interact with the focal coupled system. Examples of Contextual Factors include geographic setting, tow-ism, migration, and global economic markets.
> These five components interact with one another (Figure 2.2). Local Residents rely on ecosystem services (Chapter 5) and participate in a variety of activities that affect both Forests and Wildlife (Chapters 6 and 7). Local Residents may extract resources from Forests (e.g., via timber harvest- ing, fuelwood collection, or medicinal herb collec- tion) or participate in forest monitoring to prevent such extraction. Local Residents may also influence Forests by raising livestock, which may overgraze the understory or trample tree seedlings. Changes that occur in Forests as a result of such actions in turn indirectly impact Wildlife via changes in the structure and function of their available habitat. Local Residents may also directly impact wildlife via hunting, and Wildlife can affect forests through grazing and reducing regeneration of plants. Pol- icies influence characteristics of Local Residents,
> Forests, and Wildlife by restricting human activ- ities. These influences can be direct (e.g., prevent- ing timber extraction and fuelwood collection, and spurring tree planting) or indirect (e.g., incentives to use alternatives to fuelwood, such as electricity and natural gas). Contextual Factors influence all other components because they can result in Lo- cal Residents leaving the system (e.g., for work in cities), which could benefit both Forests and Wildlife. Alternatively, Contextual Factors such as tourism run by outside companies can increase negative impacts on both Forests and Wildlife by converting Forests and Wildlife habitat into roads and other tourism infrastructures (e.g., hotels and restaurants).
> Feedbacks can arise in a number of ways. For example, as Forests near residents shrink, they be- come more distant from Local Residents, which makes the extraction of timber and non-timber for- est products more difficult and time-consuming. Policies can constitute a negative feedback on the conversion of Forests by discouraging deforest- ation and actively promoting the conversion of farmland to forest. Increases in human-wildlife conflicts (e.g., crop predation) can emerge from successful wildlife conservation. Policies may ei- ther further enhance or deter their own success depending on whether Local Residents receive benefits to offset such costs. An increase in avail- able labor after conversion of farmland to forest can encourage out-migration (a Contextual Factor), which could further reduce farming and direct im- pacts on Forests.
> The relationships between different components are complex. For instance, the relationship between changes in Forests and changes in Wildlife habi- tat may be non-linear because some forested areas are not necessarily suitable wildlife habitat. Local Residents may respond to conservation Policies in a non-linear way, such that increasing benefits could disproportionally increase participation in con- servation. The relationship between some compo- nents may take a long time to appear, constituting a time lag. For example, a time lag may occur when changes in the fertility rate of Local Residents affect Forests after a delay of years or even decades (An et al., 2011) until children grow up and establish new households.

> # Chapter 2 Summary: Framing Sustainability of Coupled Human and Natural Systems
> 
> This chapter by Jianguo Liu, Vanessa Hull, Neil Carter, Andres Vina, and Wu Yang focuses on the concept of the Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS), and how it has gained importance in understanding and addressing global sustainability challenges.
> 
> The authors identify that human-nature interactions have grown in scope and intensity since the Industrial Revolution. This increase in interaction is particularly notable in recent decades due to population growth and increased consumption. The frequency of large-scale human-nature interactions has become faster, impacting every corner of earth and crossing planetary boundaries. This has led to the prominent vulnerability of both human and natural systems, and it has stemmed largely from historical human-centered views of conquering and freely using nature.
> 
> However, traditional human-dominant perspectives can't sustain life-supporting systems and hence, a shift is required. The necessity to sustain natural systems while allowing human prosperity is deemed as one of the world's most critical challenges. Sustainable development has been widely accepted as a concept but its practical implementation has lagged due to limited understanding of the complex relationships between humans and nature.
> 
> The Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) concept has emerged in response to this lack of understanding and represents a system in which human and natural components interact. The authors emphasize on reciprocal interactions and feedbacks, detailing how human impacts on nature are also influenced by nature's impacts on humans.
> 
> The chapter illustrates the CHANS concept using an example of a rural forest setting that includes five key components: local residents, policies, forests, wildlife, and contextual factors. It's explained how these components interact and feedback on each other. 
> 
> Finally, the chapter concludes by stating that this theorized framework can effectively be applied to a variety of specific types of coupled human and natural systems. This approach can provide invaluable insights into understanding the constraints and consequences of human activities and developing more sustainable practices.
