> I am preparing my external dossier for tenure review, and I would like edits to improve the text as well as the identification of any gaps. I will provide the sections of this one-at-a-time. This is the Highlights and selected papers in my personal statement.
> 
> First, here is a description of my writing style:
> General Features of Your Voice
> 
> Structured and Organized: Across all texts, your thoughts are consistently well-structured and arranged. This is evident in how you build and sequence your ideas. "Will farmers be able to adapt? Or are the details of effective farming too complicated, so that it will take decades to find the right new practices and seeds, by which time the climate will have changed again? This is a fundamental question for the future of food security globally and the livelihoods of millions of farmers..."
> 
> Narrative and Contextual: You have a knack for storytelling and embedding your message within a broader context. "Rising is your family name, reaching back along your male line to the first Rising who came over to America from England (by way of London) in 1635."
> 
> Clear and Concise: You have a strong command of language that allows you to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. "So how quickly have farmers reduced the impact of high temperatures? Unfortunately, very slowly. Reducing the damages by 10% takes about 40 years."
> 
> Respectful and Considerate: In all your texts, you maintain a respectful and considerate tone. You make efforts to clarify, explain, and provide insights while acknowledging the complexity of the topics you discuss. "The concept of equity is necessarily tied up in distribution and power, and cannot be separated from the context in which it is deployed. Yet this context is often not explicitly stated, leading to confusion and miscommunication."
> 
> Use of both long, complex sentences and shorter, more direct sentences.
> 
> In academic papers, your writing becomes more formal and analytical. You adopt a more professional tone and use specialized language specific to the field of study. You frequently use citations and discuss theoretical constructs in detail, demonstrating scholarly rigor. "An alternative explanation, which I call the Inequality of Outcomes hypothesis, is that the increase in emissions per person is itself causing inequality, through feedback loops in the economic system."
