> Dear Dr. Rising,
> I am Donald Ugochukwu Chukwumaeze, currently a lecturer at the Department of Economics, University of Calabar, Nigeria, with research interests in fishery economics, climate change impacts, and sustainability of coastal fisheries.
> I recently read your 2024 paper presentation at the Ocean Sciences Meeting (with Nandini Ramesh and Kimberly Lai Oremus), i.e., “climate change impacts on fishery productivity through the disruption of cross-boundary flows.” I was particularly drawn to your findings. My current research, which focuses on the intersection of climate change and coastal fishery productivity, overlaps with yours, and I would love to build on this under your mentorship to explore new scientific findings using a combination of climate econometrics, remote sensing, and geospatial methodologies.
> I am preparing my application to the PhD program in Environmental Economics for Fall 2026 and would like to ask if you are currently accepting new doctoral students. 
> I admire your contributions to research on climate change impacts and coastal fishery productivity, and would be honored to learn under your guidance. Thank you for your time and consideration.
