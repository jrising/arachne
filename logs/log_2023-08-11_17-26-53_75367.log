> Description: Construction, operation, and decommissioning of offshore wind turbines.
> Current Status: Active consideration and likely construction but may conflict with particular habitats and marine routes.
> Spatial Extent: Ocean, specific sites not directly mentioned.
> Temporal Pattern: Long term, with construction, operation, decommissioning phases, beyond the near-term for deeper sites.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Increased expansion towards deeper waters with floating turbine technology. May influence marine species habitats and migratory routes.
> Stakeholders: Offshore wind energy companies, environmental organizations, local/federal government, nearby communities.
> Sources: Report itself, ARA recommendation.
> Notes: Potential reductions in CO2 emissions are a positive long-term benefit.
> Endangered, Threatened, and Protected
> 
> Description: Species that may be affected by offshore wind development.
> Current Status: Protected under wildlife protection laws focusing on population level.
> Spatial Extent: Throughout the marine environment.
> Temporal Pattern: Ongoing, potential effects from wind development over time of project.
> Potential Expansion/Changes: Increase in impacts if wind development expands.
> Stakeholders: Environmental organizations, government (via NOAA), local/federal government.
