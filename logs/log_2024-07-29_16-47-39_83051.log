> This code assumes that the necessary additional packages (e.g., `BusinessDays`, `Test`, and `DataFrames`) are already installed and that `CALENDARS` is appropriately defined beforehand. The unit test checks both the `is_peak` and `get_retail_price` functions for various edge cases.
**user**:
> I should probably split the unit test and the plotting code out from the functions. What's a good way to organize the files in a project? I'll have many other such files to do this with.
**assistant**:
> Organizing your Julia project for clarity and maintainability is a great idea, especially as you accumulate more files and functionality. Here's a suggested directory structure to help you keep everything tidy:
> 
> ```
> your_project/
> ├── src/
> │   ├── main.jl                # Main file to run your project
> │   ├── functions.jl           # Contains your core functions (e.g., is_peak, get_retail_price)
> │   ├── utils.jl               # Helper functions or utilities, if needed
> ├── tests/
> │   ├── test_functions.jl       # Unit tests for your functions
> │   └── test_utils.jl           # Unit tests for utilities, if you have any
> ├── plots/
> │   ├── plot_retail_price.jl    # Separate file for plotting code
> └── Project.toml                # Project dependencies and metadata
> ```
> 
> ### Breakdown of the Structure:
> 
> - **`src/`**: This directory contains your main source code.
>   - `main.jl`: The entry point of your project where you can call your functions and integrate everything.
>   - `functions.jl`: Place your `is_peak` and `get_retail_price` functions here to keep the logic separate from other functionalities.
> 
> - **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests for your functions and any other components.
>   - `test_functions.jl`: Include your unit tests for the core functionalities. This way, you can easily run them as a separate suite.
>   - `test_utils.jl`: If you create any utility functions over time, you can write tests for them in this file.
> 
> - **`plots/`**: Keeps your plotting code organized.
>   - `plot_retail_price.jl`: This file can contain code that handles all the plotting functionality related to your project, allowing for easy adjustments and enhancements.
> 
> - **`Project.toml`**: This file is critical in Julia projects as it tracks dependencies and project metadata.
> 
> ### Additional Tips:
> 
> - **Modular Design**: As your project grows, consider whether certain functions can be grouped into modules. This adds further structure.
> 
> - **Documentation**: Besides docstrings in your code, consider using a documentation generator like Documenter.jl to create formatted documentation for your project.
> 
> - **Version Control**: Use Git or another version control system to track changes and collaborate effectively.
> 
> With this structure, you'll find it easier to manage larger projects, keep your code organized, and make it understandable to others (or to yourself in the future).
**user**:
> Maybe the `plots` should be `scripts`? Or something else that makes it not quite so specific?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely! Renaming the `plots` directory to something more general, like `scripts`, is a great idea. This can encompass not only plotting code but also any other scripts you might need for analysis, data processing, or other tasks in the future. Here’s how the revised structure would look:
> 
> ```
> your_project/
> ├── src/
> │   ├── main.jl                # Main file to run your project
> │   ├── functions.jl           # Contains your core functions (e.g., is_peak, get_retail_price)
> │   ├── utils.jl               # Helper functions or utilities, if needed
> ├── tests/
> │   ├── test_functions.jl       # Unit tests for your functions
> │   └── test_utils.jl           # Unit tests for utilities, if you have any
> ├── scripts/
> │   ├── plot_retail_price.jl    # Script for plotting code
> │   ├── analyze_data.jl         # Other analysis scripts can go here
> │   └── process_data.jl         # Data processing scripts can be added here
> └── Project.toml                # Project dependencies and metadata
> ```
> 
> ### Breakdown of the Revised Structure:
> 
> - **`src/`**: Remains the same, holding your core functionality.
> - **`tests/`**: Also remains intact for testing your functions.
> - **`scripts/`**: A flexible directory for any scripts that perform tasks, whether that’s plotting, data analysis, or preprocessing.
>   - `plot_retail_price.jl`: For plotting specific data (like retail prices).
>   - `analyze_data.jl`: For any general analysis, like summarizing data, calculating metrics, etc.
>   - `process_data.jl`: For any scripts that handle cleaning, formatting, or preparing your data.
> 
> ### Advantages:
> 
> - **Flexibility**: The `scripts` directory allows you to add a variety of functionality without needing to create new specific directories later on.
> - **Clarity**: It conveys a clear purpose that encompasses multiple tasks while maintaining a clean structure.
> 
> Feel free to adapt the naming and organization further to match your workflow preferences!
