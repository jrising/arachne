**assistant**:
> The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the result of `argmin(values, dims=1)` is indeed a 1xC matrix, but Julia's broadcasting system requires the dimensions to match exactly when filling a subarray.
> 
> In this case, you can simplify the code by ensuring that the dimensions match perfectly. Since `argmin(values, dims=1)` gives a 1xC matrix, you should strip the dimensions to match the shape of `strat[:, Fi]`, which is a 1D array of length `C`. You can do this by reshaping the result or using the appropriate `vec` function.

**user**:
> vec(...) doesn't work because argmin gives objects of type `CartesianIndex(1, X)` for some number X. But I actually just want integers. How can I get integers rather than this CartesianIndex thing?
**assistant**:
> To extract integers from the `CartesianIndex` objects returned by `argmin`, you can access the `.I` field of each `CartesianIndex` object. This field contains the indices as a tuple. Since you know you're working with a 1xC array, you can directly extract the integer index from the `CartesianIndex` objects.

> Here's how you can modify your code to extract integers from the `CartesianIndex` objects:

> 
> In this updated code snippet, `eachcol(argmin(values, dims=1))` returns an iterator over the columns of the result of `argmin`, which are `CartesianIndex(1, X)` objects. We then extract the first element of the tuple using `ind.I[1]` to get the integer index for each column, and populate `strat[:, Fi]` with these integers.
