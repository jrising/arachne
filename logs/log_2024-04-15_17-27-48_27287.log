> I am making a baked gnocchi dish, but replacing the squash with mushrooms. The recipe tells me to bake the squash 15 minutes, then add water and gnocchi and bake another 10 (and then another 7 - 9 after adding spinach). But with the mushrooms, should I shorten the time or otherwise change the plan?
**assistant**:
> Mushrooms do not take as long to cook as squash does. They release water and soften fairly quickly, so it's best to adjust the cooking time to prevent overcooking them. Overcooked mushrooms become rubbery and lose some of their flavor.
> 
> Here's how you can modify your recipe:
> 
> 1. Skip the initial 15 minutes bake for squash.
> 2. Instead, add the mushrooms in the same step you add the gnocchi and water, making sure the mushroom pieces are not too small as they will shrink during cooking. Bake for the prescribed 10 minutes.
> 3. Proceed with the addition of spinach and bake for another 7-9 minutes.
> 
> This should ensure that the mushrooms are cooked well without becoming overdone. Remember to stir the dish a couple of times during baking to distribute heat and flavour evenly.
