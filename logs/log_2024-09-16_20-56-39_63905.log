>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
>    or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
>    prospective students.
>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> Dear Prof. Rising,
> I hope this email finds you well. My name is Samuel Kwame Dassi. I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics with Economics from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana, with a first-class CGPA of 3.6/4.0 in August 2023. I am writing to express my desire to pursue a PhD in Environmental Economics at the School of Marine Science and Policy, University of Delaware, under your supervision.
> 
> My academic background has provided a strong foundation in both Mathematics and Economics, and I have supplemented this with self-directed learning in data science and analytics. My undergraduate project, which focused on neural network parameter estimation for COVID-19 in Ghana, exposed me to the prospects of utilizing data-driven models to address complex environmental challenges such as climate change. This experience has deepened my interest in exploring how data can be applied to environmental and resource management issues, particularly in response to the effects of climate change and human activities
> 
> Ghana, like many African nations, is grappling with environmental instability due to climate change, with challenges such as dry spells, illegal mining, deforestation, water pollution, and threats to food security and price stability. I am eager to explore how Ghana and the broader African continent can mitigate these risks through data-driven and researched-backed decision-making, and I believe your research on climate change impacts and modeling of social-environmental systems aligns perfectly with my goals.
> 
> I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my research interests and the possibility of joining your team as a PhD student. Thank you for considering me as I work on submitting my application. I have attached my CV and transcript for your review, and I look forward to your response.
