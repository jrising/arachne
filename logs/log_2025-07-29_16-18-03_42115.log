**assistant**:
> The terms "annualized" and "amortized" are both used in finance, but they refer to different concepts:
> 
> 1. **Annualized**: This term refers to converting a rate or return into an annual rate. It provides a way to compare figures that aren't measured over a year to an equivalent annual basis. For example, if you have a monthly return of 1%, you could annualize it to show what the return would be if that 1% were compounded each month for a year. This allows for easier comparison between returns or rates that are measured over different periods.
> 
> 2. **Amortized**: This involves spreading the cost of an expense or payment over a period of time. Amortization is commonly used for loans, where payments consist of both principal and interest, and these payments are spread out over the duration of the loan. Each payment reduces the principal balance and covers the interest cost, with the aim of fully repaying the loan by the end of its term. Amortization can also apply to intangible assets, where the asset's cost is incrementally expensed over its useful life.
> 
> In essence, "annualized" is about standardizing rates over a year for comparison, while "amortized" is about distributing costs or payments over time.
