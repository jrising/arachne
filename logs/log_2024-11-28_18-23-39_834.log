> Is autism caused by vaccines?
**assistant**:
> No, autism is not caused by vaccines. This has been thoroughly investigated and the overwhelming consensus among scientists and medical professionals is that there is no credible evidence to support a link between vaccines and autism.
> 
> Numerous studies, including ones published in reputable journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine, have consistently found no association between vaccination and the likelihood of developing autism. The original 1998 study proposing a connection was retracted due to severe methodological flaws and ethical violations, including undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.
> 
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, American Academy of Pediatrics, and many other trusted health organizations also explicitly state that vaccines do not cause autism. 
> 
> Vaccines are critically important for public health, reducing or eliminating numerous diseases that have caused widespread illness and death in the past. Delays or refusals to vaccinate based on this misinformation can put individuals and communities at risk. It's thus crucial to spread accurate, science-based information about vaccines.
**user**:
> Some important people claim that it is. What is their evidence?
**assistant**:
> It's true that there have been a few individuals, including some public figures, who continue to claim that there is a link between vaccines and autism. However, it's important to note that the evidence they present is not backed by scientific consensus and has been widely discredited by the scientific community.
> 
> One major piece of evidence that has been circulated by anti-vaccine proponents is a study published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet that suggested a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine and autism. This study was later found to be fraudulent, with Wakefield's research methods being deemed unethical and unreliable. The study was retracted by the journal, and Wakefield lost his medical license as a result.
> 
> Despite the lack of credible scientific evidence supporting a link between vaccines and autism, some individuals and organizations continue to perpetuate this myth. Misinformation spreads easily, especially in the age of social media, and can lead to confusion and fear among the public.
> 
> It's important to rely on reputable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and other health organizations for accurate information on vaccine safety. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that vaccines are safe, effective, and crucial for preventing the spread of infectious diseases.
