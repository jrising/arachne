> I want to do parallel processing in R, to use all my CPUs. My problem is fully parallelizable, but each item is slow to compute and can sometimes fail, so I want to get results as they become available. Let's say that I have a list of objects to process, and a slow function that processes them, and returns some number of rows of a data frame. How can I get to eventually having the full dataframe, without using something like mclapply which won't give me any data until everything is done.
**assistant**:
> Parallel processing in R can be done via the `parallel` package, which has its own version of `lapply` known as `mclapply` (it stands for multi-core lapply). However, as you correctly pointed out, `mclapply` will block until all workers are done and you wouldn't get real-time outputs.
> 
> So, for your case I would suggest a solution that uses the `future` and `furrr` packages, along with `as_iterator`. Here's a brief overview of how you could set this up:
> 
> 1. Install the required packages using `install.packages("future", "furrr")` and then load them with `library(future)`, `library(furrr)`.
> 
> 2. Use `plan(multiprocess)` to set up parallel processing.
> 
> 3. Map over your data in parallel using `future_map_dfr()`, progressively saving your results out to a data frame with `as_iterator`.
> 
> Here's some example code using an example function `slow_function`:
> 
> ```R
> # Load the necessary libraries
> library(future)
> library(furrr)
> 
> # Set up for multiprocessing
> plan(multiprocess)
> 
> # Define a slow function
> slow_function <- function(x) {
>   Sys.sleep(1) # simulate a slow function

> 
> # Create a list of objects to process
> objects <- list(1,2,3,4,5)
> 
> # Iterate over the objects in parallel, getting results progressively
> results <- future_map_dfr(as_iterator(objects), ~slow_function(.x))
> 
> print(results)
> ```
> 
> This code will start processing your tasks in parallel using all available cores of your machine. When using `future_map_dfr()` as an iterator, it will return response iteratively so that you can start working with parts of the result as soon as they're available.
> 
> However, please remember to handle errors because if a task fails, the error would terminate everything unless it is caught. You could use `safely()` function to make your function fail-safe.
**user**:
> I'm currently using futures, but I occasionally get an error-- the process no longer exists-- and besides, it would take weeks to get through everything. I think I need each object's process to write its own results to a file, so I can combine them later. Does that make sense?
**assistant**:
> If you are encountering issues with the process terminating unexpectedly and need a way to save intermediate results to combine later, writing results to individual files for each object processed in parallel is a feasible approach. This way, even if a process fails or terminates abruptly, you would have the partial results saved to disk for later combination.
> 
> Here's a modified version of the code that writes the results of each object to a separate file:
> 
> ```R
> # Load the necessary libraries
> library(future)
> library(furrr)
> 
> # Set up for multiprocessing
> plan(multiprocess)
> 
> # Define a slow function
> slow_function <- function(x) {
>   Sys.sleep(1) # simulate a slow function
>   result <- data.frame(value = x, sqrt_value = sqrt(x))
>   write.csv(result, file = paste0("result_", x, ".csv")) # Write result to a file
> }
> 
> # Create a list of objects to process
> objects <- list(1,2,3,4,5)
> 
> # Process each object in parallel and write results to individual files
> future_map(as_iterator(objects), ~slow_function(.x))
> 
> # You can combine the results later by reading the files back in and merging them
> ```
> 
> In this modified code snippet, each object's process will write its results to a separate CSV file with a naming convention like "result_X.csv". Later, you can combine these individual result files by reading them back in and merging them into a single data frame as needed.
> 
> This approach should help you circumvent the issue of losing all progress if a process fails and allow you to gradually accumulate results that can be combined at a later stage.
**user**:
> Is there any point to using future_map rather than mclapply in this case? Which is better?
**assistant**:
> In this case where you want to write results to individual files for each object processed in parallel and subsequently combine them, using `future_map` or `mclapply` may not significantly impact the outcome as both can achieve your goal. However, there are some considerations you can keep in mind when deciding between the two:
> 
> **`future_map`:**
> 
> 1. **Asynchronous Processing:** `future_map` allows for more asynchronous processing compared to `mclapply`, which means that it can continue execution even if some futures fail or take longer without blocking the main process.
> 
> 2. **Flexibility:** With `future_map`, you have more flexibility in choosing the backend for processing (e.g., multicore, multisession, etc.) and can easily switch between them.
> 
> 3. **Error Handling:** `future_map` provides more robust error-handling mechanisms through the use of `future_map_safe` or `future_map_results`.
> 
> **`mclapply`:**
> 
> 1. **Simplicity:** `mclapply` is a simpler high-level function compared to setting up futures explicitly.
> 
> 2. ** Stability:** `mclapply` may be more stable in some cases where you don't need the advanced features of `future`.
> 
> In your case, where you are writing results to individual files for each object and planning to combine them later, both `future_map` and `mclapply` would be suitable choices. If you require more control over asynchronous processing, error handling, or different backends for parallel processing, `future_map` might offer more functionality and flexibility. On the other hand, if simplicity and stability are more important factors for your workflow, `mclapply` could be a more straightforward solution.
> 
> Ultimately, the choice between `future_map` and `mclapply` would depend on your specific requirements regarding error handling, asynchronous processing, and overall ease of use in your workflow.
**user**:
> How would I use the future package if I need to determine which objects need to be run-- like, I have a loop that generates objects to be run. Should I run that all first, and then pass that to future_map, or can I let future put everything in a queue and do the work as CPUs become available?
**assistant**:
> If you have a loop that generates objects to be processed in parallel and you want to determine which objects need to be run dynamically, you can let the `future` package handle the queuing of tasks and the dynamic allocation of those tasks to available CPUs. This can be achieved using the `future::future()` function within your loop to generate tasks as needed and submit them for parallel processing on-the-fly.
> 
> Here is a general outline of how you could implement this approach:
> 
> 1. **Set up for parallel processing:** Use `plan(multiprocess)` to set up for parallel processing.
> 
> 2. **Dynamically generate tasks:** Use a loop to generate objects that need processing and use `future::future()` to submit each task to the queue.
> 
> 3. **Process tasks in parallel:** The tasks will be processed in parallel on available CPUs as they become available.
> 
> 4. **Combine results:** If necessary, combine the results at the end once all tasks are completed.
> 
> Here is a simplified example to demonstrate this approach:
> 
> ```r
> library(future)
> plan(multiprocess)
> 
> # Function that simulates processing a task 
> process_task <- function(x) {
>   Sys.sleep(1) # Simulate some processing time
>   return(data.frame(value = x, sqrt_value = sqrt(x)))
> }
> 
> # Generate tasks dynamically
> tasks <- lapply(1:10, function(i) {
>   future({
>     result <- process_task(i)
>     write.csv(result, file = paste0("result_", i, ".csv"))
>   })
> })
> 
> # Wait for all tasks to finish
> vapply(tasks, value, numeric(1))
> 
> # Combine results as needed
> # For example, read in the individual files and merge them into a single data frame
> ```
> 
> In this example, the loop generates tasks dynamically using `lapply` and `future::future()`. Each task is submitted to the queue for parallel processing. The `vapply()` function is used to trigger the processing and wait for all tasks to finish. You can then combine the results as needed, such as reading in the individual files and merging them into a single data frame.
> 
> By using this approach, you can dynamically generate and submit tasks for parallel processing as they are generated, allowing for flexible workload management and optimized utilization of available CPUs.
**user**:
> When you call future, what information does it save about that moment in time? If I update a variable in the environment, will that get read in the updated form in the other process?
**assistant**:
> When you create a future using the `future()` function in R, it captures the state of the environment at that point in time. This includes the values of variables and objects in the global environment where the `future()` call is made. 
> 
> However, if you update a variable in the global environment after the `future()` call has been made, the updated value of that variable won't automatically be reflected in the future or in any processes that were created from that future. 
> 
> This is due to the way R implements parallel processing with the `future` package. Each future essentially has its own isolated environment and doesn't share mutable state with the parent R process or other futures. 
> 
> If you need to pass specific information or variables to a future, you can explicitly pass them as arguments to the function you plan to execute asynchronously within the future. This ensures that the function inside the future has access to the most up-to-date values of the variables it needs to operate on. 
> 
> Here's a simple example to illustrate this concept:
> 
> ```r
> library(future)
> plan(multiprocess)
> 
> # Define a variable
> my_variable <- 5
> 
> # Define a function that uses the variable
> process_variable <- function(x) {
>   return(x * 2)
> }
> 
> # Create a future with the function and pass the variable as an argument
> future_result <- future(process_variable(my_variable))
> 
> # Get the result of the future
> result <- value(future_result)
> 
> print(result)  # This will print 10
> ```
> 
> In this example, `my_variable` is passed as an argument to the function `process_variable` within the future, ensuring that the future operates on the current value of `my_variable` when it is executed. 
> 
> By passing variables explicitly as arguments to functions within futures, you can ensure that the functions operate on the most up-to-date values of those variables.
**user**:

> future({
>   do something
> })
> How should I stop execution within `do something`? Do I use 'return'?
**assistant**:
> In a setup where you are running asynchronous code within a `future` call in R, if you need to stop the execution of the code within the block labeled as "do something", you can indeed use `return` to exit the block and return a value if needed.
> 
> Here is an example to illustrate this:
> 
> ```r
> library(future)
> plan(multiprocess)
> 
> # Define a function with some logic that may need to stop execution
> my_function <- function(x) {
>   print("Starting processing...")
>   
>   if (x < 0) {
>     print("Stopping execution because x is negative.")
>     return(NULL) # Use return to exit the function
>   }
>   
>   # Continue with more processing
>   print("Continuing processing...")
>   return(x * 2)
> }
> 
> # Create a future with the function inside
> future_result <- future({
>   my_function(10) # Call the function with x = 10
> })
> 
> # Get the result of the future
> result <- value(future_result)
> 
> print(result)  # This will print the result of my_function(10)
> ```
> 
> In this example, if the condition `x < 0` is true, the code block within the `future` will exit early when `return(NULL)` is encountered. This will stop the execution within the future and return `NULL` as the result.
> 
> By using `return`, you can control the flow of execution within the asynchronous code block in a `future` call and exit early if needed.
**user**:
> Within a setup like
> future({

> })
> How should I stop execution within `do something`? Do I use 'return'?r
**assistant**:
> In R, if you want to stop the execution of code within a `future` call, you can use the `stop()` function to halt the execution and return an error message. This will trigger an error condition within the future task and stop further execution within the block.
> 
> Here is an example illustrating how you can use `stop()` within a `future` call:
> 
> ```r
> library(future)
> plan(multiprocess)
> 
> # Define a function with some logic that may need to stop execution
> my_function <- function(x) {
>   print("Starting processing...")
> 
>   if (x < 0) {
>     stop("Stopping execution because x is negative.")
>   }
> 
>   # Continue with more processing
>   print("Continuing processing...")

>   print(result)  # This will print the result of my_function(10)

>   cat("An error occurred: ", conditionMessage(e), "\n")
> })
> ```
> 
> In this example, if the condition `x < 0` is true, the `stop()` function will be called, halting the execution of the code inside the `future` and triggering an error message. The `tryCatch()` block is used to catch and handle errors that occur during the evaluation of the `future`.
> 
> By using `stop()`, you can effectively stop the execution within a `future` call and signal that an error condition has occurred.
