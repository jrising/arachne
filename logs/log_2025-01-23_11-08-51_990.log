> What topic is the RFP addressing? If multiple topics, describe all of them.
> 2026 DC Net Zero Energy Code Implementation (commercial and residential) via the DOE Resilient
> Energy Codes Implementation (RECI) FOA. DE-FOA-0002813 lists the following priorities:
> • Implementation
> • Equity
> • Partnerships
> • Compliance
> • Innovative approaches
> The intention of this work is to change the way the Energy Code is updated in the District of Columbia,
> starting with the 2026 version, to be flexible while ambitious. New Buildings Institute (NBI) is the lead.
> Partners include DOEE, Steven Winter Assoc, Montgomery County MD, and others. The team’s response
> will include work to:
> • Write technical code requirements and quantify the associated costs/benefits.
> • Directly engage building industry stakeholders, community groups, and policy makers.
> • Identify gaps in regional resources, engagement, and enforcement.
> • Align DC’s new construction/major renovation code + BEPS + renewable energy standards + grid
> responsiveness strategies.
> • Align DC + regional code approaches: through collaboration, neighboring jurisdictions leverage
> this as core content and process for their future updates.
> • Support code enforcement and industry resource creation (FAQs, training, etc).
> IMT’s role in this effort will be led by the Building Innovation Hub and include:
> • Building industry stakeholder (building owners, developers, managers, designers, contractors,
> etc) outreach and engagement
> • Identify community engagement (CE) partners
> • Collaborate with CE partners on outreach and engagement with community groups
> • Co-facilitate a standing task force, and possibly focused subgroups, throughout the development
> process
> For refence, concept paper and full FOA are here.
> Funding Level, Proposal Schedule, Start Date, Duration, Difficulty
> If provided in RFP:
> What is the amount of funding available? $45M (individual awards vary from $500,000 - $10,000,000)
> When are proposals due? 3/27
> When would work start if we win? Likely early October.
> How long will the work last? 1-5 years
> How difficult do you think it would be to write the proposal? (Examples: Easy, a few hours for one
> person; Super hard, multiple people for more than a week, etc.) Medium: we are not prime, but we
> need to identify and collaborate with partners who will lead community engagement. And co-lead
> overall outreach and facilitation strategy.
> Problem
> Describe what problem/barrier/need the RFP is addressing. In theory, this should tie directly to the
> preceding topic description. If it doesn’t, explain where you see the discrepancy.
> The District and the DC metro region have ambitious building carbon reduction and renewable energy
> targets. They also have various new construction green building and energy codes, renewable portfolio
> standards, and existing building regulations. It has also been recognized that the current codes + BEPS
> were not co-created with community and building industry. This funding is an opportunity to 1) change
> the code creation process in DC, 2) ensure new construction code updates, and the process used to
> make the updates, are aligned with other regulations and building-related goals, and 3) use the resulting
> process as a model for the region.
> Mission/Strategy/Business Alignment
> Does the proposed concept fit clearly within IMT’s mission and does it align with IMT’s Strategic and
> Operational Plan? If not, why should it be considered? Is it a business (i.e. revenue generating)
> opportunity? Feel free to make a case.
> Yes, this concept seeks to change the way energy code is developed in the region (and, possibly more
> broadly) by using the District as a model.
> Market Transformation
> Is there a market transformation aspect to the RFP? State yes or no. If yes, describe how the impact of
> the project goes beyond the immediate work required. Is it scalable? Replicable?
> Yes, this concept seeks to change the way energy code is developed in the region (and, possibly more
> broadly) by using the District as a model.
> IMT Qualifications, Capacity and Capabilities
> Is IMT well positioned to work on this topic? Is it a field in which we already have a solid reputation? Do
> we currently have the skills and capacity to do the work? If not, what would we need to add? Are other
> organizations or groups doing this type of work already?
> IMT was sought out to participate in this project due to our BPS experience and the Hub’s local industry
> convening skills.
> Partners
> List critical organizations we would partner with for this proposal, the role they will play and their
> importance to achieving success. If the need for a partner has been identified but the organization
> hasn’t been selected, just describe the role we need.
> New Buildings Institute
> District of Columbia Department of Energy and the Environment
> Maryland Department of Labor
> Montgomery County Department of Permitting Services
> Delaware DNREC Division of Climate, Coastal and Energy
> Steven Winter Associates Inc.
> Performance Systems Development Consulting
> Building Innovation Hub
> Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships
> Community Engagement (answer all that you can or state where you are unsure):
> • Who are you trying to reach with your community engagement?
> o District residents, building owners and developers, small businesses, tenants,
> community groups, community advocacy organizations
> • What are the challenges and obstacles that you are facing with your community engagement or
> what obstacle do you expect to face?
> o DC’s energy code and BEPS, though they had some stakeholder engagement in the past,
> are not community-led or co-created. This will be the first time approaching a code
> redevelopment cycle in this way. It is new for most DC DOEE staff. Typically, the extent
> of stakeholder involvement has been through the public comment period, and limited
> staff presentations. This proposal will be a much-expanded scope, timeline, and process
> to what DC is used to.
> • What changes because the community is involved in this process?
> o Hopefully the code itself, the implementation timeline, resources, and enforcement.
> • What processes and avenues need to be established or changed to get community involvement?
> o We need to build community trust, engage on-the-ground community leaders, facilitate
> partnerships with community AND building industry
> • How does the community benefit from this process?
> o I hope it results in a code that puts community priorities and needs on equal footing
> with that of the larger building developers/owners. The resulting code factors
> community priorities from the beginning.
> • Have you already identified a community partner?
> o No. That needs to happen as soon as (if) this is approved. We have some ideas, but need
> to engage asap.
> • What are your initial plans (who are you talking to or will talk to, what does outreach look like,
> what is the ask, what is your timeline, etc)?
> o See above
> • How will you measure and define success in this project?
> Administrative/Contracting Considerations
> Strategic Services (Betsy) must review the RFP and state whether there are issues of concern. The types
> of things that might be mentioned here are overly burdensome contracting or reporting requirements,
> past problems in contracting with the entity issuing the RFP, onerous cost-share requirements, etc.
> Miscellaneous
> Is this lobbying? No.
> Are matching funds required? No.
> If so, can we leverage existing funding sources?
> Should we write a proposal?
> In your opinion, should we bid on this RFP? What are the pluses and minuses for us as an organization?
> Yes. NBI is the prime. IMT’s role in responding to the proposal is providing a response related to the
> industry engagement component. We will need to coordinate with possible community engagement
> partners and then collaborate on our section of the response. See the “Topic Summary” section above
> for a description of our role.

> The Request for Proposal (RFP) pertains to the "2026 DC Net Zero Energy Code Implementation" for both commercial and residential buildings under the U.S. Department of Energy's Resilient Energy Codes Implementation (RECI) FOA. The aim is to revolutionize the energy code update process in the District of Columbia through a flexible yet ambitious approach led by the New Buildings Institute (NBI). It features priorities of implementation, equity, partnerships, compliance, and innovative approaches. The strategy addresses the issues of co-creating building carbon reduction and renewable energy targets, green building, energy codes, and renewable portfolio standards with both the community and the building industry. Additionally, it aligns the construction code with other regulations and building-related goals to serve as a prototype for the region. 
> 
> Key partners include the District of Columbia Department of Energy and the Environment, Maryland Department of Labor, and others. The Building Innovation Hub of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), who were sought out due to their experience and local industry convening skills, will take significant charge of building industry stakeholder engagement and collaboration with community engagement partners. The total funding available is $45M, with individual awards ranging from $500,000 to $10,000,000. Proposals are due by March 27th, and the work, rated as a medium difficulty task, is set to start in early October and will last from 1 to 5 years. The RFP does not involve lobbying and doesn't require matching funds. The entire initiative seeks to ensure that the community's priorities align with those of big building developers/owners.
