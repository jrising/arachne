> Abstract
> After a long history of overexploitation, increasing efforts to restore marine ecosystems and rebuild fisheries are under way. Here, we analyze current trends from a fisheries and conservation perspective. In 5 of 10 well-studied ecosystems, the average exploitation rate has recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet 63% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions, highlighting the need for a global perspective on rebuilding marine resources.

> Overfishing has long been recognized as a leading environmental and socioeconomic problem in the marine realm and has reduced biodiversity and modified ecosystem functioning (1–3). Yet, current trends as well as future prospects for global fisheries remain controversial (3–5). Similarly, the solutions that hold promise for restoring marine fisheries and the ecosystems in which they are embedded are hotly debated (4–6). Such controversies date back more than a hundred years to the famous remarks of Thomas Huxley on the inexhaustible nature of sea fisheries (7) and various replies documenting their ongoing exhaustion. Although management authorities have since set goals for sustainable use, progress toward curbing overfishing has been hindered by an unwillingness or inability to bear the short-term social and economic costs of reducing fishing (8). However, recent commitments to adopting an ecosystem approach to fisheries may further influence progress because they have led to a reevaluation of management targets for fisheries and the role of managers in meeting broader conservation objectives for the marine environment (9).
> In light of this debate, we strive here to join previously diverging perspectives and to provide an integrated assessment of the status, trends, and solutions in marine fisheries. We explore the prospects for rebuilding depleted marine fish populations (stocks) and for restoring the ecosystems of which they are part. In an attempt to unify our understanding of the global fisheries situation, we compiled and analyzed all available data types, namely global catch data (Fig. 1A), scientific stock assessments, and research trawl surveys (Fig. 1B), as well as data on small-scale fisheries (10). We further used published ecosystem models (Fig. 1B) to evaluate the effects of exploitation on marine communities. Available data sources are organized hierarchically like a Russian doll: Stock assessments provide the finest resolution but represent only a subset of species included in research surveys, which in turn represent only a small subset of species caught globally. These sources need to be interpreted further in light of historical fisheries before data collection and illegal or unreported fisheries operating today (11). We focus on two leading questions: (i) how do changes in exploitation rates impact fish populations, communities, and yields, and (ii) which solutions have proven successful in rebuilding exploited marine ecosystems?

(B) Other data: Stock assessments quantify the status of exploited populations; research trawl surveys are used to estimate fish community trends; ecosystem models are used to assess responses to fishing. Ecosystems that were analyzed in some detail are highlighted in green (not overfished), yellow (low exploitation rate, biomass rebuilding from overfishing), orange (low to moderate exploitation rate, not yet rebuilding), or red (high exploitation rate).

**assistant**:
> The section is from an academic paper discussing the ongoing issue of overexploitation of marine ecosystems and the controversial measures being taken to restore them. The authors note that while there's been a decrease in exploitation rates in certain areas—reaching rates predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield—the majority of fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding. 
> 
> They stress the need for diverse local management actions such as catch restrictions, gear modification, and creation of marine protected areas. The authors also underscore the complexities introduced by international fleets and the lack of alternative sources of income to fishing in poorer regions.
> 
> The progress in combating overfishing has been slow due to reluctance or inability to handle short-term socioeconomic costs of reducing fishing. However, there is hope with recent commitments to adopt an ecosystem approach to fisheries which could transform management goals and roles.
> 
> To provide a comprehensive view on the global fisheries situation, the authors analyze various data types including global catch, scientific stock assessments, trawl surveys, and data on small-scale fisheries. They also use published ecosystem models to evaluate the effects of exploitation on marine communities. The goal of their study is to understand how changes in exploitation rates impact fish populations, communities, and yields, and to identify solutions to rebuild exploited marine ecosystems.
