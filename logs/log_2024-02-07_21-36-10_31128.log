**user**:
> I'm building a model boat. The kit came with 4 glue containers: D3 PVA Fast Setting (a very large container), High viscosity adhesive, Medium viscosity adhesive, and Thin viscosity adhesive (those last three quite small). But the instructions talk about "white (or carpenter's) glue" and "contact (or cobbler's) glue". How should I use them?
**assistant**:
> Given the description of the four glue containers included in your model boat kit, you can associate them with the glues mentioned in the instructions as follows:
> 
> 1. **D3 PVA Fast Setting**: This adhesive is a form of white glue, also known as PVA (Polyvinyl Acetate). It's generally used in carpentry, hence the term "carpenter's glue" in your instructions. This fast-setting variant is useful for quick bonding of larger pieces where you might not want to wait for a long curing time. PVA glues are safe, non-toxic, and easy to clean, they dry clear and bond strongly to wood.
>    
> 2. **High, Medium, and Thin viscosity adhesives**: These are likely representative of your "contact (or cobbler's) glue." Contact adhesive is strong glue used in a variety of applications including boat building. It has to be applied to both surfaces and allowed to dry before the two surfaces are brought into contact. Once they are pressed together, the bond forms very quickly. The different viscosities are used for different tasks, with higher viscosity glues being thicker and better for filling gaps, while thin viscosity glues are excellent for precise applications or where you need the glue to seep into small crevices.
> 
> As for *how to use them*:
> 
> - **D3 PVA Fast Setting**: This type of glue is typically used for larger pieces that have a large surface area for the glue to bond to. You will apply a thin layer to one or both surfaces (apply to both surfaces for a stronger bond), then hold them together until the glue begins to set.
> 
> - **High viscosity adhesive**: Use this for bonding pieces together where there might be a gap or some irregularity in the surfaces. Because it's thicker, it's good for gap-filling. Apply it to both surfaces, let it dry to the point of being tacky, and then press the two pieces together. 
> 
> - **Medium viscosity adhesive**: This adhesive is for general usage. Use it for bonding pieces with fairly good fit and surface alignment. Like the high viscosity adhesive, apply it to both surfaces, let it dry until tacky, and then press the two pieces together.
> 
> - **Thin viscosity adhesive**: This adhesive is best for bonding tightly-fitting pieces together. It's also good for applying on porous material, where it will soak into the pores for a stronger bond. Apply to both surfaces, allow to dry until tacky, then press together.
> 
> Remember to use adhesives in a well-ventilated area and to clean up any excess before it has a chance to dry fully.
