**user**:
> I want to make a regular expression in python. I previously had "r'```python(.*?)```'", but now I want to allow multiple different code languages. The list of code languages is in a `langsallowed` list. And I want to extract out both the language and the enclosed code. How do I do this
**assistant**:
> You can modify your regular expression to dynamically include the languages from the `langsallowed` list. Here's how you can achieve that:
> 
> ```python
> import re
> 
> # Sample list of allowed languages
> langsallowed = ['python', 'javascript', 'java', 'html']
> 
> # Join the list into a single string, separated by the OR operator (`|`)
> langs_pattern = '|'.join(langsallowed)
> 
> # Create a regular expression pattern to match the desired code block
> pattern = rf'```({langs_pattern})\s(.*?)```'
> 
> # Sample text with code blocks
> text = """
> Here is some python code:
> ```python
> print("Hello, world!")
> ```
> 
> And here is some javascript code:
> ```javascript
> console.log("Hello, world!");
> ```
> """
> 
> # Find all code blocks with the specified languages
> matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
> 
> # Output each match
> for language, code in matches:
>     print(f"Language: {language}")
>     print("Code:")
>     print(code)
>     print()  # Add a newline for readability
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation:
> - `langs_pattern` constructs a regular expression pattern using the pipe `|` operator to allow any of the languages in `langsallowed`.
> - The pattern `rf'```({langs_pattern})\s(.*?)```'` is a raw formatted string. It uses:
>   - `({langs_pattern})` to capture the language specified in the backticks.
>   - `\s` to match any whitespace character after the language declaration.
>   - `(.*?)` to capture the code enclosed within the triple backticks. The `?` makes the quantifier lazy, ensuring it captures as little as possible, stopping at the first closing triple backticks.
> - `re.DOTALL` allows the `.` in the regular expression to match newline characters, enabling the capture of multi-line code blocks.
>   
> This regex will extract both the language and the enclosed code for any sections in your specified `langsallowed`.
**user**:
> How do I then get out the language and the code from the matches?
**assistant**:
> To extract the language and the code from the matches using the regular expression we created earlier, you can simply iterate over the results returned by `re.findall`. The matches will be tuples, where the first element is the language and the second element is the corresponding code block. Here's how to do that in Python:
> 
> ```python
> import re
> 
> # Sample list of allowed languages
> langsallowed = ['python', 'javascript', 'java', 'html']
> 
> # Join the list into a single string, separated by the OR operator (`|`)
> langs_pattern = '|'.join(langsallowed)
> 
> # Create a regular expression pattern to match the desired code block
> pattern = rf'```({langs_pattern})\s(.*?)```'
> 
> # Sample text with code blocks
> text = """
> Here is some python code:
> ```python
> print("Hello, world!")
> ```
> 
> And here is some javascript code:
> ```javascript
> console.log("Hello, world!");
> ```
> 
> Now some HTML code:
> ```html
> <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
> ```
> """
> 
> # Find all code blocks with the specified languages
> matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
> 
> # Output each match
> for language, code in matches:
>     print(f"Language: {language}")
>     print("Code:")
>     print(code.strip())  # Use strip to remove leading/trailing whitespace
>     print()  # Add a newline for readability
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation:
> 1. **Regex Matching**: `re.findall` returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the captured groups: (language, code).
>   
> 2. **Iterating Over Matches**: You can loop through each match, unpacking the tuple into `language` and `code`.
> 
> 3. **Output**: Each matched language and its associated code is printed. Calling `strip()` on the code removes any leading or trailing whitespace, making the output cleaner.
> 
> ### Sample Output:
> When the provided code runs with the example text, it will produce an output like this:
> 
> ```
> Language: python
> Code:
> print("Hello, world!")
> 
> Language: javascript
> Code:
> console.log("Hello, world!");
> 
> Language: html
> Code:
> <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
> ```
> 
> This way, you effectively extract both the programming language and the enclosed code from the text.
