**assistant**:
> Yes, you can use the `find` command in Linux to list all directories that are exactly 3 levels deep with the following command:
> 
> ```
> find /path/to/parent/directory -maxdepth 3 -mindepth 3 -type d
> ```
> 
> Here, `/path/to/parent/directory` is the path to the parent directory that you want to search for subdirectories, and `-maxdepth 3` and `-mindepth 3` specify the maximum and minimum depth, respectively. `-type d` specifies that you only want to list directories and not any files.
> 
> This will list all directories that are exactly 3 levels deep under the specified parent directory.
