> This section describes the use of a Present Value cost calculator, incorporating the social cost of carbon as suggested in the Project Appraisal Document, which varied across projects. In cases where a social cost of carbon was not identified, this study assumed 60 dollars per ton of CO2 equivalent for projects approved from 2014 to 2020, and 75 dollars per ton for projects approved from 2021 onward. When the time horizon in the economic analysis was undisclosed, the authors assumed a standard twenty-five-year horizon with five years of implementation, using a 5 percent discount rate if not otherwise provided.

> The section highlights limitations in the data. The study faced representativeness issues for adaptation investments, even though it was the most comprehensive database available for assessing adaptation benefits and returns. Extrapolation of findings is limited by a relatively small sample size in some sectors, especially for projects with fully valued benefits in all three dividends due to:
> 
> 1. The selection of only 12 focus countries, excluding the broader range of developing countries.
> 2. A limited number of adaptation investments per sector and sub-sector available for analysis in each country.
> 3. The triple dividends not being fully identified, and even when identified, rarely being fully valued in rate-of-return analysis. Of 320 projects in AdapTDR, only 27 valued all three dividends.
> 
> This situation is unsurprising since the Triple Dividend of Resilience approach is novel. The database illustrates that the current assessment of full economic benefits from adaptation investments is incomplete, yet adaptation investment Internal Rate of Returns and Benefit-Cost Ratios remain underestimated. Further research is needed to enhance data scope and granularity for evaluating the economic returns of adaptation investments.
> 
> The study's accuracy is also constrained by varied study types and methodological assumptions. Most investments were analyzed using donor Project Appraisal Documents, which undergo internal review but not academic peer review. Variability in definitions, methods, time frames, and discount rates by donors further complicates cost-benefit analyses. Each climate adaptation investment targets a specific risk, but risks are probabilistic. Risk analysis depends on a climate scenario or projected impacts, which aren't standardized in the database and vary by project year and location, as well as underlying assumptions within the same country.
> 
> All database projects are real and approved for investment. Thus, without delving into detailed Return on Investment and Cost-Benefit analysis questions, the database is valuable for documenting actual adaptation investments made in twelve countries, a rarity in investment data even with Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation Plans. While the data search filters are likely to capture nearly all donor-funded projects in these nations, few domestically funded projects appear, and it is unknown to what extent larger countries like Brazil, China, and India have invested in adaptation without donor support. Thus, this database is a list of ongoing adaptation investments but isn’t exhaustive.
