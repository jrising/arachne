> Can a node with constant (non-trainable) weights be embedded in a neural network, such that the NN "learns" to use it?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can include a node (or even a layer) with constant, non-trainable weights in a neural network. This can be done by setting the `trainable` attribute of the corresponding tensors or layers to `False` in many machine learning frameworks. 
> 
> When you do this, the weights in that particular node or layer will not be updated during the backpropagation process. The rest of the network will continue to update its weights based on the output from the non-trainable node(s), "learning" to use the constant features provided by these nodes in conjunction with the trainable features elsewhere in the network.

> However, it's worth noting that doing this effectively reduces the model's capacity to learn from the dataâ€”it removes some of the 'flexibility' of the model. So, it should only be done if you have a specific reason to believe that certain weights should not be updated, such as integrating a known, fixed transformation or function into the network that shouldn't be altered by the learning process.
**user**:
> What is such a layer typicallyed called?
**assistant**:
> A layer with constant, non-trainable weights in a neural network is typically referred to as a "fixed" or "frozen" layer. This terminology signifies that the weights within this layer remain constant and do not change during the training process, effectively making them immutable throughout the training iterations. By designating a layer as "fixed" or "frozen," you instruct the neural network to preserve the specific calculations or transformations encoded within that layer without allowing them to be modified through gradient descent updates.
