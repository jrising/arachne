> The image is a bar chart titled "Number of Projects that Provide IRR vs. Do Not Provide IRR, by Sub-Sector." It compares the number of projects providing internal rate of return (IRR) against those that do not, across various sub-sectors. 
> 
> - The Y-axis represents the number of projects, ranging from 0 to 100.
> - The sub-sectors listed on the X-axis are: Energy, Health, Forestry/Nature, Disaster Risk Management, Water Supply and Sanitation, Resilient Cities, Transport, Water Resources and Flood Management, and Sustainable Agriculture.
> 
> For each sub-sector, there are two bars:
> - A dark blue bar for projects that provide IRR.
> - A dark red bar for projects that do not provide IRR.
> 
> Values are indicated within each bar:
> - Energy: 7 provided, no indication for not provided.
> - Health: 9 not provided, no provided.
> - Forestry/Nature: 13 not provided, no indication for provided.
> - Disaster Risk Management: 16 not provided, no indication for provided.
> - Water Supply and Sanitation: 31 provided, no not provided.
> - Resilient Cities: 33 provided, a small not provided.
> - Transport: 38 provided, small not provided.
> - Water Resources and Flood Management: 47 provided, small not provided.
> - Sustainable Agriculture: 70 provided, large not provided.
> 
> The legend at the bottom shows that dark red represents "Not provided" and dark blue represents "Provided."

> There are several sub-sectors outlined, each showing the number of projects, their share of total projects, and the total cost. Here’s a summary:
> 
> Sustainable Agriculture holds the largest share with 89 projects, accounting for 28 percent of the total, costing 24.2 billion US dollars. Water Resources and Flood Management follow with 56 projects, making up 18 percent, costing 21.9 billion. 
> 
> Resilient cities and urban planning projects, including green infrastructure and urban flooding, total 41 projects, representing 13 percent, and costing 8.1 billion. Transport projects including roads, bridges, waterways, and ports have 39 projects, making up 12 percent, costing 29.9 billion. 
> 
> Water supply and sanitation have 33 projects, accounting for 10 percent, costing 8.6 billion. Health services have 21 projects, accounting for 7 percent, with costs of 27.7 billion. Disaster risk management, along with climate services and early warning systems, include 18 projects, 6 percent of the total, and cost 6.3 billion. 
> 
> Forestry, landscapes, and nature have 16 projects; these make up 5 percent and cost 4.6 billion. Lastly, there are 7 energy projects, covering renewable energy and grid resilience, which make up 2 percent and cost 3 billion.
> 
> Now, about the images on the page:
> 
> The first image is a bar chart titled "Distribution of Projects by Year." This chart shows the number of projects each year from 2010 to 2024. There’s a general increasing trend over the years, with a peak occurring in 2023.
> 
> The second image is another bar chart titled "Number of Projects that Provide IRR vs. Do Not Provide IRR, by Sub-Sector." It illustrates the distribution of projects that provide an internal rate of return versus those that don’t, categorized by sub-sector.
> 
> The sub-sectors are as follows: Energy projects have only provided IRR. Health services did not provide IRR. In Forestry and Nature, projects did not provide IRR. Similarly, Disaster Risk Management projects did not provide IRR. In Water Supply and Sanitation, all projects provided an IRR. 
> 
> In Resilient Cities, while most projects provided IRR, a small number did not. Transport sub-sector mostly provided IRR, with a few not providing. For Water Resources and Flood Management, the majority provided IRR, with some not providing. Lastly, Sustainable Agriculture saw a substantial number of projects both providing and not providing an IRR.
> 
> Dark red in the chart represents projects not providing IRR, and dark blue represents those providing IRR.
