> Estimating Current Climate Losses - Project Proposal
> PI: James Rising, University of Delaware
> 
> Context: The planet has already warmed by 1.34 Â°C [1.2 - 1.5 Â°C], with extensive disruptions now being observed. Under one expert review of global damages, this suggests that climate losses may already be 2.05% of global GDP [0.9 - 3.4%], about $2.2 trillion. In poor, tropical, and agriculturally-dependent countries, current losses are expected to be significantly greater.
> 
> Climate-driven loss and damage will be a central discussion at COP28, taking place in UAE this December. Impacted countries need high-quality estimates of the losses they have already experienced, to demand support from developed countries. A strong basis for developing these estimates exists, in the form of sophisticated statistical models describing the historical relationship between economic growth and weather. These models can be used to attribute existing economic outcomes to climate change.
> 
> Deliverable: This project will develop best-estimates of the current macroeconomic losses from climate change, for each country across the globe. The main outcome will be percent reductions in GDP per capita and percent reductions in capital wealth, in 2023, relative to a world without the climate change experienced since 1950. GDP per capita is a useful measure for estimating government tax receipts and a proxy for personal income levels. A recent estimate of GDP losses, combining three of these results and produced by the PI for a previous ECF-funded project on the cost of climate change in the UK, is shown below.
> 
> However, lower GDP levels also imply the long-term destruction of productive capital, and an estimate of those capital losses will provide new evidence on the true losses borne by these countries due to climate change. The losses would also be reported as a global average and for various regional and country groups (e.g., LLMICs, G77, Sub-Saharan Africa).
> 
> Annually varying loss estimates will underlie these results, which will reflect greater losses in years with heat waves and in later years as climate change accelerates. We will develop short case studies from the EU and LLMICs will compare these GDP losses to other reported impacts of recent heat waves.
> 
> The estimates will be produced as part of a short report made initially available to the sponsors Nov. 1, 2023, and for release during COP 28. The work will then be prepared for academic publication.
> 
> Unique contribution: To produce these results, we bring together existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate (see Table under Points of Methodology). Over the past decade, this literature has proposed many different approaches to understanding the effect of climate on GDP, including investigations of the differential vulnerability of poor countries, the role of persistent losses to growth, and the potential of adaptation. Current attempts to synthesise this literature are limited to simply averaging the results. Using a machine learning model, calibrated to the results from this literature, we will produce an estimate that reflects the most advanced features of all of these papers.
> 
> The PI has developed a system for generating projections from this class of models for the UK climate impacts project. The machine learning approach is based on another of the PIâ€™s projects, producing a best-estimate of the social cost of carbon.

> 
> We will use ERA5 reanalysis weather data to produce historical projections of climate effects, available 1940 - present. To construct the counterfactual without climate change, we will resample values from the baseline period (1940 - 1960). A key question in the literature is the extent to which impacts put countries on a permanently lower growth trajectory. This was carefully analysed in a previous paper of the PIâ€™s, and the resulting uncertain distribution of persistence will be used here.
> 
> Drawing upon both the headline estimates and additional results in the paper will provide evidence across the space of possible combinations of model elements. A random forest model will then be fit to these models, informed by meta-data about each. Finally, the random forest will be queried for damages from a model that simultaneously represents high-quality features in all model categories.
> 
> As an additional line of evidence, we will use the previously mentioned Howard & Sterner meta-analysis of damage results derived from expert elicitation. This provides both a measure of catastrophic risk, which will be applied uniformly across the globe, and an estimate of non-catastrophic global losses, which can be used as a loose constraint on the sum of the machine learning results.

> 
> I am now writing the results and findings section. The first part should discuss impacts in 2022. (Note that these impacts are not specific to 2022, but rather describe losses that have accumulated to the present day under climate change.) It should highlight key country results and discuss the map of losses across the globe. This is then further explained under economic group and regional results: Present the key findings related to economic groups and regions and discuss their implications.
> 
> Here are bullet points for the results to be discussed in this section:
> 
>  - Global population-weighted GDP loss in 2022 is 6.4% [IQR 2.4 - 8.5%], accounting for direct, international, and capital losses. As a percentage of global GDP, however, that is a loss of 0.6% [3.6% loss to 1.9% gain]. This is because of the significant benefits experienced by many richer countries.
>  - Losses are considerable across the Global South, with double-digit losses in many areas of the tropics and averaging 10% across Africa in 2022 (Fig. #FPMAP). Southern Africa shows the largest regional losses at 17% of GDP (Fig. #FPECO).
>  - In contrast, much of Europe and northern Asia shows benefits from climate change (5% for Europe and 7% for Central Asia, Fig. #FPREG), driven by reduced winter chill.
>  - The United States shows a benefit of 2% of GDP, while China shows no change (Fig. #FPMAP).
>  -  This exacerbates global inequality. Averaged across the developed world or OECD, there are almost no current aggregate losses from climate change [IQR 3% loss to 5% gain]. In contrast, low income countries show an average 11% loss of GDP [6 - 15%].
>  - In terms of total dollars (constant 2015 USD), GDP in high-income countries has increased an estimated $287 billion due to climate change, while the rest of the world has lost $1217 billion (see #LEVELCHANGE).
>  - The majority of these losses are direct impacts from local temperature. International impacts increase losses by approximately 1 pp for each country outside of Europe and North America. Capital effects increase losses by 1 - 2 pp in most regions.

> ### Results and Findings
> 
> The climatic changes experienced since the mid-20th century have resulted in evident and significant economic impacts across the globe. These impacts, both positive and negative, vary widely by region and are largely dependent on the underlying economic structure and climatic vulnerability of each country.
> 
> #### 2022 Global and Regional Impacts
> 
> Globally, the population-weighted GDP loss due to climate change in 2022 is substantial at 6.4%, taking into account the direct, international, and capital losses related to climate. Yet, the percentage of the global GDP loss is 0.6%, as wealthier nations have been able to leverage these changes more effectively. These figures vividly illustrate the dichotomy in the impacts of climate change across regions and economic zones, as demonstrated by the map of losses across the globe (See: Fig. #FPMAP).
> 
> In contrast with the global average, the Global South and particularly tropical regions, have borne the brunt of climate related losses. African nations have experienced an average loss of 10% in GDP in 2022. Most severely impacted is Southern Africa, which has suffered an average loss of 17% of GDP (Fig. #FPECO). These staggering numbers underscore the vulnerability of these regions to climate disruptions and their negative socio-economic effects.
> 
> Interestingly, some regions, particularly Europe and northern Asia, have actually seen economic benefits from climate change. Europe and Central Asia have registered increases of 5% and 7% in GDP respectively (Fig. #FPREG). These benefits arise from reduced winter chill, which lowers energy consumption and mortality rates, among other factors.
> 
> While the direct impacts from local temperature remain the dominant factor in most regions, there were also significant international effects and capital losses. In countries outside Europe and North America, international impacts amplified losses by about 1 pp. Capital effects further swelled losses by 1-2 pp in most regions.
> 
> #### Economic Group Results and Implications
> 
> Consistent with the overall regional results, the economic impacts of climate change present a stark contrast between developed and developing nations. For the developed world or OECD countries, negligible aggregate losses from climate change have been recorded, with a small chance of even slight gains [IQR 3% loss to 5% gain]. 
> 
> Meanwhile, low-income countries have been heavily impacted, averaging an 11% loss of GDP [6 - 15%]. This exacerbates the already glaring global inequality and underscores the disproportionate burden of climate change on these nations. 
> 
> The United States and China, as the world's two largest economies, illustrate this divide. While the US saw a 2% gain in GDP in 2022, China experienced no change, despite its rapid economic growth in recent years. 
> 
> The cost to high-income countries has been minimal, in fact they have seen a net gain of approximately $287 billion (constant 2015 USD). Meanwhile, the rest of the world has experienced an estimated net GDP loss of $1217 billion (see #LEVELCHANGE). 
> 
> These findings not only highlight the current economic disparities caused by climate change, but also provide insights into the potential future trajectories if these trends continue unchecked.
**user**:
> Please now add a section on Voting blocs at the UNFCCC COP meetings: Discuss how results impact or relate to these blocs. Include the following information:
> 
>  - Figure #FPGRP shows these results by UNFCCC party groupings. Most coalitions represent average losses in 2022 of around 10% of the GDP of the member countries. For example, the G-77 has an average loss of 6% of GDP [1 - 10%]. The Small Island Developing States (SIDS) under AOSIS have a loss of 9% [4 - 11%], and this is likely a significant underestimate since sea-level rise is not accounted for. The EU, on the other hand, has average gains of 2% [2% loss to 5% gain].

> ### Impact on Voting Blocs at UNFCCC COP Meetings
> 
> The results of the estimated economic impacts of climate change have important implications for the various voting blocs and party groupings at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings. These impacts shed light on the diverse interests, positions, and motivations of these blocs in their pursuit of climate action.
> 
> #### UNFCCC Party Groupings and Economic Impacts
> 
> Figure #FPGRP provides a visualization of these results by UNFCCC party groupings, offering insights into the economic losses or gains experienced by member countries within each group.
> 
> Many coalition groups, such as the G-77, which represents a large number of developing countries, have experienced average losses in 2022 of around 10% of their GDP, with a range of 1% to 10% (Fig. #FPGRP). This signifies the substantial economic burdens faced by these countries due to climate change impacts. Notably, the average loss for the G-77 is 6% of GDP, with a range of 1% to 10%. The Small Island Developing States (SIDS) under the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) have experienced an average loss of 9%, with a range of 4% to 11%. However, it is worth noting that these estimates likely underestimate the actual losses for SIDS, as they do not fully account for the impacts of sea-level rise, a significant concern for these vulnerable nations.
> 
> In contrast to the economic losses experienced by many developing countries, the European Union (EU) demonstrates average gains in GDP of 2%, with a range of a 2% loss to a 5% gain. The EU's positive economic impacts reflect the benefits it has derived from climate change, particularly in regions such as Europe and Central Asia, where reduced winter chill has led to improved economic outcomes (Fig. #FPREG).
> 
> #### Implications for Voting Positions and Negotiations
> 
> The divergent economic impacts observed among the UNFCCC party groupings significantly influence their positions and priorities in the negotiations at COP meetings. Countries facing substantial economic losses, such as those in the G-77 and SIDS, are likely to advocate for strong mitigation measures and demand support from developed countries in addressing climate-related damages. These findings provide these blocs with critical evidence to emphasize the urgency and necessity of international cooperation and financial assistance.
