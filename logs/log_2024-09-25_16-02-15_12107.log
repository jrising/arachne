> On my QNAP NAS, I have an error that my storage pool space is critically low, and I need to free 32 GB of space. But the volume I have on that storage pool has lots of free space. What do I do?
**assistant**:
> When you encounter an error on your QNAP NAS indicating that the storage pool space is critically low, but your volume appears to have plenty of free space, it usually means that the storage pool itself is running out of free blocks, which might not directly reflect in the reported volume free space. Here’s what you can do to address the issue:
> 
> 1. **Check Snapshot Usage**: 
>    - Snapshots can consume a significant amount of space in your storage pool. Check your snapshot manager and see if you can delete old or unnecessary snapshots to free up space.
> 
> 2. **Reclaim Unused Space**:
>    - Go to the "Storage & Snapshots" app, select your storage pool, and look for an option to reclaim or free space. This process can help recover space that might be marked as used due to old or deleted files.
> 
> 3. **Expand the Storage Pool**:
>    - If possible, consider expanding your storage pool. You can do this by adding additional drives if available, or by swapping out existing drives for larger ones and rebuilding the RAID.
> 
> 4. **Check for System Reserved Space**:
>    - Sometimes, space is reserved for system use (e.g., QTS files and system logs). Check if there’s any unnecessary system-reserved space that can be cleared.
> 
> 5. **Manage Shared Folders and Quotas**:
>    - Ensure that shared folder quota settings are properly configured, as misconfigured quotas might prevent free space from being reported correctly.
> 
> 6. **Remove Unnecessary Applications**:
>    - If there are applications running on your NAS that you no longer need, consider uninstalling them to free up space.
> 
> 7. **Update Firmware**:
>    - Make sure your NAS’s firmware is up to date, as updates might fix bugs or provide optimizations that can resolve the issue.
> 
> If you've tried these steps and still experience problems, you may want to consult QNAP support or refer to their forums for specific advice related to your NAS model and configuration.
