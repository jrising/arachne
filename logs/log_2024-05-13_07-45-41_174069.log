> what is impact investing v. charity ?
**assistant**:
> Impact investing and charity are both ways of deploying resources for social or environmental good, but they differ in their approach and objectives:
> 
> 1. **Impact Investing**:
>    - **Objective**: Impact investing aims to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. Investors seek to drive positive change while also expecting a financial return on their investment.
>    - **Method**: Impact investors typically invest in businesses, organizations, or funds that align with their values and goals. They consider both the impact and financial performance of their investments.
>    - **Examples**: Investing in companies that promote sustainable practices, renewable energy projects, affordable housing initiatives, or social enterprises that address pressing social issues.
> 
> 2. **Charity**:
>    - **Objective**: Charity focuses on providing financial or in-kind support to address social or environmental issues without the expectation of financial return. The primary goal is to make a positive impact on society or the environment.
>    - **Method**: Charitable organizations raise funds through donations and grants, which are then used to support programs, initiatives, or services that benefit the community or address specific needs.
>    - **Examples**: Donating to food banks, supporting educational programs for underserved youth, funding medical research, or providing disaster relief efforts.
> 
> While impact investing and charity both aim to create positive change, impact investing leverages financial resources to drive social and environmental impact while also aiming for a financial return, whereas charity involves giving resources without the expectation of financial gain. Both approaches play important roles in addressing societal challenges and advancing towards a more sustainable and equitable future.
