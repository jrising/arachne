> 1. Introduction
> To build a modern electric power grid, we must solve problems including reducing
> CO2 emissions and criteria pollutants, adapting the grid to support variable generation,
> and increasing reliability. Many of the solutions to these problems involve distributed
> storage. The focus of this article is on distributed storage using electric vehicles because
> EVs inherently have large batteries that are connected to the grid, and privately owned
> light vehicles are only used for transportation 4% of the time [1]. Their duty cycle for
> driving would mean that lithium-ion batteries, in today’s new EVs with capacity in the
> range of 70 kWh, could be available for distributed storage as much as the remaining
> 96% of the time. Thus, EVs promise a large, underutilized, distributed electric storage
> resource, potentially of value to utilities or to regional transmission operators (RTOs). The
> Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would designate EVs used for grid storage
> as “distributed energy resources”, or DERs. RTOs use grid services markets, including
> services provided by EVs or other DERs, and are subject to regulation by FERC.
> This article summarizes our work to understand how the RTO rule changes mandated
> by FERC Order 2222 [2] could facilitate interconnecting EVs as compliant DERs, and how to
> qualify for high-value RTO electricity markets. Such interconnection is needed to realize the

> discharging to the grid. We choose to analyze the RTO “ancillary service” (A/S) markets,
> as they draw power in brief intervals, thus minimally affecting the battery state of charge.
> We consider how to qualify for diverse markets to interconnect under current rules and

> business opportunities for private enterprise.
> 1.1. EV Capabilities Required for V2G, and for EVs as a DER
> A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system consists of an electric vehicle with an EV charger
> enabled to both charge and discharge to the grid, and with communications able to control
> that power flow at times useful to the grid. Bidirectional power flow is emphasized because
> it has over 12 times the value of simply controlling the speed and timing of charging
> alone [5]. We examine AC charging because it is much lower cost and more reliably
> maintains the connection over time in comparison to DC charging.
> In order to base revenue calculations on realistic values, this article draws quantitative
> estimates from an actual EV outfitted with a bidirectional charger, with four-quadrant
> control, connected to a distributed energy resource aggregator (DERA) control system. A
> DERA control system, also defined by FERC, dispatches a group of EVs (or other DERs)
> to charge or discharge to satisfy market participation requirements and minimize battery
> wear, while ensuring sufficient charge for trips. The V2G charging station is outfitted with
> communications to send dispatch commands to DER V2G vehicles and return performance
> data from the EV to the DERA.
> The DERA, defined In FERC and RTO regulatory language, Is what has also been
> called a virtual power plant. The U.S. Department of Energy defines virtual power plants
> as the following: “Virtual power plants, generally considered a connected aggregation of
> distributed energy resource (DER) technologies, offer deeper integration of renewables
> and demand flexibility, which in turn offers more Americans cleaner and more affordable
> power [6]”. DERs can be devices that provide energy storage, energy generation, or demand
> reduction in response to a signal.
> Since many RTO grid services are paid according to the power response to a signal,
> higher revenue can be achieved if the charging electronics are capable of rapid response to
> commands to charge or discharge, and if more power is discharged per EV. By contrast,
> local electric markets are more often based on energy pricing, often varying by time of day,
> with no penalty to respond more slowly. Energy markets can be controlled by a signal
> from a DERA but also can function based on a simple detection of local time. DERA-based
> systems would also require DERs to respond with meter readings demonstrating response
> accuracy and speed, with all the DER responses aggregated by the DERA. For local retail
> power markets based on time-of-day energy price changes, the building meter from the
> local EDC may be sufficient to register the value of changes in consumption or of production
> and consumption.
> Since the primary use of the EV is for transportation, an aggregator or DERA must al-
> ways subordinate grid requests to required EV charging for an upcoming trip—in operation,

> our University of Delaware EV research and development group (hence, UD EV Group) has
> found that these rarely conflict. In other words, an EV owner, or a DER application, could
> examine the typical and worst-case energy consumption for daily vehicle use, consider
> unplanned trips, and calculate the amount of kWh required to be stored to travel the next
> day. This customer- and travel-specific stored energy requirement can be both a buffer to
> meet customer needs and a parameter to calculate EV power availability for a DERA.
> A fleet of EVs with V2G, controlled by a DERA, can respond to requests for grid
> support as a group, while any individual EV can prioritize that driver’s individual needs.
> For tracking each vehicle’s needs and for differentially dispatching individual EVs, the EV
> must provide a unique identifier. For example, in the EV charging station communication
> standards J3068 [7] and IEC15118, this is provided by a digital signal over the charging
> cable when plugged in to a charging station. For V2G, the car’s ID can be used to determine
> which EVs to dispatch and the account to credit. For simple charging, the ID can identify
> the account to bill for charging, or the ID can even authorize whether an individual EV is
> allowed to charge in specific lots or at individual charging stations.
> If policies are well constructed, EVs with V2G power and signaling could benefit
> many parties. Energy consumers gain the ability to charge their EVs at lower electric rates
> by timing charging to non-peak hours at the electric distribution company (EDC) level,
> as controlled load or time-of-day balancing at the EDC level, or as an ancillary service
> provider at the regional transmission operator (RTO) level. Grid operators (RTOs or EDCs)
> also gain the benefits of having more power management resources available, provided
> from a directly controlled battery power system they do not need to finance, construct,
> or maintain. In essence, by utilizing DERAs, the power system can enable aggregators
> to create virtual energy storage systems that act as any large conventional energy system
> would, yet without as much investment, construction, and maintenance as a conventional
> storage facility would require. The only thing that grid operators need to do is compensate
> EV owners for services provided at current rates. To illustrate the potential availability
> of new storage, a recent study estimated that global use of V2G technology could yield
> 18–30 TWh of storage by 2050 [8]. Xu et al. compared four scenarios of future grid
> 4-h storage need, with self-described “conservative” assumptions, found that in all years
> analyzed, 2030, 2040, and 2050, V2G in EVs was sufficient to meet the storage needs of the
> grid without added storage built only for grid purposes [8]. Short-term energy storage
> is defined as follows: “Short-term energy storage demand is typically defined as a 4-h
> storage system, referring to the ability of a storage system to operate at a capacity where
> the maximum power delivered from that storage over time can be maintained for 4 h”. In
> this article, we analyze short term storage because it “accounts for a majority of required
> storage capacity. . .” [8].
> 1.2. The Monetary Value of Energy Storage Used for Wholesale Grid Services
> Grid service markets can be divided into those managed by RTOs in FERC-regulated
> wholesale markets, and those managed by EDCs in state-regulated retail markets. V2G can
> qualify to provide ancillary services and capacity as RTO services, but since EV storage
> does not create new energy, V2G cannot participate in energy markets. Ancillary services
> ensure the system remains stable and that power is continuously delivered [9]. Important
> ancillary services include regulation, spinning reserves, non-spinning reserves, black start,
> and load response [9]. Capacity is another RTO grid service generally not defined as an
> ancillary service, but it similarly provides injected power generation or demand reduction
> upon a signal from the RTO and could be provided by EVs.
> We examine one RTO, PJM, to analyze specific rules and prices. In PJM, regulation
> has the function of keeping a stable grid frequency and balancing inter-regional power
> transfers. The regulation ancillary service market exists to perform this task [9]. Regulation
> consists of both upregulation and downregulation, abbreviated as RegUp and RegDown.
> When there is excess power on the grid, the RTO requests RegDown, signaling battery
> systems to charge or generators to ramp down. When there is not enough power on the
> Energies 2024, 17, 2664 4 of 18
> grid, the RTO would request RegUp, signaling battery systems to discharge or generators
> to increase production.
> Batteries are especially good at providing regulation because they can simply charge
> or discharge when they receive a signal. Response times for batteries to perform grid
> services are on the scale of seconds or 100′s of milliseconds rather than minutes as required
> for conventional generators; thus, batteries can more easily meet RTO reliability standards.
> Thermal power plants need time to ramp up or ramp down production. While those
> thermal generators can provide regulation services, due to their slow response, only 10% of
> those power facilities participate in any way in the regulation market [10]. To fill in the gap
> created by the inability of baseload generators to respond quickly to load events, they are
> commonly supplemented by inefficient and expensive peaking generators [10].
> 1.3. Retail Markets, On-Peak and Off-Peak Value of Energy
> The other major type of market for V2G is the retail energy market. Retail markets are
> based on tariffs between EDCs (electric distribution companies, commonly called utilities),
> and monitored through a building or premises meter. EDCs buy electricity from generators
> on the RTO wholesale market and use it to supply the electricity needs of customers through
> time; the cost to acquire energy is passed on to customers via their electric bill.
> At the end of 2017, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) determined that,
> of the 1187 GWs of capacity resources on the U.S. grid, 261 GWs were fossil fuel peaking
> capacity resources [11] (p. 2). Peak generators usually only operate for short periods of
> time. It is not uncommon to have a peak generator only activated and used a few times a
> year for intervals lasting an hour. They are used when peak load or generator failures occur.
> Every day, the grid has peaks and valleys centered around moments of time-determined
> activity among energy consumers. A typical daily load curve usually peaks in the afternoon
> between 5 and 7 p.m. when people are preparing dinner, using cooling or heating, and
> turning on lights [12]. Demand usually drops off after 8 p.m. and continues to fall until
> between 2 and 4 a.m. where the cycle then repeats. These use times are separated into
> on-peak and off-peak hours. On-peak hours generally occur on weekdays between 7 a.m.
> and 11 p.m. while off-peak hours occur from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays, all day on
> weekends, and on holidays [12]. These timeframes are not universal and can vary by EDC
> jurisdiction. In an analysis performed by the EIA in 2011, it was estimated that the power
> usage in the entire New England region fluctuates by as much as 5 GW of load throughout
> an average day in autumn [13].
> Peak generators only generate energy during peak hours, and thus there is less time to
> recoup the capital cost, so the price must be higher for each kWh produced. Conversely, at
> the lowest demand hours of the day, only the lowest-cost generators need be used, making
> the cost per kWh the lowest of the day. Batteries provide an opportunity to charge during
> times of low cost and discharge during times of high cost. This operating mode is referred
> to as “energy arbitrage”. If the storage is located on the load side of a retail meter, and the
> metered premises is already on a time-of-use rate, arbitrage can be performed and reduce
> the energy bill by controlling charge and discharge by the rate at each time of day, without
> any direct signal. Further, the financial benefit to the owner of the storage is embedded
> in the time-of-use rate—there is no separate payment. If the discharge from storage is
> greater than load at times, power will flow from the premises and be “injected” into the
> grid, which requires interconnection for injection. Injection is also called backfeeding. Full
> credit of injected electric energy requires “net energy metering” (NEM) where the value of
> each kWh injected is credited against the value of an earlier kWh purchased. (This article
> will use NEM loosely to refer both to net kWh and net value, the latter considering that
> retail EDC value per kWh may differ at different times.) Since the only two approvals
> required for energy arbitrage are also needed for solar power behind a premises meter
> (injection and NEM), the regulatory and approval mechanisms for arbitrage are established
> in most jurisdictions, although they may require wording changes or utility commission
> approval. EV energy storage systems can have an efficiency of 85–95% for AC–DC–AC
> Energies 2024, 17, 2664 5 of 18
> conversions [14], can have up to 8 h of potential discharge time at 6–10 kW, and can last
> around 5000 full charge discharge cycles before needing to be replaced [15].
> Batteries do not generate power; they require charging before discharge and thus are
> always net loads due to efficiency loss; in EVs, they are net loads also due to energy used
> for driving. For controls, battery storage systems simply need to purchase energy during
> times when demands are lowest, then either stop charging or discharge when demand is
> highest. That is, for the peak and off-peak markets, the battery system (V2G or otherwise)
> can simply charge or discharge based on the local price at a given moment. It need not
> be controlled remotely, and if net metered by the EDC, the payment or compensation is
> automatically achieved via EDC billing.
> 1.4. FERC Order 2222 Seeks to Require RTOs to Allow DERAs in TSO Markets
> As of this writing (spring 2024) the U.S. regional transmission operators (RTOs) lack rules
> that give customer-located DERs interconnection and deny access to most energy markets.
> Inertia by RTOs and perhaps other factors have caused DERs to be underutilized for efficient
> energy production. Given the potential of DERs being able to evelized energy production of
> renewables, the discouragement of them in the wider market both reduces the United States’
> energy security and the ability of the country to provide non-CO2 electricity resources.
> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is the department of the federal
> government responsible for oversight of wholesale transfer of energy across the United
> States. Their duties include regulation of the transmission of natural gas, oil, and electricity
> during interstate commerce, ensuring the reliability of the interstate high-voltage system,
> and managing and investigating energy markets [16]. In essence, FERC is the ultimate
> adjudicator of the rules and guidelines for all RTOs, except the Electric Reliability Council
> of Texas (ERCOT), because of their federally appointed ability to oversee interstate energy
> sales and markets. Each RTO except ERCOT falls under this jurisdiction because each
> manages markets which produce energy that can be transported and consumed beyond
> the borders of a single state.
> Recognizing the future potential of DER resources, FERC proposed and issued Order
> 2222 in September of 2020. Order 2222 has the explicit goal of opening the wider electrical
> grid and energy markets to the use of DERs. According to FERC’s statements, the order
> is intended to “usher in the electric grid of the future and promote competition in electric
> markets by removing the barriers preventing distributed energy resources (DERs) from
> competing on a level playing field in the organized capacity, energy and ancillary services
> markets run by regional grid operators” [17]. Under FERC definitions, DERs are individual
> devices with a nameplate capacity of 1–10,000 kW, can be located on an EDC distribution
> system, or behind a customer meter, and include any combination of electric storage, inter-
> mittent generation, distributed generation, demand response, energy efficiency, thermal
> storage, or electric vehicles and their charging equipment [17]. The goal of the order is
> to allow for non-traditional distributed energy management to operate simultaneously
> and compete with conventional on-demand generation methods. This opening of the
> wholesale market should decrease consumer costs due to competition. In addition, it will
> likely increase grid reliability, allow for increasing the number of platforms for energy
> technology innovation, and increase national security by reducing the impact of power line
> failure. Order 2222 also allows, and defines, DER aggregations. As previously explained,
> aggregations allow for individual DERs to combine to form a distributed energy resource
> aggregation (DERA). From the perspective of an administrator, the aggregation is a single
> generator regardless of how many components it comprises. There is no upper limit for the
> number of individual DERs that meet FERC standards to be combined into a DERA [2]. Order
> 2222 is intended to enable the use of batteries for DER and the potential cost-effectiveness of
> batteries shared with other purposes, such as EVs with V2G behind the meter.
> Some prior work has examined the value of storage devices for grid services. For
> example, an NREL 2013 study compared spinning reserves, capacity, energy arbitrage,
> and regulation, finding that regulation was the most lucrative market 90% of the time [18].
> Energies 2024, 17, 2664 6 of 18
> The NREL study incorporated the market value of displacing conventional generation, as

> 1.5. Experience with Interconnection as Demand Response, Small Generator, or “DR
> with Injection”
> Our UD EV Group has earned revenue in the A/S regulation market when registered
> as a demand response resource (DR) qualified for the regulation market. However, we
> were able to do so only via an odd precedent that allows injecting power only if a Muni
> substation meter is used as the meter for registration with PJM, rather than the retail
> premises meter. Originally, DR-interconnected resources provided grid services by turning
> off equipment during times of insufficient electricity—thus, for traditional DR, there was
> no interconnection concern with injection, and no need for net metering. Disadvantages
> of interconnection as DR include that the RTO prohibits injection from DR (except in
> Munis, as noted) and does not allow participating in other A/S markets besides regulation.
> (Technically, for DR we are in the “Regulation only” market, the “only” meaning that PJM
> provides no compensation for energy, only for power response.)
> We were advised by PJM to interconnect as Small Generator (SG) to be permitted
> to inject power through the retail meter while providing grid services, and in addition
> to be able to participate in the reserves market and possibly others. PJM created SG
> registration for energy resources primarily producing energy, and typically connected
> to local distribution lines rather than behind a retail meter. Although this was a logical
> method to interconnect our V2G EVs, after a multi-year process requiring going through the
> registration queue designed for large generators, the legal department insisted that a storage
> device behind a retail meter was prohibited from registering as a small generator. Despite
> repeated requests, they could not provide any written rule or tariff that prohibited our
> approach. The University of Delaware retained two wholesale power-qualified attorneys
> who communicated with PJM legal, with the conclusion that although we might win a
> legal case, the additional time and cost was not justified given that another interconnection
> pathway was likely to be provided by PJM’s planned compliance with FERC Order 2222.
> A different problem with SG registration was that many PJM departments were
> concerned about “double counting”—that PJM would pay for energy in the wholesale
> market, while via net metering, the local utility would also pay us for the same energy. We
> argued that with “regulation only”, we are paying the utility for net load in kWh, with no
> energy payment from PJM. That is, the utility meters and we are credited for injected kWh,
> and for the RTO, we meter and are credited for a response in kW. This transaction is not
> double counting because two different commodities are being transacted (accumulated
> kWh versus being ready to provide an exact number of kW at any time).
> A third problem discovered with SG registration is related to our operation In a Muni;
> PJM was concerned with the Muni buying power from a transmission operator. When we
> reviewed the planned SG operation with the transmission operator staff, they claimed that
> each injection by an SG-registered resource within the Muni must be metered in kWh and
> time of day and reported to the transmission operator for them to carry out “reconciliation”
> with the Muni. We objected that no energy was being produced and that there would be
> no financial impact to the EDC if we purchased a kWh of electricity and then injected the
> same kWh later—and, that the cost of added metering and constant recordkeeping for
> each small injection would have been prohibitive. We also pointed out that we had been
> transacting exactly the same number of kWh back and forth between our DER and the
> Muni for several years in the regulation market under DR registration, and no one had ever
> raised the question of reconciliation; we just paid the appropriate net kWhs as metered
> to the Muni. For the new SG registration, we even offered to forgo EDC net metering
> and to bid A/S to PJM with a zero-energy price. That is, essentially, we would buy the
> kWh commodity, yet when discharging we would give the same kWhs away for free to
> the local EDC (which would be a commercial loser but of value as a demonstration of
> Energies 2024, 17, 2664 7 of 18
> SG—see our later calculation to quantify the financial impact of operating without net
> metering). None of our offers were accepted, neither to the transmission operator nor to
> PJM legal. Finally, PJM legal cancelled our SG registration and pulled us from the queue,
> under written objection by UD council. This faulty process is documented in the comments
> of 6 Nov 2023, by the University of Delaware EV Group to FERC, on Docket ER22-962-005
> in response to PJM’s second compliance filing regarding FERC Order 2222 [19].
> Based on analysis of these barriers by PJM staff and PJM’s DER stakeholder group,
> PJM has suggested a new interconnection model, Demand Response with Distribution
> Injection (DrwDI), to comply with FERC Order 2222. PJM defines this model as follows:
> “The same as DR but also has Generation that is approved by the EDC to inject onto the

> On and off-peak pricing is an example of an EDC billing program that can be paid
> to customers for shifting appliance use in time. Examples include washing machines,
> dishwashers, charging of EVs, and any other electric device with flexibility of time of use.
> Customers can save by shifting usage of appliances, moving to off-peak at a lower price.
> Utilities may vary the price schedule by season, but within one season, time-of-day pricing
> is consistent at each time range.
> To calculate savings from the EDC peak power rates, we used as a tariff example
> Delmarva Power’s (DPL) peak pricing rates. On-peak is defined as 12–8 p.m., Monday–
> Friday, in summer and winter, with summer defined as June through September, and winter
> is October through May; all other times including weekday holidays are off-peak. [22].
> This analysis specifically uses Delmarva Power’s plug-in-vehicle charging rate (PIV) for
> on- and off-peak prices instead of its standard time-of-use (TOU) rate for peak prices. The
> calculation of revenue yields larger savings than most time-of-day rates due to high pricing
> extremes for the PIV tariff. EDCs can have different peak rates and times among peak
> pricing programs and can differ among customer classes within a single EDC. The DPL
> primary electric tariff lists the rates for the EV peak charging program. Summer pricing for
> on-peak is USD 0.1473/kWh, summer off-peak is USD 0.07242/kWh (SOP), winter on-peak
> is USD 0.1720, and winter off-peak is USD 0.08356 (WOP).
> The Ford Mach-Es have an energy expenditure per workday of 9.903 kWh based on
> operator-estimated driving usage. We would expect an average yearly energy consumption
> (AYC) of 2584.683 kWh assuming a work year of 261 days. The total money saved is the
> difference between charging an EV at standard retail rates and off-peak. Delmarva Power’s
> energy commercial retail rate (ECRR) in 2021 was USD 0.1136/kWh [23].
> Equation (1) calculates total yearly energy cost (TEC) and assumes that the EVs begin

> 2.3. Arbitrage with Injection
> “Injection” is when an electric generator behind a premise meter generates electricity
> that flows onto the distribution utility’s grid infrastructure, the reverse direction that power
> traditionally flows through power lines at the retail level. This differs from large-scale
> conventional generators because the power flow comes from a device behind the retail
> meter. Injected energy is a financial loss to the consumer unless net energy metering (NEM)
> is enabled. NEM was established for premises with solar that produce and sometimes inject.
> Unlike solar, a scenario that uses V2G or other storage behind the meter has no generation.
> Similar to the example of bill savings outlined previously, arbitrage with injection
> utilizes differential rates for on-peak and off-peak charging. V2G EVs can make money by
> purchasing energy when prices are low then discharging during times of on-peak prices
> and when not driving. V2G arbitrage buys low and sells high to earn revenue from the
> flow of power, and because on- and off-peak rates are established by EDCs and locked
> in for a period of time, there is no guesswork as to whether the price will be stable. This
> process is known as energy arbitrage.

> The Select Mach-E consumption rate is 329 Wh/mile and based on expected usage will

> At a charging rate of 19.2 kW, it takes 0.516 h to recharge a 75.7 kWh Mach-E battery
> after a day of use (9.903 kWh/19.2 kW = 0.516 h to recharge).

> (168 h−42.58 h = 125.42 h available). This calculation uses the same regulation price and
> retail energy price from the previous calculation. Losses are estimated at 5% (1–0.95) of the
> 20% capacity throughput. (19.2 kW ×0.2 ×0.05 = 0.192 kW in losses). From Equation (7),

> among regulation up (discharging), regulation down (charging), and idle. The use of a
> control signal, also called automatic generation control (AGC), is used by RTOs for A/S
> markets, including regulation and reserves, as well as capacity. Because responding to
> the signal when requested is essential, renumeration based on the power capability (kW)
> offered may be substantially larger than renumeration on the energy that flows (kWh).
> These markets are compared down the rows in Table 2. This table gives the basic
> requirements for each service, including whether net metering is required, whether inter-
> connection permission is required, how requests are signaled, regulatory requirements,
> and in the “revenue or savings” columns, the annual revenue for both a 10 kW and a 50 kW
> V2G charging system. Based on our upper estimate of serial production cost of a 10 kW
> charging with bidirectional power flow and J3068 signaling (USD 525), the simple payback

> Table 2 summarizes the revenue or bill savings calculated in this paper for each service,

> because for the case study parameters, arbitrage was limited by battery capacity more than
> power. In this study, like a number of others, the RTO services typically earn much more

> attractive. The return for higher power in the regulation market would probably justify a
> higher power charging/discharging system on the vehicle (payback not shown in table for
> 50 kW). In Table 3, we compare the same markets as Table 2, now varying efficiency, power

> Table 3 uses the formulae developed to analyze each market—regulation, off-peak

> arbitrage revenue is reduced at lower power (despite the same battery capacity in each
> scenario) because at lower power, the EV becomes incapable of full discharge within the
> peak time specified in the case study rate. For example, the revenue for energy arbitrage
> operating at a discharge rate of 40 kW would be the same as 50 kW because both rates
> discharge 43 kWhs (final available battery capacity used in this study) in under 3 h—the
> time that the EV is available during peak rates. The three rows show differing efficiencies
> of the power converter (using efficiencies of [3]), and the effect of conversion losses on each
> market. We show no revenue change from controlled charging as a service because there
> are no added cycles due to the service.
> Negative values appear under energy arbitrage lacking NEM because energy is billed
> when consumed, but not credited when the same energy is later returned to the grid. (The
> EDC treats storing energy as load rather than as providing a service.) This results in a
> storage system that loses money for the operator if there is no NEM credit. Regulation is
> a payment for being available to provide power flow on command by the grid. The two
> biggest factors affecting regulation revenue are high power and net energy metering.
> One could project, in the future, that there would be so many EVs they would undersell
> and drive higher-price storage and power plants out of these markets. Given the very
> large resource of the coming EV fleet, the values shown here would eventually saturate
> EDC-level programs like today’s simple time-of-day rate structure [1,8]. In one sense, this
> is a desirable state, not a problem, because storage would by then command lower prices
> and the grid would be more stable and more reliable at lower cost. In the intermediate term,
> we may expect retail utilities to modify rate structures to a new future of abundant storage,
> and for RTOs to adjust market rules for additional purposes of storage (e.g., capacity in
> addition to A/S). If these policy changes are made, ultimately, lower market prices for
> storage will lead to an equilibrium in which marginal additional resources may choose not
> to participate in grid service markets; this is not a problem, it is an indicator of a solution.
> 5. Conclusions
> As EVs increasingly enter the vehicle fleet, analyses have shown that V2G will be
> a large resource, capable of addressing major systemic problems related to the energy
> transition [1,8]. Retail bill savings from EVs can be gained with today’s rules, but greater
> Energies 2024, 17, 2664 17 of 18
> savings result from implementation of appropriate policies (wholesale market access,
> interconnection for behind-the-meter injection, and NEM). If RTO policy and tariffs were
> to allow consumers with capable EVs to participate in the A/S market, and if state policy
> made behind-the-meter storage qualify for NEM, consumers would be incentivized to
> buy EVs with such features and participate in markets. Note that revenue comes from
> EVs providing market services; the revenues shown here could be a substantial monetary
> incentive, yet they require no government subsidy. Such revenue to EV owners would help
> repay the initial cost of an EV over time.
> However, current RTO rules, as we document for one RTO based on our full inter-
> connection application process, now block any behind-the-meter storage (including V2G)
> from wholesale markets for ancillary services and capacity. Current rules in some RTOs
> also oddly disallow injection, even for DERS that are fully certified for injection [19]. Pro-
> hibiting the low-cost V2G resource slows renewable generation by virtue of lack of storage,
> wastes the EV storage as a resource, and increases costs for all EDC customers by requiring
> duplicate investment in storage (one set of batteries for EV, a second set of approximately
> as many batteries [8] purpose-built only for grid support). In the next two to five years, we
> hope to see that the US RTOs comply with FERC Order 2222 and open up this market. If
> RTOs do so, the wholesale markets we analyze will open significant value to EV owners,
> and a large, low-cost storage resource will become available to the grid.
