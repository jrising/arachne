**user**:
> Is there a way to ask ggplot to go through the motions of drawing a geom (a geom_tile for me), including adding it to the legend, but not actually have it draw that geom on the plot?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there is a way to ask ggplot to add a geom to the legend without actually drawing it on the plot. This can be achieved by using a combination of `geom_blank()` and `guide_legend()`. 
> 
> Here's an example code snippet:
> 
> ```R
> library(ggplot2)
> 
> # Create a blank ggplot object
> p <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = 1, y = 1, group = "Group 1"))
> 
> # Add a blank geom_tile but set the fill color to represent the desired legend entry
> p <- p + geom_blank(aes(fill = "Legend Entry"))
> 
> # Customize the legend
> p <- p + guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(color = NA)))
> 
> # Add other geoms, scales, and labels to the plot as needed
> # ...
> 
> # Display the plot
> print(p)
> ```
> 
> In this example, we create a blank ggplot object with a single data point and a grouping variable (`group`) set to "Group 1". We then add a blank `geom_tile()` to the plot, but map the `fill` aesthetic to a fixed value "Legend Entry" instead of using a variable from the dataset. This ensures that the legend is generated with a corresponding entry.
> 
> To hide the actual representation of the geom_tile on the plot, we use `geom_blank()` instead. Finally, we customize the legend appearance using `guides()` and `guide_legend()`. In this case, we set the `color` of the legend key to `NA` to make it invisible.
