>  - Masters in Marine Policy: Explain that this program has now
>    transitioned to the exciting new Environmental Science & Management
>    program
>    (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)
>    which has a Marine track.
>  - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
>    or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
>    prospective students.

>    to Xinfeng Liang <xfliang@udel.edu>.

> Now, in the form, I have gotten to a point where I need to let prospective students down gently but firmly, because they are interested in a taking a program but they do not have the funds to pay for it. Neither do any faculty and university funds are currently not available. Can you write up this text?
