> Chapter 6 Economic impacts of climate change Thread  Our best estimate is that global warming of 2.5 would make the average person feel as if she had lost 1.7% of her income. #climateeconomics  There are 62 estimates of the total economic impact of climate change, showing a wide range of results. Our confidence is thus low. #climateeconomics  Climate change may be beneficial at first but these are sunk gains. Future warming has net negative impacts. #climateeconomics  The uncertainty about the economic impact of climate change is large and negative sur- prises are more likely than positive surprises. #climateeconomics  Weather shocks have a larger impact than climate change because weather allows only for immediate adaptation. #climateeconomics  Poor countries are more vulnerable because a larger share of their economic activity is exposed to the weather. #climateeconomics  Poor countries are more vulnerable to climate change because they tend to be hotter and closer to biophysical limits. #climateeconomics  Poor countries are more vulnerable because they lack the means, the wherewithal, and the political will to adapt. #climateeconomics  As poverty implies vulnerability, economic growth is an often superior way to reduce the impact of climate change. #climateeconomics  International involvement in adaptation is obsolete except for the bureaucrats and con- sultants involved. #climateeconomics  International adaptation policy by and large ignores the lessons of decades of development policy. #climateeconomics 
>  The social cost of carbon is the benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a single tonne. #climateeconomics  The social cost of carbon is an estimate of the desirable intensity of climate policy. #cli- mateeconomics  The social cost of carbon depends on many things, so there are many, widely different estimates. #climateeconomics  The social cost of carbon is higher if the discount rate is lower, and its right tail is much fatter. #climateeconomics  The social cost of carbon should rise by some 2% per year. #climateeconomics 6.1 Reasons for concern** The impacts of climate change are many and diverse. The question whether climate change is beneficial or detrimental, big or large, depends on sector, location and time. Reading through Section 5.1, let alone the wider literature on which it is based, leaves you confused: Should you welcome climate change, be somewhat concerned, or worry a lot? Aggregate indicators are needed to assess whether climate change is, on balance, a good thing or a bad thing, and whether it is small or large relative to the many other problems that we have. Figure 6.1 uses alternative high-level indicators and displays them against projected climate change. The indicators are alternatives in that they would appeal to people with different attitudes, with different values. Some people worry about the unique and the vulnerable, such as atoll islands or butterflies. If you are so inclined, climate change is a big concern. Local extinctions of butterflies and global extinctions of rodents have been documented with climate change as the likely cause. Many butterflies have difficulty crossing open spaces and thus cannot migrate if climate changes. Some rodents live on islands and cannot move. If the limited climate change of the past century already caused such problems, the more rapid climate change projected for this century must be disastrous (from this perspective). Stringent climate policy is thus justified. Other people only care about large, systemic impacts of climate change, such as changes in ocean currents and the melting of the polar ice caps. If you are so inclined, then climate policy can wait. The probability of these scenarios is minute, at least in the 21st century, and in some cases it is not known how greenhouse gas emission reduction would affect those probabilities—indeed whether they would go up or down. Yet other people may care about the impact of climate change on total economic welfare, or about the distribution of that welfare. Those concerns are discussed below. 6.2 Total economic impacts** Our best estimate is that global warming of 2.5°C would make the average person feel as if she had lost 1.7% of her income. Figure 6.2 shows the 69 published estimates of the total economic impact of climate change. The vertical axis is given in Hicksian equivalent variation, the maximum share of income that someone would be willing to give up, without being worse off, to avoid climate change. These numbers should be read as follows: A global warming of 2.5 would make the average person feels as if she had lost 1.7% of her income—1.7% is the average of the 13 observations at 2.5 .

> Figure 6.1: Projected climate change (left panel) and alternative reasons for concern about climate change (right panel) 6.2.1 Methods The estimates in Figure 6.2 were derived as follows. Researchers used models—of every descrip- tion: process models, optimization models, equilibrium models, statistical models, spatial or temporal analogues—to estimate the many impacts of climate change for all parts of the world in their natural units—changes in crop yields, acreage of land inundated, number of lives lost, and so on—estimated the values of these impacts (using either market prices or the methods described in Chapter 5), multiplied the quantities and prices, and added everything up. This is the so-called enumerative method. The result is an estimate of the direct cost—price times quantity—of climate change. The direct cost is a poor approximation of the change in welfare, for instance because it ignores knock-on effects—such as forced migration affecting labour mar- kets and elections—but it is an approximation nonetheless. The enumerative approach omits interactions between sectors—such as a change in water resources affecting agriculture or sea level rise affecting tourist facilities—and it ignores the price changes that would be induced by changes in demand or supply. Other studies are based on the same physical impact estimates as in the enumerative studies above, but use these to shock a computable general equilibrium model. A computable general equilibrium model represents all markets of goods and services, as well as factors of produc- tion, within and between countries. These estimates thus include both partial equilibrium effects—the price of wheat goes up if its supply goes down—and general equilibrium effects in output, intermediate or input markets within and between economies —if wheat is more expen- sive, consumers have less money to spend on other commodities, and switch to other grains; farmers use more fertilizer and irrigation to compensate for adverse weather, and employ more labour; wheat imports increase. In this way, computable general equilibrium models include 
>  Figure 6.2: Alternative estimates of the global total annual impact of climate change. Symbols and colours denote different methods. The lines combine all estimates. more adaptation than other methods. The welfare measure used in these studies is typically the Hicksian Equivalent Variation, a proper welfare measure that is, within the model, measured exactly. However, computable general equilibrium models are based on the national accounts and thus exclude all non-market effects. This mismeasures agriculture—subsistence agriculture is omitted—and health—lost work, medicine and medical services are included, but feeling mis- erable is not. Some estimates elicit the views of (supposed) experts.1 The question was about the impact of climate change on global output, which can alternatively be interpreted as a measure of economic activity (but not welfare) and a measure of income (and thus welfare). Other estimates involve regressions of some sort of measure of economic welfare or activity on climate. Agricultural land prices, for instance, reflect the productivity of the land and hence the value of the climate that allows plants to grow. You do not just buy the land, but also the sun you expect to shine and the rain you expect to fall on it—this was first noted by David Ricardo in 1817. Price changes induced by climate change are used to estimate its direct cost, and thus approximate welfare changes. The estimated relationship between climate and household expenditure patterns has been used to approximate the change in total consumer surplus due to climate change. The estimated relationship between self-reported happiness on the one hand and climate and income on the other hand implies an estimate of the compensating variation, that is, the income change needed to compensate for a climate change while keeping welfare at its original level. The main advantage of the statistical method is that it is based on the equator—but by and large the negative impacts of climate change are concentrated in the developing economies.

> Poor countries are more vulnerable because a larger share of their eco- nomic activity is exposed to the weather. There are three reasons for this. First, poorer countries are more exposed. Richer countries have a larger share of their economic activities in manufacturing and services, which are typically shielded (to a degree) against the vagaries of weather and hence climate change. Agriculture and water resources are far more important, relative to the size of the economy, in poorer countries. Poor countries are more vulnerable to climate change because they tend to be hotter and closer to biophysical limits. Second, poorer countries tend to be in hotter places. This means that ecosystems are closer to their biophysical upper limits, and that there are no analogues for human behaviour and technology. Great Britain’s future climate may become like Spain’s current climate. The people of Britain would therefore adopt some of the habits of the people of Spain, and build their houses like the Spaniards do. Houses in Spain are designed to keep the heat out, whereas houses in the UK are built to keep the heat in. It makes sense to sleep through the heat of the day and, as digestion heats up the body, take the main meal in the cool of the night. If the hottest climate on the planet gets hotter still, there are no examples to copy from; new technologies will have to be invented, behaviour will have to be adjusted by trial and error. Poor countries are more vulnerable because they lack the means, the where- withal, and the political will to adapt. Third, poorer countries tend to have a limited adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity is the ability to adapt. It depends on a range of factors, such as the availability of technology and the ability to pay for those technologies. Sea level rise is a big problem if you do not know about dykes, or if you do but you cannot afford to build one. Flood protection has been known for millennia. Modern technology is at its summit in the Netherlands. Dutch engineers will happily share their expertise—for a rather steep fee. Adaptive capacity also depends on human and social capital. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but prevention requires that you are able to recognize problems before they manifest themselves (i.e., predict the future) and that you are able to act on that knowledge (i.e., analytical capacity is connected to policy implementation). Furthermore, the powers that be need to care about the potential victims. A country’s elite may be aware of the dangers of climate change and have the wherewithal to prevent the worst impacts, but if those impacts would fall on the politically and economically marginalized, or if the victims think that floods are due to the wrath of God rather than the incompetence of politicians, the elite may chose to ignore the impacts. 6.3 Impacts and development** The impacts of climate change are to a large degree determined by adaptation to climate change. Adaptation is constrained by adaptive capacity. The components of adaptive capacity largely coincide with aspects of development. Therefore, future vulnerability to climate change will be very different from current vulnerability. 
> This is perhaps best illustrated with malaria. Figure 6.4 shows a map of projected changes in malaria due to climate change. A few areas see a decline. Most areas see an increase in the incidence of malaria, and the darker the colour, the greater the increase. Malaria is introduced in the darkest areas. The mechanisms are as follows. Mosquitoes carry the disease. Mosquitoes are more active during warm weather. Mosquitoes need warm, still standing water to breed. A warmer and wetter world would thus see more mosquitoes. The malaria parasite develops faster in warm conditions. A warmer world would thus see more malaria.  Source: David J. Rogers and Sarah E. Randolph (2000), The global spread of malaria in a future, warmer world, Science, 289 (5485), 1763–1766. Graphic by Hugo Ahlenius. Figure 6.4: The impact of climate change on the malaria potential Figure 6.5 shows the current and past distribution of malaria. In the lighter areas, all the natural conditions for malaria are met, but it does not occur. Malaria is now only present in the darkest areas. Affluence is the difference between the light and dark colours. Indeed, people in countries with an average income above $3,000/person/year do not die from malaria (contracted in their home country). The mechanisms are as follows. Mosquitoes need warm, still standing water to breed. First, draining of wetlands, surfacing of roads and yards, and roofing of buildings have led to a dramatic decline in the number of small puddles of water in the developed world. Second, the large-scale application of DDT in the 1950s killed many mosquitoes. Third, the life cycle of the malaria parasite requires both human and mosquito hosts. If a human is treated for malaria, she does not get sick. But she does not become infectious either. Herd immunity results if a sufficient number of people in a population take malaria medicine. A course of malaria medicine costs a few hundred dollars, a small fortune in poor countries and small change in rich countries. Malaria is thus a disease of both poverty and climate. Figure 6.6 shows alternative projections of the future number of climate-change-induced malaria deaths. In blue, everything is kept constant except for the climate. The number of climate-change-induced malaria deaths increases from some 75,000 per year now to about

> 250,000 per year at the end of the century. Unfortunately, malaria records are not of sufficient quality to validate the model prediction of 75,000 climate deaths per year at present. The dotted lines indicate the uncertainty about the malaria model only (i.e., ignore the uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions or climate change). In the highest scenario, population growth is added and malaria numbers duly increase to about 750,000 deaths per year by 2100. This scenario is much quoted by environmentalists. In the third scenario, per capita income also grows. Malaria numbers first rise but later fall and malaria is eradicated around 2085 (in this model, with this parameterization, under this scenario). This scenario assumes that the global pattern of the relationship between health care and development holds for malaria. In two alternative scenarios, the communist pattern and the African pattern are used. Qualitatively, the results are the same: Malaria first goes up with warming and population growth before it falls with economic growth; in the communist pattern, the decline is sooner and faster, in the African pattern, the decline is later and slower. This illustrates the large uncertainty. As malaria is concentrated in Africa, the third scenario may be too optimistic. The final scenario adds another complication. It assumes that a malaria vaccine will be developed by 2020 (the deadline set by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; a first vaccine was announced at the end of 2011; a not very effective vaccine was put on the market in 2018, a much better vaccine in 2022). The vaccination campaigns against smallpox and polio took about 20 years. Using that number, malaria would be eradicated by 2040—not just climate-change-induced malaria, but all malaria.2 As poverty implies vulnerability, economic growth is an often superior way to reduce the impact of climate change. Figure 6.6 illustrates the relationships between the impacts of climate change and devel-
> 
> 2Figure 6.6 was developed in 1999, published in 2001. At that time, a malaria vaccine was considered unlikely if not impossible. The vaccine scenario was included as a development from leftfield. It is now real. Other things have happened too. A sustained effort, initiated by Gro Harlem Brundtland and George W. Bush, has halved malaria deaths, mostly through DDT, no longer banned, and bednets. Figure 6.6 is thus outdated. It is left standing as a warning against forecasters’ hubris.

> opment, as well as the uncertainty about those relationships. It also begs a policy question. Malaria is one of the reasons for concern about climate change. Greenhouse gas emission re- duction is not necessarily the best way to reduce the impact of climate change. Instead, money could be invested in medical technology or in public health care. This is the Schelling Conjec- ture.3 6.4 Adaptation and development** Poorer countries tend to be more vulnerable to climate change. The reasons include the struc- ture of the economy and a lack of adaptive capacity. Economic development is therefore a key component of adaptation policy. Nobelist Thomas Schelling argued that climate change im- pacts may fall faster if we invest money in development aid rather than in emission reduction, the Schelling Conjecture. International involvement in adaptation is obsolete except for the bureau- crats and consultants involved.

> Figure 6.8 summarizes the many estimates in a cumulative density function (CDF). The CDF shows that, if all published estimates are considered, there is 33% chance that the marginal damage cost is less that $200/tC and a 67% chance that it is greater.  Figure 6.8: The cumulative distribution function of the social cost of carbon for all published studies and for all published studies that use a particular pure rate of time preference The social cost of carbon is higher if the discount rate is lower, and its right tail is much fatter. Figure 6.8 also illustrates the power of one of the most important parameters: The pure rate of time preference (PRTP). The PRTP is the utility discount rate. It measures how much we care about the future for the sake of it being then not now (see Chapter 9). The sample is split into four: Estimates that use a PRTP of 0%, 1% or 3% are shown, while other estimates (a handful only) are ignored. The lower the discount rate you use, the more you care about the future, the more you care about climate change, and the higher the marginal damage cost. The median estimate, for instance, is around $50/tC for a 3% pure rate of time preference, almost $300/tC for 1% rate, and $650/tC or so for 0% rate. Table 6.1 shows some of the characteristics. With a PRTP of 3%, a carbon price of $40/tC can be justified. With a rate of 1%, a carbon price of $364/tC passes the benefit–cost test. The discount rate has another effect. The CDF for all estimates does not really converge to one, that is, there is a chance that the carbon tax should be greater than $1,000/tC. This

Numbers shown are for a 1% PRTP. is entirely driven by the estimates that use a PRTP of 0%. For a higher rate, the CDF rapidly converges to one. This means that the discount rate not only discounts the impacts of climate change, but also the uncertainty about the impacts. This is intuitive. As we look further into the future, the uncertainty becomes ever larger. We have a clear idea of what next year will be like, and a rough idea of the next decade, but only a foggy idea of the next century. The discount rate curtails how far we look into the future, and thus how much uncertainty we have to contend with.4 Figure 6.9 shows the same information as Figure 6.8 (for a pure rate of time preference of 3%), but now as a probability distribution function, the first partial derivative of the cumulative density function. Figure 6.9 splits the 3% PRTP sample into those studies that estimate the marginal damage cost along a no climate policy scenario, and those studies that impose a carbon tax equal to the marginal damage cost estimate. If the carbon tax equals the marginal damage cost, it is known as the Pigou tax (see Section 4.1). If a carbon tax is imposed, emissions fall and climate change is less of a problem. Therefore, the Pigou tax is less than the social cost of carbon: $154/tC versus $195/tC. Figure 6.9 and Table 6.1 also show that a carbon tax sharply reduces the uncertainty about the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. 6.6 The growth rate of the social cost of carbon*** The social cost of carbon should rise by some 2% per year. There are a number of studies of the evolution over time of the marginal damage costs of greenhouse gas emissions. The mean growth rate of the marginal damage cost is 2.2% per year, with a standard deviation of 1.0%. If we take all studies that use a no-policy scenario, the mean growth rate of the social cost of carbon is 2.3% with a standard deviation of 1.0%. If we take all studies that use an optimal scenario, the mean growth rate of the Pigou tax is 2.1% with a standard deviation of 1.0%. The difference in growth between the social cost of carbon and the Pigou tax is because climate policy affects climate change in the long run, but not in the short run. The Pigou tax is therefore not only lower than the social cost of carbon (cf. Figure 6.9), it also rises more slowly. There is a sharp contrast between dynamic efficiency and dynamic cost-efficacy. In the latter case, the price of carbon should rise at a rate that is about 0.6% higher than the rate of discount (see Section 4.6). In the former case, the price of carbon should rise at some 2.2% per year.
> 
> 4The marginal damage cost is the net present value of marginal damages in the future. The marginal damage is thus a summation of a series, and you would want it to converge, that is, its value should not change if you add an extra year at the end. If you use the low utility discount rate of 0.1% per year advocated by Lord Stern of Brentford, welfare impacts 12,000 years from today may still affect the net present value. Forecasting that far into the future is hard. I’ve been to year 3000. Nothing has changed but they live underwater. Twelve thousand years ago, humans were hunter-gatherers. Agriculture had yet to be invented.
