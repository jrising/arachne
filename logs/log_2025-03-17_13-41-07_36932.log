> I'm looking for a sea shanty to learn and sing to my son. He likes to hear about fake bad guys and have a bit of a story in the song. What do you suggest?
**assistant**:
> That sounds like fun! A sea shanty with a story about "fake bad guys" is a great choice for a child with an adventurous imagination like Austin's. Here are a couple of suggestions:
> 
> 1. **"Santy Anno" (also known as "Santiana")**: This shanty tells the tale of General Santa Anna, but it's historically fictionalized, so it doesn't deal with heavy themes. You can easily weave in some imaginative elements or pirate mentions to suit the theme of "fake bad guys."
> 
> 2. **"Blow the Man Down"**: This shanty is upbeat and often tells stories of sailors' adventures, including various shipboard scoundrels. You could augment the story to flesh out more humorous or comical "bad guys" as you sing along.
> 
> 3. **Invent Your Own Shanty**: You could create a new verse to an existing tune or make your own simple sea shanty that stars a fictional crew of mischievous cartoon-like pirates, ready for adventure but ultimately harmless. 
> 
> Consider making the stories grandiose and playful, with heroes like Austin outsmarting these gleeful neâ€™er-do-wells. It would be a delightful, personalized experience each time! If you want help crafting your own version, I'd be delighted to assist!
