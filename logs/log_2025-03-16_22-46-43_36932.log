The assessment itself is seen as a contribution to a larger activity to understand what aspects of social, economic, and political systems dampen or enhance regional and global systemic risks, and what governance mechanisms might be effective at reducing the systemic risks posed by climate change. The report uses a lens of ecosystem changes to explore systemic risks because there is an emerging, yet still nascent, literature on the dependence of human systems on, and risks posed to them by, ecosystems, which remains critical yet underexplored.
