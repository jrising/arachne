**user**:
> I have an external HD on my server that I want to share with all users on it. It's currently at /media/jrising/Data, but other users can't even see /media/jrising.
**assistant**:
> To share an external hard drive with all users on a server, you need to adjust the permissions settings. Follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Check the current permissions:** Use the `ls -l` command. It's important to see the current permissions before changing them. Type:
> ```bash
> ls -l /media/jrising
> ```
> The output should provide information on the permissions, ownership, and a file or directory name.
> 
> 2. **Change ownership:** Change the directory's owner to a user who should have r/w access. This is usually set to the root. 
> ```bash
> sudo chown root:root /media/jrising/Data
> ```
> 3. **Set permissions:** Set the directory permissions so that all users can read, write, and execute. Note that this will affect all subfolders and files in the directory. 
> ```bash
> sudo chmod ugo+rwx /media/jrising/Data
> ```
> `ugo+rwx` means `(u)ser`, `(g)roup`, `(o)thers` get +(add) read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions.
> 
> Check the permissions again to make sure they've been set correctly:
> ```bash
> ls -l /media/jrising
> ```
> 
> Now all users should be able to access the directory and its files.
> 
> **NOTE:** Setting `rwx` permissions for `ugo` can have security implications, as it allows anyone to modify the contents of the folder. Depending on your security needs, you might want to give the execute (`x`) permission only to a specific group of users.
**user**:
> Others cannot ls -l on /media/jrising/Data. They get "permission denied".
**assistant**:
> If other users are still unable to list the contents of the `/media/jrising/Data` directory using the `ls -l` command, it's possible that the issue is related to the permissions of the parent directory (`/media/jrising`). In order to access the contents of a directory, users also need to have appropriate permissions on its parent directories.
> 
> To address this, you can adjust the permissions of the parent directories to allow other users to navigate through the directory structure. Follow these steps:
> 
> 1. **Change ownership of the parent directory:** This step ensures that the parent directories are owned by the appropriate user or group. In this case, we'll assume the parent directory (`/media/jrising`) should be owned by the root user.
>    ```bash
>    sudo chown root:root /media/jrising
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Set permissions on the parent directory:** Grant read and execute permissions to the parent directory so that other users can traverse through it.
>    ```bash
>    sudo chmod ugo+rx /media/jrising
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Apply changes recursively:** Apply the ownership and permission changes recursively to all directories and files within `/media/jrising`. This ensures that the permissions are propagated to the child directories and files.
>    ```bash
>    sudo chown -R root:root /media/jrising
>    sudo chmod -R ugo+rx /media/jrising
>    ```
> 
> After making these changes, other users should be able to list the contents of `/media/jrising/Data` using the `ls -l` command. If they still encounter permission issues, double-check the ownership and permissions of the parent directories leading up to `/media/jrising/Data`.
