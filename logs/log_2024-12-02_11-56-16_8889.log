> How much should I budget for full-time (9 - 5pm) childcare in London for a 3 year old and a 5 year old?
**assistant**:
> Childcare costs in London can vary widely depending on the type of care, the location, and the specific provider. However, I can provide you with some general estimates.
> 
> 1. **Nursery Care**: For a 3-year-old, full-time nursery care in London typically ranges from £1,200 to £1,800 per month. However, prices can be higher in central London.
> 
> 2. **After-School Club**: For a 5-year-old in school, you might look into after-school clubs or programs. These can cost around £100 to £200 per week, but this can vary.
> 
> 3. **Childminders**: Hiring a registered childminder might be a more flexible option, typically costing around £7 to £10 per hour.
> 
> 4. **Nanny Share**: Another option is a nanny share, where you share a nanny with another family. This can cost around £11 to £15 per hour, which might be more affordable if split between two families.
> 
> These costs can be offset by the government's free childcare schemes, such as the 15 or 30 hours free childcare for 3- and 4-year-olds, depending on eligibility. Additionally, employers might offer childcare vouchers or similar benefits that can help reduce costs.
> 
> Make sure to also consider any additional costs, such as registration fees, meals, and activities, which some providers might charge separately.
