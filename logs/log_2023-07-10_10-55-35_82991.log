> I am using an ANOVA for variance decomposition with several predictors. Does the order of those predictors matter?
**assistant**:
> In a standard Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the order of predictors does not impact the results. An ANOVA computes statistics based on the variability within and between groups but does not take predictor order into account.
> 
> However, in a variation of ANOVA called Hierarchical or Sequential ANOVA, the order of predictors does matter. In this case, predictors are entered into the model in a specific sequence, allowing for an assessment of the change in explained variance attributable to each predictor. This type of ANOVA allows you to evaluate the unique contribution of each predictor after accounting for the previous ones in the sequence.
> 
> If you're doing a hierarchical/sequential ANOVA, the order of your predictors can affect the outcome, as each predictor is evaluated with respect to how much it adds to the prediction of the dependent variable after considering the effect of predictors added before it. This is not the case in a standard ANOVA.
> 
> In conclusion, for a typical ANOVA, the order of your predictors won't matter, but it does matter for hierarchical or sequential ANOVAs.
