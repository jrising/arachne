> Subject: Proposal for Splitting Dev Day into Two Separate Events
> 
> Dear Team,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. After giving it some thought, I am proposing a small change in our traditional Dev Day's format. Primarily, I would like to suggest we split up Dev Day into two separate pieces.
> 
> The first part would proceed to be a full-day event in NYC as planned, scheduled for December 12th. I believe this could be an excellent opportunity for us to convene, engage in in-depth discussions, and foster our usual collaborative spirit.
> 
> For the second part, let's hold off until January for a follow-up event, ideally at the BEEX space, provided it's available. I envision that the additional meeting will allow us to focus specifically on our Building Energy (BE) programs. The gap between the two events can give us some time to consolidate, reflect on our discussions from the first one, and then reinitiate with a more refined focus on the BE efforts at the January event.
> 
> My belief is that this division allows us to dedicate undivided attention towards two significant aspects of our work, rather than attempting to squeeze everything into a single day which may result in some points being overlooked in the rush.
> 
> I am keen to hear your thoughts on this. Let's discuss it further during our next team meeting, or feel free to email your inputs or any concerns back to me.
> 
> Thank you for your consideration.

> Best,

> Subject: Proposal to Split Dev Day into Two Parts with Key Participants' Involvement
> 
> Dear Team,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to suggest a restructuring of our upcoming Dev Day. I recommend dividing it into two distinct events to allow for a deeper dive into our topics of interest.
> 
> The first segment of Dev Day will take place as initially planned, consisting of a full day in NYC on December 12th. This day will serve as a comprehensive meeting for discussions, brainstorming, and collaborative sessions.
> 
> Following this, I propose scheduling a second meeting in January at the BEEX space, with a specific focus on our Building Energy (BE) programs. This additional gathering will provide us with the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of our BE initiatives and set a clear direction for our future efforts.
> 
> In order to ensure the success of these two events, I suggest the involvement of Alex from the communications team and Shubidah from the programs team. Both of their insights and expertise will be invaluable in shaping our discussions and outcomes.
> 
> Ideally, I would like to have Alex and Shubidah present for at least half of each day, if not the full duration. Their presence will help bridge the communication between teams and align program strategies with our overarching goals.
> 
> I am confident that this revised structure will enhance the productivity and effectiveness of our Dev Day sessions. I welcome your feedback on this proposal and look forward to discussing it further during our upcoming team meeting.
> 
> Thank you for your attention and collaboration in advance.

> 
> Dear Team,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to propose a revision to our upcoming Dev Day schedule in order to optimize our discussions and outcomes.
> 
> The new plan involves splitting Dev Day into two individual sessions. The first session will be a full-day event in NYC on December 12th, where we can engage in broader conversations and planning for our initiatives.
> 
> Subsequently, I suggest we hold a second meeting in January at the BEEX space, focusing specifically on our Building Energy (BE) programs. This follow-up session will allow us to dive deep into the details of our BE projects and chart a clear path forward.
> 
> To ensure the success of both sessions, it is imperative to have the participation of Alex from the communications team and Shubidah from the programs team. I recommend that they both attend for a minimum of half a day, ideally staying for the full duration of each event. Their valuable insights and perspectives will greatly contribute to the alignment of our communication strategies with program objectives.
> 
> By having Alex and Shubidah present throughout the gatherings, we can foster a more cohesive and integrated approach towards our goals.
> 
> I welcome your thoughts and feedback on this proposed adjustment. Let's discuss this further during our team meeting or feel free to share your comments via email as well.
> 
> Thank you for your attention to this matter. Your collaboration is highly appreciated.
