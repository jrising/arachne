> I am using the QuickMapServices plugin in QGIS to get a base map. I really like the ESRI National Geographic base map, but it's pixellated. Is there something similar that will show up as high resolution?
**assistant**:
> Yes, some maps provided by QuickMapServices plugins in QGIS can be of lower resolution, such as the ESRI National Geographic map, due to technical limitations. Here are some alternatives which may provide higher resolution base maps:
> 
> 1. **Google Maps**: QGIS comes with the option to add Google Maps as a base map layer. Google Satellite is a popular choice due to its high-resolution imagery and global coverage. Just make sure to respect their terms of use. 
> 
> 2. **Bing Maps**: Similar to Google Maps, Bing Maps offers a variety of base layers including Bing Aerial, which provides high-resolution aerial imagery.
> 
> 3. **OpenStreetMap**: While this isn't exactly the same map styling as National Geographic, the OpenStreetMap tiles generally have a good resolution, and they're free to use.
> 
> If you’re comfortable tinkering a bit more and need additional options, you might look into using a tool like **TileMill** or **Mapbox** to create your own custom-styled base map.
> 
> Finally, keep in mind the importance of setting the correct projection (CRS) for your project – this could also affect how pixelated your base maps appear.
