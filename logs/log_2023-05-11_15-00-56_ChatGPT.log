> I am renovating my academic office with $5000, and I am looking for suggestions on furniture to get. I have purchased a standing desk and a filing cabinet, and I already have metal bookcases, a whiteboard, and a small meeting desk with chairs. What else should I consider using the funds for?

> It sounds like you've already covered quite a few essentials for your academic office! Based on what you already have, here are some suggestions to consider:
> 
> 1. **Ergonomic Chair**: Even with a standing desk, you'll need a good chair for those times when you want to sit. Make sure it's adjustable and provides good lumbar support. 
> 
> 2. **Lighting**: Consider investing in good task lighting (such as a desk lamp) and ambient lighting to reduce eye strain and create a comfortable environment. You could also consider getting a SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) lamp if you're in a location with little sunlight.
> 
> 3. **Monitor and Monitor Stand**: If you use a computer often, a high-quality monitor can make a huge difference in your productivity and comfort. A stand or a monitor arm can help adjust the screen to the right height and reduce neck strain.
> 
> 4. **Keyboard and Mouse**: An ergonomic keyboard and mouse can help prevent wrist and hand strain.
> 
> 5. **Under-Desk Treadmill or Bike**: If you like to stay active, a small under-desk treadmill or bike can let you exercise while you work.
> 
> 6. **Acoustics**: If your office is a bit echoey, some sound-dampening materials like acoustic panels can be very helpful. 
> 
> 7. **Air Purifier**: If your office doesn't have great ventilation, an air purifier can help keep the air fresh and potentially reduce the spread of airborne germs.
> 
> 8. **Plants**: Some indoor plants can not only liven up the space but also help purify the air. They're also known to reduce stress and increase productivity.
> 
> 9. **Artwork/Decor**: Consider getting some art for the walls to make the space more pleasant and inviting. 
> 
> 10. **Small Fridge and Coffee Maker**: If you often work long hours, these can be nice conveniences. 
> 
> Remember, it's important to create a space that's not just functional, but also pleasant to spend time in. Investing in some of the items mentioned above can make your office a more comfortable, productive environment.
