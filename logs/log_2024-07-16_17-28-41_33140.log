> In Julia, can I specify that I only want a broadcasting (like function.(XX, yy)) to be with respect to one of the variables (XX here)?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can selectively broadcast over specific variables in Julia by using dot syntax only on the variable you wish to broadcast over. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> Assume you have a function `f` and two variables `XX` and `yy`. If you want to broadcast `f` only over `XX` and not `yy`, you can use the dot `.` syntax strategically:
> 
> ```julia
> result = f.(XX, Ref(yy))
> ```
> 
> In this example, `Ref(yy)` wraps `yy` in a `Ref` object, which prevents broadcasting over `yy`. Instead, only `XX` will be broadcasted.
> 
> Here is a practical example:
> 
> ```julia
> # Define a function
> f(a, b) = a + b
> 
> # Define variables
> XX = [1, 2, 3]
> yy = 10
> 
> # Broadcast over XX only
> result = f.(XX, Ref(yy))
> 
> # Output: [11, 12, 13]
> println(result)
> ```
> 
> In this case, each element of `XX` is added to `yy`, and the result is a new array `[11, 12, 13]`.
> 
> This way, you can control broadcasting behavior in a flexible manner.
