**user**:
> Do people call the ASSA annual conference "the AEAs"?
**assistant**:
> Yes, some people commonly refer to the Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA) annual meeting as "the AEAs." This is because the American Economic Association (AEA) is the most prominent member of the ASSA, and its events and sessions often form a large part of the annual meeting. However, using the term "the AEAs" might not fully acknowledge the participation of the many other organizations and disciplines represented at the conference.
