**user**:
> Is there a term for a person who has a Ph.D.? Doctor, but that sounds like a medical doctor.
**assistant**:
> People who have obtained their Ph.D. degree are often referred to as "Doctor" in academic, professional, and formal contexts. It's true that the term "Doctor" can be associated with medical practitioners, but it is also widely used to signify a person who has achieved the highest academic degree in their field.
> 
> If you want to make the academic distinction clearer, terms such as "Scholar" or "Academic" could work. It might also be fit to simply specify "Ph.D." after their name, such as "Dr. Smith, Ph.D.".
> 
> Another potential title could be "Doctor of Philosophy", which is the full term that "Ph.D." stands for, though it's rarely used in casual conversation.
> 
> Remember that the way a person with a Ph.D. wishes to be addressed can vary widely based on personal preference, cultural norms, and specific contexts. It's always best to ask the individual their preferred form of address if in doubt.
