> I'm extracting some content from a webpage using Selenium, but I don't want to keep most of the HTML content. But I do want to keep some of it-- links, images. But I want to drop all of the styling. How can I do that? Like, can I convert the Selenium content to markdown, keeping the stuff Markdown can show?
**assistant**:
> Absolutely, you can achieve that by first extracting the HTML content with Selenium, then processing it to convert it into Markdown format while retaining key elements like links and images, but dropping the styling. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach for you:
> 
> 1. **Extract the HTML content with Selenium**:
>    ```python
>    from selenium import webdriver
> 
>    # Set up the webdriver (make sure the appropriate webdriver is installed)
>    driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # or webdriver.Firefox(), etc.
>    driver.get("https://example.com")
> 
>    # Extract the HTML content
>    html_content = driver.page_source
>    driver.quit()
>    ```
> 2. **Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and drop the styling**:
>    ```python
>    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
> 
>    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
> 
>    # Remove all style tags and attributes
>    for style in soup.find_all("style"):
>        style.decompose()
>    for tag in soup.find_all(True):
>        del tag['class']
>        del tag['style']
>    cleaned_html = str(soup)
>    ```
> 3. **Convert cleaned HTML to Markdown using `html2text`**:
>    ```python
>    import html2text
> 
>    converter = html2text.HTML2Text()
>    converter.ignore_images = False  # To keep images in the markdown
>    converter.ignore_links = False   # To keep links in the markdown
>    converter.ignore_emphasis = True # To drop emphasis styling like <b> or <i>
> 
>    markdown_content = converter.handle(cleaned_html)
>    ```
> 
> This code will clean the HTML content by removing all the style tags and inline styles, and then convert it to Markdown while preserving the links and images.
> 
> Here's the complete script for clarity:
> 
> ```python
> from selenium import webdriver
> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
> import html2text
> 
> # Set up the webdriver (make sure the appropriate webdriver is installed)
> driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # or webdriver.Firefox(), etc.
> driver.get("https://example.com")
> 
> # Extract the HTML content
> html_content = driver.page_source
> driver.quit()
> 
> # Parse and clean the HTML
> soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
> 
> # Remove all style tags and attributes
> for style in soup.find_all("style"):
>     style.decompose()
> for tag in soup.find_all(True):
>     if 'class' in tag.attrs:
>         del tag['class']
>     if 'style' in tag.attrs:
>         del tag['style']
> 
> cleaned_html = str(soup)
> 
> # Convert cleaned HTML to Markdown
> converter = html2text.HTML2Text()
> converter.ignore_images = False  # To keep images in the markdown
> converter.ignore_links = False   # To keep links in the markdown
> converter.ignore_emphasis = True # To drop emphasis styling like <b> or <i>
> 
> markdown_content = converter.handle(cleaned_html)
> 
> print(markdown_content)
> ```
> 
> This script should provide you with a Markdown version of the webpage content with the specified requirements.
