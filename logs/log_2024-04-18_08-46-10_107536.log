**assistant**:
> Absolutely, James. Improving your fundraising meetings can be a game changer. Here are some strategies for you:
> 
> 1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Before the meeting, clearly define what you hope to achieve. This could be a specific fundraising target, or a softer goal like improving relationships with potential donors.
> 
> 2. **Know Your Audience**: Understand who you are meeting with. Research their interests, their history of giving, and their connection to your cause. This will allow you to tailor your pitch and your asks to their individual interests and motivations.
> 
> 3. **Tell Engaging Stories**: People connect with stories, not facts and figures. Use compelling stories that illustrate the impact of your work. These stories should evoke emotions and demonstrate the difference their support can make.
> 
> 4. **Be Specific**: Be clear about what you need funds for and how it will make an impact. General asks for support are less compelling than specific, tangible propositions.
> 
> 5. **Practice Your Pitch**: Your presentation should be professional and polished. Practice beforehand to ensure you're articulating your mission and needs as effectively as possible.
> 
> 6. **Engagement**: Make your meetings interactive. Invite questions, encourage discussion, and listen more than you talk.
> 
> 7. **Follow Up**: Always send a thank-you note after the meeting, even if they haven't yet committed to a donation. This keeps the line of communication open and shows your appreciation for their time.

> 8. **Prepare Your Technology**: Make sure your video conferencing platform works well ahead of time, and that you know how to use it. This includes understanding the mute and video buttons, screen sharing, and chat functions.
> 
> 9. **Mind Your Background**: A messy or unprofessional background can be distracting. Choose a clean, neutral background for your video calls.
> 
> 10. **Stay Focused**: Video meetings can make it easier to get distracted. Make sure you're focused on the meeting and the other participants.
> 
> Remember, fundraising is about building relationships. Be genuine, demonstrate passion for what you do, and focus on making a connection.
