> The person you're referring to is Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk from "The Epic of Gilgamesh," which is perhaps the oldest piece of literature in existence. Gilgamesh, along with his best friend Enkidu (the wild man you mentioned), went on several adventures. One of these was to the Cedar Forest, home of the gods, to slay the forest's guardian, the demon Humbaba (or Huwawa), and cut down the great tree.

> Enkidu was indeed wild until he was tamed, largely through the efforts of Shamhat, who is often interpreted as a sacred prostitute or temple priestess. This ancient Mesopotamian epic has thrilled audiences for thousands of years and continues to be studied for its profound insight into human nature and civilization.
