> In R dplyr, how can I summarize every column in the same way?
**assistant**:
> In `dplyr`, you can use the `summarize(across(...))` function to apply the same summary function to every column in a dataframe. Here's a general example of how you might use it:
> 
> ```r
> library(dplyr)
> 
> # Assuming `df` is your dataframe
> summary_df <- df %>%
>   summarize(across(everything(), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))
> ```
> 
> This example calculates the mean of every column, excluding `NA` values. You can replace `mean` with any other summary function you need, such as `sum`, `median`, or a custom function, and it will be applied across all columns.
