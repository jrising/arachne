**user**:
> I need to shorten a LaTeX document that has a page of references. My idea is to drop that page, and instead show in the main text just a brief parenthetical like (Rising et al. 2022, {\it QJE}). Can I do that automatically?
**assistant**:
> Yes, it is possible to automatically generate shortened parenthetical citations for your LaTeX document. One way to achieve this is by using a citation package like `natbib` or `biblatex` along with a bibliography style that supports abbreviated citations.
> 
> Here's a general approach to implement this in your LaTeX document:
> 
> 1. Start by including the appropriate citation package in the preamble of your LaTeX document. For example, if you are using `natbib`, add the following line:
> 
>    ```
>    \usepackage{natbib}
>    ```
> 
> 2. Specify the bibliography style that supports abbreviated citations. For `natbib`, you can use the `abbrvnat` style, which provides abbreviated author-year citations. Include the following line after loading the `natbib` package:
> 
>    ```
>    \setcitestyle{numbers,square,comma,abbrv}
>    ```
> 
> 3. In your main text, use the `\citep` command to generate parenthetical citations. For example:
> 
>    ```
>    According to \citep{Rising2022}, ...
>    ```
> 
> 4. In the final step, compile your LaTeX document with the appropriate bibliography command. For `natbib`, you would typically use `\bibliographystyle` and `\bibliography` commands. For example:
> 
>    ```
>    \bibliographystyle{abbrvnat}
>    \bibliography{your-bibliography-file}
>    ```
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to automatically generate shortened parenthetical citations in your main text without displaying the entire reference page.
> 
> Remember to replace `your-bibliography-file` with the actual filename of your bibliography file (e.g., `references.bib`). You may also need to adjust the citation style and bibliography file depending on your specific requirements.

**user**:
> I still get numerical references, like [9], rather than Rising et al. 2022, {\it QJE}), when I do that.
**assistant**:
> I apologize for the confusion. If you want to display author-year style citations instead of numerical references in your LaTeX document, you can modify the citation style to achieve the desired format. Here's an updated approach:
> 
> 1. In the preamble of your LaTeX document, include the `natbib` package with the desired citation style and options:
> 
>    ```latex
>    \usepackage[authoryear,round]{natbib}
>    ```
> 
>    The `authoryear` option specifies the author-year citation style, and the `round` option provides parentheses around the citation.
> 
> 2. Instead of using the `\citep` command, use the `\citeauthor` and `\citeyear` commands to manually create the desired parenthetical citation format. For example:
> 
>    ```latex
>    According to \citeauthor{Rising2022} (\citeyear{Rising2022}, \textit{QJE}), ...
>    ```
> 
>    This will display as "According to Rising et al. (2022, *QJE*), ..." in your document.
> 
> 3. Compile your LaTeX document as usual.
> 
> By following these updated steps, you should be able to generate the desired parenthetical citation format with the author-year style in your LaTeX document.
> 
> Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!
**user**:
> Is there no way to get the QJE to show up automatically?
**assistant**:
> Apologies for any confusion caused. If you wish to automatically include additional information, such as the journal name (e.g., "QJE"), you may need to customize the citation style or use a more specialized bibliography package.
> 
> One option is to use the `biblatex` package, which offers more flexibility in customizing citation styles. Here's an approach using `biblatex`:
> 
> 1. In the preamble of your LaTeX document, include the `biblatex` package with the desired citation style and options:
> 
>    ```latex
>    \usepackage[style=authoryear]{biblatex}
>    ```
> 
>    You can include additional options based on your specific requirements.
> 
> 2. Add the command `\addbibresource{your-bibliography-file.bib}` in the preamble to specify the bibliography file you're using.
> 
> 3. In the main text, you can use the `\parencite` command to generate the citation in parentheses. For example:
> 
>    ```latex
>    According to \parencite{Rising2022}, ...
>    ```
> 
> 4. Finally, compile your LaTeX document and ensure that the bibliography is included using the relevant commands (e.g., `\printbibliography`).
> 
> With `biblatex`, you can customize the citation style even further by modifying the bibliography style or using additional options. You may refer to the `biblatex` documentation for more details.
> 
> If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know!
