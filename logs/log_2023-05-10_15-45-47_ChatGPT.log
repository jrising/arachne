> Weather variation and climate change poses risks for agricultural production, particularly for perennial crops which represent an important form of semi-durable capital in many developing countries. However, misreporting of perennial crop yields and the effects of unobserved crop management decisions can undermine our understanding of these risks. For coffee production in Brazil, I show that extreme temperatures decrease yields, but also reduce reported harvest area due to die-off and selective harvesting by farmers.  The marginal damages from extreme temperatures on production is twice their effect on reported yields, since reported yields are calculated using harvested area rather than (unobserved) bearing area. By incorporating these effects into a structural econometric framework, the effects of management decisions can be distinguished.  Accounting for hidden dynamics reveals that both a greater direct effect of extreme temperatures on biophysical yields and a die-off effect with multi-year consequences.

> Perennial crops are an important semi-durable capital base for many developing countries.  However, the dynamics of their production remain poorly understood, with the central challenge of unobserved time-series of yields, heterogeneous ages, and farmer decisions.  These issues are tightly interrelated, and highlight the importance of two hidden processes that emerge from farmer-environment interactions: selective harvesting decisions and die-off dynamics. The elucidation of these effects requires a merging of the perennial supply and statistical yield literatures, applied here to coffee production in Brazil.  Combined, these techniques allow for a full accounting of the effects of prices, weather, and their interactions for a wide range of perennial crops.

> Variations in weather and the challenges posed by climate change significantly impact agricultural production, especially for perennial crops which serve as a critical semi-durable capital base in numerous developing countries. Yet, inaccuracies in reporting perennial crop yields and the unobserved consequences of crop management decisions can distort our comprehension of these risks. In the context of Brazilian coffee production, this paper demonstrates that extreme temperatures not only reduce yields, but also cause a decrease in reported harvest area due to plant die-off and selective harvesting by farmers. As such, the marginal damages from extreme temperatures on production are twice as high compared to their impact on reported yields, given that the latter are calculated based on harvested area rather than the (unobserved) bearing area.

> In addressing these dynamics, which include the poorly understood interrelation between unobserved time-series of yields, heterogeneous ages, and farmer decisions, the study merges perennial supply and statistical yield literatures. This approach aids in illuminating two obscured processes that result from farmer-environment interactions: selective harvesting decisions and die-off dynamics. By integrating these elements into a comprehensive structural econometric framework, the study can differentiate the effects of management decisions. This robust analysis unveils that extreme temperatures have a larger direct effect on biophysical yields and a multi-year die-off effect. Moreover, it allows for the thorough examination of the influence of price and weather variations, and their interactions, on a wide range of perennial crops.

> Weather variation and climate change pose risks for agricultural production, particularly for perennial crops that are a vital semi-durable capital resource in many developing countries. However, the misreporting of perennial crop yields and the effects of unobserved crop management decisions, including time-series of yields, heterogeneous ages, and selective harvesting, can distort our understanding of these risks. In the context of Brazilian coffee production, I demonstrate that extreme temperatures not only decrease yields but also reduce the reported harvest area due to die-off and selective harvesting by farmers. The marginal damages from extreme temperatures on production are twice their effect on reported yields, given that reported yields are calculated using harvested area rather than the (unobserved) bearing area. By integrating these dynamics into a structural econometric framework that merges perennial supply and statistical yield literatures, the differential effects of management decisions become distinguishable. This approach reveals a greater direct effect of extreme temperatures on biophysical yields and a multi-year die-off effect, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between prices, weather, and their interactions across a range of perennial crops.
