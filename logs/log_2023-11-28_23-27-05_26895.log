> The following is a project summary for a grant proposal:
> ---
> How does healthy nutrition depend upon a healthy environment? This project investigates how climate change could undermine human health, through its impacts on food produced on land and in the ocean. Building upon established relationships with stakeholders in West Africa (Senegal and Nigeria), we will identify health risks for vulnerable populations, particularly small-holder farmers and fishers.
> 
> This work is grounded in a careful mapping of the consequences of climate change on agriculture (NASRDA partner) and fisheries (IMR and CRODT partners), along with their supporting ecosystem services and critical economic, social and health impacts on human populations (UD partner). We will expand the understanding of the impacts of extreme weather, elevated CO2, soil fertility and fertilization on crop production and nutrition; the role of ocean warming, deoxygenation and acidification, and degraded habitats on fisheries harvesting and nutrition; and the consequences to the local and national food security, nutrition, poverty reduction, and achievement of the SDGs. Building on this work, we will investigate how changes in food provision can threaten human health. Food scarcity, due to crop failure and weakened fisheries, can lead to malnutrition; foods deficient in essential nutrients like protein, zinc, and iron can lead to nutrient deficiency; and increased harmful algal blooms can result in shellfish poisoning.
> 
> We will co-create tools and relevant datasets that support stakeholders in developing better resilience to production, nutrition and health risks. We will analyze, describe and report the chain of dependencies between climate change, the environment, economies of food production and food provision, and human health into a Food Security Futures Explorer, including mitigation, risk management and adaptation policy options.
> 
> We will provide an actionable understanding of the dependencies between (1) climate change, (2) ecosystem services and habitat integrity, (3) agriculture and fishery production, (4) nutritious food provision through the food system, and (5) outcomes for human health. Our case studies are Senegal and Nigeria. We will first design theoretical and empirical bioeconomic models to study (1) – (3); second, analyze econometrically the consumption of staple crops and fish and the nutrient composition of food in local communities and how it is met by the supply; and third, deduce the effects on their health.
> 
> Existing research suggests climate-driven losses to agricultural production for staple crops across the developing world, and to marine ecosystems by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean, affecting reproduction and distribution of fish stocks, and fishery harvest productivity. We will investigate the role of the ecosystem services in supporting food production. Agriculture depends on ecosystems for soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification, while fisheries need water quality, biodiversity, and balanced food webs.
> 
> The actions of farmers and fishers can also undermine environmental sustainability, particularly as global environmental change disrupts their long-standing management practices. To address producer behaviors and co-develop new adaptation practices, we will apply decision-science approaches to account for economic benefits and sustainable yields, considering climate change events, costs and benefits of mitigating, adapting and migrating, and social equity goals. We will determine to what degree small-holders involved in food production are critical to food security and nutrition, health, livelihoods, and local and national economies; and how they will be affected by climate change. Our Food Security Futures Explorer will contain extensive information about adverse environmental changes to serve as an early warning system and for evaluating stakeholder adaptation options.

> I am now outlining the full proposal, which is divided into the following segments:
> 
> - Executive summary (2 pg)
> - Project Description (10 pg) - includes (1) Background, (2) Research Plan and (3) Competence and expertise; complementarities of consortium; transdisciplinary approaches; global geographical diversity.
> - Management Plan (5 pg)
> - Impact, engagement, and dissemination plan (5 pg)
> 
> For the "Research Plan" and the "Impact, engagement, and dissemination
> plan", can you propose a set of Work Packages, and which institutions
> will lead and contribute to each? In designing these work packages, we
> want to show collaboration but also to provide UD, IMR, CRODT, and
> NASRDA opportunities to lead (so, for example, fisheries and agriculture should probably be split in different WPs). Here are descriptions of the PI's roles
> in the project from the various institutions:
> 
> James Rising (UD): Coordination, health and nutrition evaluation
> 
> Oluwaseun Adeluyi (NASRDA): I will be in charge of acquiring crop data
> at satellite scale and proximal scale and processing the data using artificial intelligence and remote sensing.

> efforts throughout the duration of the project across all
> collaborators and project partners. He will lead modeling and mapping
> efforts of food production, food supply chain, and nutritional
> outcomes across project countries. He will oversee and coordinate all
> geospatial capacity-strengthening efforts.
> 
> Elizabeth Fournier (UD): I will provide support to the study of
> vulnerable populations affected by the identified changes in
> agriculture and fisheries production. My focus will be on health
> outcomes and the risk or protective factors that may lead to disparate
> outcomes.
> 
> Jennifer Horney (UD): I will provide expertise around hazard events
> associated with climate change and their human health impacts and
> potential impacts on food production and other systems and services.
> 
> Marian Kjellevold (IMR): I am leading the Nutrition and Food Safety theme in the FAO Nansen Programme. As part of this
> program we have sampled and analysed a range of fish species from Senegal for nutrients and food
> safety parameters. The work is performed in collaboration with local scientist withing the field of
> nutrition. I have also lead other projects sampling and analysing fish from fish markets in e.g. Ghana.
> This knowledge and experience will be of value for this project.

> Fambaye NGOM (CRODT): a fishery biologist researcher
> 
> Ndèye Fatou Ndiaye (ITA): We will expect to understand how climate
> change can affect the environment and create consequences national
> food security, nutrition. Emphaze the link beween climate change and
> nutrition and the impact of insufficient or poor quality harvests on
> the nutritional status (macro and micronutrients) of target groups. We
> hope also to boost and scale up climate action in order to strengthen
> the resilience of populations in Senegal whose system of farming and
> fishing are very sensitive to rainfall, temperature and severe
> droughts.
> 
> Erik Olsen (IMR): Mapping consequences of climate change on fisheries and seafood systems. Contribute to development,
> testing and application of the bioeconomic models. Contribute to the analysis and capacity development
> in case study regions (Senegal and Nigeria).
> 
> Marek Ostrowski (IMR): Climate research focused on assessing the
> trends and ecological significance of extreme climatic events in the
> seaboard countries of the Gulf of Guinea and Southern Canary Large
> Marine Ecosystems.
> 
> Geir Ottersen (IMR): Data analysis, impacts of climate on fish and
> other marine resources.
> 
> ABDOULAYE SARRE (CRODT): To provide information and fisheries data
> gathered through my career to contribute understanding the
> implications of climate change on food security in North West Africa.
> 
> In designing these WPs, consider that we need stakeholders involved in the research plan, not just dissemination. And I think that the bioeconomic modeling will be inseparable from the agriculture and fisheries production. Also, I think that the food security futures explorer is going to be the main tool outcome.
