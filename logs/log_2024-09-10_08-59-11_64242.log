> Looking to make a real impact on the environment? UD's Master of Science in Environmental Science and Management program may be the perfect fit for you. Our curriculum is designed to provide you with the skills and knowledge you need to address pressing environmental challenges, including climate change, fisheries, land use, and just energy transition.
> 
> This professional degree equips students with practical decision-making and management skills applicable to jobs in the environmental sector.
> 
> Students graduating with the Master of Science in ESM will be prepared to become environmental planners, environmental scientists, project managers, and environmental compliance specialists at all levels of government and in the private sector.
> 
> The capstone is a central part of the student experience. It is designed to address a specific real-world policy problem and is sponsored by an outside client. Students work in small groups on the assigned project using skills and knowledge acquired in the classroom. The outside sponsor can be at the local, national, or international level and might, for example, include agencies such as Delawareâ€™s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the World Bank, or the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. At the beginning of your second year, ESM faculty will find sponsors who need a talented group of graduate students to assist them with a real-world project that can be completed in one semester. Deliverables could include a report, presentation, budget, or work plan. Sponsors change from year to year. Each capstone group will be advised by at least one ESM faculty member.
> 
> Capstones reflect the applied nature of this program and will prepare students for working in government, non-profit, and for-profit organizations. It is a 3-unit course (MAST 664 Environmental Issue Capstone) in your last semester. The capstone course is only open to students in the MS in Environmental Science and Management and the MS in Environmental Economics. Students entering the capstone course will be required to take Decision Tools for Policy Analysis, MAST 663/UAPP 663, in the preceding semester. Capstone projects will develop and build practical research, collaboration, and communication skills that employers value.
