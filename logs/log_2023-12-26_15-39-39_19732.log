> In general, the entropy of a mixture distribution (like the one you're describing) would not be a simple weighted average of their individual entropies. If this were the case, mixing random variables would not create any new uncertainty, which contradicts the intuition behind entropy as a measure of uncertainty.
> 
> There is no simple formula to calculate the entropy of a mixture distribution directly from the entropies of the component distributions. The mixing process can create new uncertainty, and the entropy of the mixture might be larger than that of any individual component. Therefore, you would need to calculate the entropy of the mixture distribution directly.
