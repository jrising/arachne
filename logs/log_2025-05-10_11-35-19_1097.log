> I remember a music video being released by the Beatles (or Abbey Road), long after the band had broken up. It featured someone like Lennon singing but faded like a ghost, because they had pieced together his singing with later production. This was around 1995, I think. What was that?

> You're thinking of "Free as a Bird," the song released in 1995 by The Beatles. It was part of their "Anthology" project, which included a series of albums, a television documentary, and a book.

> "Free as a Bird" was originally a demo recorded by John Lennon in 1977, which the remaining Beatles—Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—completed by adding instrumentation, vocals, and production. The music video for the song creatively used archival footage and editing to give the impression of Lennon being present, yet ghostly, fitting your description. It was a fascinating way to bring a part of Lennon "back to life" and reunite the band, even if just technically.
