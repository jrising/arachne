**assistant**:
> You can check if your DreamHost server has Redis available by using the following steps:
> 
> 1. **Access the server**: Log into your DreamHost server via SSH. Typically you'll do this with a command that looks something like this: `ssh username@your.domain.com`
> 
> 2. **Check for Redis**: Once logged in, you can check for Redis by typing the command `redis-cli`. This command would bring up the Redis command line interface if Redis is installed.
> 
> 3. If Redis is installed, you should see a response like this:
>     ```
>     127.0.0.1:6379>
>     ```
>    This represents the Redis command prompt, which means Redis is installed and running.
> 
> 4. If Redis is not installed, you'll receive something similar to `command not found` message.
> 
> Keep in mind that if you don't have Redis installed, you might need to install it yourself, or ask DreamHost support if they can do this for you, depending on your hosting plan. Also note that using Redis on a shared hosting plan might violate your hosting agreement due to excessive use of server resources, so itâ€™s typically used on VPS, dedicated, or DreamCompute plans.
