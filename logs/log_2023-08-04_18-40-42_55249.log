> I added a PDF to my Zotero library, but I don't see any citation information or fields where I can add it. Just a filename and link. How can I make a citation for this?

> Zotero has an excellent feature for extracting citation information from PDFs. Here are the steps you need to perform:
> 
> 1. **Retrieve Metadata for PDF**
> 
>    If you've added a PDF to your Zotero library, you can right-click it (control-click on Mac) and select `Retrieve Metadata for PDF`. Zotero will automatically attempt to retrieve information about your PDF and create a new record.
> 
>     If metadata can't be found, Zotero will just keep the PDF as an attachment under 'My Library'. 
> 
> 2. **Manually Adding Metadata**
> 
>    If Zotero can't find the metadata for your PDF, you can add this information manually to create a full citation. 
> 
>    - Right-click the PDF in your library, then click `Create Parent Item`.
>    - This will create a new item associated with your PDF. Click on this new item.
>    - On the right-hand side, you'll see fields where you can enter information like `Author`, `Title`, `Publication`, and `Year`. Fill in these fields as fully as possible based on your knowledge of the source.
> 
> By following these steps, you should be able to generate citation information for your PDF within Zotero. Keep in mind that not all PDFs will have extractable metadata. If Zotero is unable to retrieve metadata and you aren't sure about the source details, I suggest searching for the document online to get the required citation information.
