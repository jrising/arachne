**user**:
> In google sheets, I have a column of names, and somewhere else I have a column of names and with each an associated column of values. How can I pull in the values for each name, by looking up the name in the second dataset?
**assistant**:
> You can accomplish this using the `VLOOKUP` function in Google Sheets which allows for vertical lookups by searching for specific information in your spreadsheet. The syntax for `VLOOKUP` is:
> 
> ```plaintext
> VLOOKUP(search_key, range, index, [is_sorted])
> ```
> 
> - `search_key` is the value to search for. This would be the cell containing the name you want to find the value for.
> - `range` is the range of cells to search in. Make sure the first column is the one containing the names.
> - `index` is the column number in the range containing the return value. If your value is in the 2nd column of the range, you would use 2.
> - `is_sorted` is whether the first column in range is sorted. Use `false` for an exact match.
> 
> Here's an example:
> 
> If you have names in column A and the values in column B, and you want to look up the name from cell `D2`:
> 
> ```plaintext
> =VLOOKUP(D2, A:B, 2, FALSE)
> ```
> 
> This will look for the value of `D2` in column A and return the corresponding value from column B.
> 
> For the case where your names and values are in different sheets, you just need to specify the sheet name in the range. Let's say the sheet name is 'Sheet2':
> 
> ```plaintext
> =VLOOKUP(D2, 'Sheet2'!A:B, 2, FALSE)
> ```
> 
> Remember to replace "D2", "A:B" and "Sheet2" with your own identifiers as appropriate.
**user**:
> In google sheets, how can I color a row based on a categorical value?
**assistant**:
> In Google Sheets, you can use conditional formatting to color a row based on a categorical value. Conditional formatting allows you to apply formatting rules to cells based on specified criteria.
> 
> To color a row based on a categorical value, follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Select the range of cells that you want to apply the conditional formatting to. For example, if your data starts in row 2 and extends across multiple columns, you might select the range A2:Z.
> 
> 2. Go to the menu bar and click on "Format" and then select "Conditional formatting."
> 
> 3. In the Conditional format rules pane that appears on the right side, select "Format cells if" from the drop-down menu.
> 
> 4. In the first drop-down menu, choose "Custom formula is" and enter the formula that determines when the row should be highlighted.
> 
>    For example, let's say you have a categorical value in column A, and you want to color the entire row if the value in column A is "Category1". You would use the following formula:
> 
>    ```
>    =$A2="Category1"
>    ```
> 
>    Note that the dollar sign ($) before the "A" in the formula makes sure that the column remains constant while the row number adjusts as you apply the formatting to different rows.
> 
> 5. Click on the "Formatting style" button to choose the desired formatting options, such as background color or font color.
> 
> 6. Click "Done" to apply the conditional formatting rule.
> 
> Now, whenever the value in column A matches the specified category, the entire row will be formatted according to the chosen formatting style.
> 
> You can repeat these steps to add additional rules for different categories or conditions as needed.
