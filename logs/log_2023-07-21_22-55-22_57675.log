> Thank you for reaching out. You sound like you would be good candidate for [PROGRAM]. However, funding is always a constraint in our ability to take students. I would encourage you to apply in plenty of time for Fall admission (by the end of the calendar year) so that you can be considered for any available funds.

> Dr. Rising,
> Greetings! I hope all is well with you. I obtained a master's degree in Finance and Banking from Begum Rokeya University, Bangladesh. I am extremely enthusiastic about PhD in Environmental Economics at University of Delaware, USA.
> I have reviewed your research profile and recent articles, especially about confounding adaptation in perennial climate damages. Your research area — Food System and Climate Change — has comprehensively held my research interest. I have approximately four years of experience as a research assistant in the fields of economics and finance. Now I wish to work under your guidance to acquire cutting-edge scientific research and analytical skills. 
> 
> I have attached my curriculum vitae herein for initial review.
> 
> Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

> Dear Md. Emran Hosen,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out, your academic background and research interest in the intersection of Food Systems and Climate Change align very well with the work we do here. 
> 
> It sounds like you are primarily interested in our Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. This program could indeed be an excellent fit for you, especially given your prior experience and interest in the intersection of economic, environmental, and policy issues.
> 
> However, funding is always a challenge. Limited funding is available for this Ph.D. program and I encourage you to apply in plenty of time for Fall admission (by the end of the calendar year), so that you can be considered for any available funds.
> 
> My own research in interdisciplinary quantitative modeling and climate change risks could certainly benefit from your unique perspective and I would be excited to have you contribute to our program. 
> 
> As a next step, I would encourage you to review the specific requirements for the application to the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics and begin preparing your materials accordingly. You can find up-to-date information on the program and application process [here](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/).
> 
> Thank you for considering the University of Delaware for your continued academic pursuits. I look forward to potentially working together to address the complex and pressing issues surrounding climate change and its impact on food systems.
