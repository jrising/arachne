> I'm writing a story that takes place in Salem, MA in 1657. My ancestor, also named James, has just arrived in the city and is about to meet his future wife, Elizabeth. He doesn't know it yet, but she's a witch. I think we'll show her animal-based powers soon, but first I need to just her to show herself as an independent-minded woman when they first meet. Maybe with a little rom-com misunderstanding too. Any suggestions?

> That sounds like a delightful story! Establishing Elizabeth's independent spirit in her first meeting with James can set a compelling tone for their relationship. Here’s a scene you might consider:

> As James made his way through the bustling marketplace of Salem, he was preoccupied with the task of finding his footing in this new town. He paused near a lively stall adorned with vibrant fabric, when he heard a spirited voice argue, "I assure you, this turkey tail fabric is the finest you'll find this season!"
> 
> Intrigued, James turned to see a woman with an air of confidence, seemingly negotiating fiercely with a merchant. Her auburn hair caught in the wind, Elizabeth barely glanced at him before refocusing on her task.
> 
> James moved closer, pretending to inspect the fabrics, but Elizabeth noticed his gaze. Misinterpreting his interest, she flashed him a playful, conspiratorial smile and said loud enough for all to hear, "See, even this gentleman admires the quality!"
> 
> Caught off-guard, James fumbled, trying not to appear the fool. "Why, yes, indeed. Never seen the like," he stammered, completely unaware of the fabric’s worth.
> 
> Elizabeth, sensing his discomfort, leaned towards him slightly, whispering, "Next time, just nod. They fold easier."
> 
> Their eyes met briefly, and in that moment, James saw not just the mischief but a depth—a self-assuredness that sparked his curiosity.
> 
> As Elizabeth gathered her newly-purchased fabric and turned to leave, a small sparrow swooped down to catch a ribbon she had inadvertently dropped. "Sage, you rascal!" she called to the bird, which chirped indignantly in response.
> 
> Stunned, James watched the bird fly up and circle back, dropping the ribbon neatly into Elizabeth’s hands before settling on her shoulder. James, too entranced by the spectacle to speak, could only marvel as she walked away, leaving him with a hint of mystery and the realization that he had met someone truly remarkable.

> This scene sets the stage for a relationship built on curiosity and respect. It introduces Elizabeth’s independent streak, her knack for clever negotiation, and hints at her witchy connection with animals. Plus, you have the added humor and charm of the fabric misunderstanding. What do you think?
