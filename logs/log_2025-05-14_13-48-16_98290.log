> If your step-father enjoyed the Culture series, he might appreciate other science fiction novels that blend rich world-building with philosophical and sociopolitical themes. Here are a few recommendations:
> 
> 1. **"The Expanse" series by James S.A. Corey** - This series starts with "Leviathan Wakes" and features a complex, immersive universe with a focus on political intrigue and human interaction in space, not unlike the Culture series.
> 
> 2. **"The Broken Earth" trilogy by N.K. Jemisin** - Beginning with "The Fifth Season," these books offer a gripping narrative, exploring themes of power, oppression, and resilience, set in a fantastically imaginative world.
> 
> 3. **"Diaspora" by Greg Egan** - Known for his hard science fiction, Egan explores concepts of identity and consciousness in a future where humans have transitioned into digital beings—a theme somewhat reminiscent of the Culture’s advanced civilizational backdrop.
> 
> 4. **"Red Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson** - This is the first book of the Mars trilogy, providing a detailed and scientifically plausible exploration of colonizing and terraforming Mars, accompanied by rich social and political considerations.
> 
> 5. **"The Left Hand of Darkness" by Ursula K. Le Guin** - This classic is a deep dive into themes of gender and society in an alien culture, told through evocative prose and profound humanistic insights.
> 
> Each of these choices combines complex characters, societal issues, and thought-provoking scenarios, much like Iain M. Banks's Culture series. I hope one of these suggestions resonates with your step-father!
