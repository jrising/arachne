> The potential environmental impacts of the construction, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind projects are important to consider in the siting of offshore wind turbines. Potential impacts include avian mortality and displacement, habitat displacement, acoustic impacts on marine mammals and sea turtles, disruption of migratory routes, and sensitive fish habitat disturbance, including impacts on endangered, threatened, and rare species. Data on the distribution and abundance of endangered, threatened, and protected species were compiled to evaluate the use of the marine environment by wildlife that may be affected by offshore wind development. Information on abundance, migration and residency, and extent of habitat can be analyzed for geographical overlap and the degree to which biologically significant impacts and dislocation of competing users may occur. From a scientific standpoint, biologically significant impacts can be considered to individuals or to populations. Impacts to individuals occur when the animal’s ability to grow, survive, and reproduce is compromised, while population-level effects can affect the viability of the species (National Research Council, 2005). Here, it is logical to consider biologically significant impacts at the population level, as many activities in the ocean can impact individuals and not every biologically significant impact to an individual will necessarily trigger the preparation of an EIS (as opposed to an EA) under NEPA. Further, while wildlife protection laws regulate impacts to individuals, they focus management attention at the population level. For example, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) ensures that stocks, or interbreeding groups of the same species, remain above the optimal sustainable population (16 USC 1361 et seq.) The Endangered Species Act (ESA) likewise manages for species, subspecies or distinct population segments (16 USC
> 1532). Lastly, benefits from CO2 reductions resulting from decreased use of fossil fuels are generally thought of on a large scale, in which benefits to wildlife would be assessed on a population level rather than individual level. From a management perspective, it is important that we consider impacts to groups larger than the individual as we look towards long-term viability of each species.
> Marine Mammals
> A growing body of research has accumulated regarding the implications of construction and operation of offshore wind projects on marine mammals. Studies have been conducted throughout the planning, construction, and post-construction monitoring stages of project development at several European offshore wind locations. In summary, research has shown that the primary concern with respect to marine mammals is the effect of noise during pre-construction surveys, turbine installation, turbine operations, and decommissioning. Specifically, surveys characterizing the geophysical conditions, employing side-scan sonar and seismic seafloor profiling devices may produce harmful sounds during surveys (Richardson et al., 1995). In addition, installing turbine foundations may require the use of a pile driver, which produces intense sounds in the immediate vicinity (Bailey et al., 2010, Brandt et al., 2011, Dong Energy, 2006, Nedwell & Howell, 2004; Nedwell et al., 2007; Tougaard et al., 2008). If regulators and developers do not account for noise, it may cause behavioral changes, hearing loss, injury, disruption of communication, navigation, and displacement (Bates et al., nd). Marine mammals do not respond to sound uniformly, and therefore effects from sound will vary with noise intensity, frequency, and duration (Richardson et al., 1995). Nonetheless, NMFS has established uniform guidelines as to when any species is expected to exhibit a behavioral (Level A harassment) or injury (Level B harassment) resulting from exposure to the sound (70 Fed. Reg. 1871-1875, 11 January 2005). Impacts from installation vessels, habitat changes, and other impacts may also be of concern. One effective mitigation strategy is to advise the siting of turbines with consideration for the temporal and spatial habitat use by marine mammals (Gordon et al., 2007; Nehls et al., 2007; Wursig et al., 2000).
> The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (NARWC) database (Kenney, 2001) was developed in 1986 around the core of the Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program database (CETAP) (CETAP, 1982). The database has been continually updated and actively managed, incorporating aerial and shipboard survey data and opportunistic sightings from a variety of contributing organizations, as well as from surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The NARWC database, which includes data from the region from the Nova Scotian shelf to Florida, is probably the most extensive long-term collection of survey and sighting data for any comparable area of the world. Records from this database were obtained with confidentiality agreements to not release the underlying data. All marine mammals have been assessed for overlap with potential offshore wind development sites. Importantly, the most commonly sighted species within the study area have been corrected for effort, therefore areas that do not show sightings are areas that have been searched and no animals have been found. These data show areas where marine mammals have been sighted both on survey and opportunistically, providing indications of habitat preferences and areas frequently used in residence and migration. Although correcting for effort is useful, detection of marine mammals can be missed, and errors can occur in species identification. Therefore, the effort-corrected sightings cannot be considered the only locations where marine mammals may be present, but are the best representations of where species are likely to have been present.
> To assess areas frequently used by marine mammals, the dataset was further refined by including sightings within the north/south bounds of the study area, and determining sighting frequency by species for all years. Any species with over 50 sightings for all years combined was chosen as an indicator species for mapping: bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatis), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus), pilot whale (Globicephala sp.), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), and unidentified large whale. The sightings of these species are displayed as aggregate over all years, as well as individually by species. All sightings indicated as strandings were removed from the dataset before mapping. Point data were converted to raster in order to display relative sighting frequency. The raster data is displayed in 5-minute by 5-minute grid cell resolution. Please refer to Map 4.
> Distribution of marine mammals in the mid-Atlantic varies spatially and temporally. Selected marine mammals included here have a relatively high number of sightings in the study area (i.e., over 50 sightings, all years combined). The six selected species are displayed in Table 1. In addition to the species selected, records of unidentified large whales are displayed, because a large number of sightings were recorded in the study area, even though the specific species was not identified.

> Marine mammal species are distributed throughout the study area, with a greater number of sightings beyond the continental shelf break. Many of the combined records are from summer and spring sightings, although both fall and winter occurrences are substantial. Approximately 4% of the selected species observed in the study area are inshore of the 35-meter contour, 96% were sighted beyond the 35-meter contour. Federal protections for each of these species come from the MMPA, which places a moratorium on “takes” of marine mammals. Some marine mammal populations are also protected under the ESA, which safeguards threatened and endangered species and their critical habitats. Under MMPA, ‘take’ is defined as "harass, hunt, capture, kill or collect, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, kill or collect" (16 USC 1361 et seq.). The definition under the ESA is similar, although somewhat more broad. Takes of endangered species are automatically prohibited under the ESA, although takes of threatened species must be specifically prohibited on a species by species basis (16 USC 1533 et seq.) Federal agencies granting permits or leases or other approvals (e.g., BOEM or USACE) and wind project developers, as appropriate, must consult with the proper federal regulatory agency – NOAA/NMFS and/or US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regarding suitable measures to minimize, mitigate and/or prevent disruption and takes of these species. Potentially detrimental impacts to marine mammals are often unavoidable during some aspects of offshore wind development, and therefore, Incidental Take Permits can be acquired under both MMPA and ESA for unintentional takes that are incidental to the activity.
> State and permitting agencies can utilize these distribution maps to assess areas that many be more or less suitable for development. Given that many of the impacts to marine mammals associated with wind turbines occur during specific activities such as pile driving, seasonal maps should be consulted to minimize impacts by either avoiding certain seasons or undertaking other appropriate mitigation measures during high use seasons.
> Species-specific maps are provided to display the distribution of a species that occupies the area seasonally, or to identify the distribution of an ESA-listed species. Both large cetaceans and small cetaceans are included in the analysis. Among the large cetaceans, fin whales are the most prevalent species in the study area. Fin whales comprise the largest standing stock size of all cetaceans in all seasons in many areas of the United States EEZ from Cape Hatteras to Nova Scotia, and are one of the most ecologically significant cetaceans due to the significant food requirements (Waring et al., 2010). This ESA-listed endangered large whale was chosen for mapping due to the high abundance in the study area, with 415 sightings of 1370 individuals. Over half of the sightings occurred in summer. As depicted on Map 5, although fin whales have been observed close to shore, they are more prominent beyond the 35-meter depth contour, where 93% of the sightings are beyond 35 meters. Given a near-shore bias that comes from observational data, if anything, one would expect that the ratio of fin whales on either side of the 35-meter depth contour is even greater than the depicted. In addition to fin whales, other large cetaceans displayed include sperm whales and unidentified large whales. Sperm whales were sighted exclusively beyond the 35-meter contour in the study area, and 11% of unidentified whales were inshore if this contour. Please refer to Maps 5, 6, 7.
> Small cetaceans also are common in the study area. The most numerous are the bottlenose dolphins in Delaware’s coastal waters. Over the past decade, NOAA has made the distinction between a coastal and an offshore morphotype and NOAA manages them as separate stocks. The offshore stock generally lives in waters >50 m deep, although they have been seen in waters as shallow as 13 m deep, 7 km from shore. The coastal morphotype is generally seen in water <25 m deep. Furthermore, the coastal morphotype is delineated into northern and southern migratory stocks, with the northern migratory stock summer migration being the only stock off Delaware. Coastal bottlenose dolphins have year-round status in the mid-Atlantic (Waring et al., 2010). As can be seen, bottlenose dolphins have been sighted both very close to shore as well as beyond the 100-meter contour. Eighteen percent of bottlenose dolphins sighted were within the 35-meter contour, 82% beyond. In addition to bottlenose dolphins, other small cetaceans relatively common in the study area include Risso’s dolphins (100% beyond the 35-meter contour), pilot whales (100% beyond the 35-meter contour), and common dolphins (less than 1% inshore of the 35-meter contour). Please refer to Maps 8, 9, 10, and 11.

> It is important to consider the migratory timing and corridor of marine mammals, which sheds lights on the seasonal abundance of species. Consider for example, North Atlantic right whales, one of the most critically endangered species in North America, with a population size of approximately 360 individuals (Waring et al., 2009). Mortality and injury due to vessel strike and entanglement with commercial fishing gear is a leading cause of injury and mortality of these great whales, which is an ongoing threat as human use of the marine environment intensifies (Laist et al., 2001). North Atlantic right whales are well known to migrate between feeding grounds in the Gulf of Maine and calving grounds off the Florida coast. The mid-Atlantic region therefore comprises an important segment of the migratory corridor, with sightings in late fall/winter travelling south, and early spring moving north (Knowlton et al., 2002). The migration patterns of North Atlantic right whales can be narrowed to a finer time scale. Analysis of survey data can provide estimates of the temporal and spatial scale of migration.
> A relevant study was completed by Firestone et al. (2008) to determine the departure date of whales leaving the winter calving grounds to the summer feeding grounds using statistical methods. After analyzing data between the years of 1762 to 2004, results indicate that the migration departure date could be determined within a 30-day window, departing early to mid-March (Firestone et al., 2008). Although the migration route can be predicted, North Atlantic right whales have been spotted throughout the mid-Atlantic year-round. In a recent two-year study off the New Jersey coast, right whale sightings occurred in each season except summer, and acoustic recordings indicated the presence of right whales in all seasons (Geo-Marine, Inc., 2010). Furthermore, the majority of North Atlantic right whale survey and opportunistic detections in the mid-Atlantic (94%) are within 30 nm of shore, with over half of detections (63%) are within 10 nm from shore (Knowlton et al., 2002). Although there could be a near shore effort bias to these sightings, whales that were tagged and tracked show a similar pattern, although less pronounced, with the majority of tagged individuals within 25 nm from shore (Knowlton et al., 2002).
> With the ability to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of migration, offshore wind siting and construction plans can be optimized to adjust for these considerations. In the example of the North Atlantic right whale, it would be wise for regulatory authorities to require mitigation measures of offshore wind developers particularly during late fall through spring to minimize impacts during migration. Charts indicating the percentages of species sightings by season are represented in Figure 1. Furthermore, both the fin whale and bottlenose dolphin are represented by season in Maps 12-19. Seasons were delineated as spring (March – May), summer (June – August), fall (September – November), and winter (December – February. Management challenges are evident by because, unlike the North Atlantic right whale, the plurality of both fin whales and bottlenose dolphins were sighted in the summer months.
