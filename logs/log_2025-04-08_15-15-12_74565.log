> 15 Carbon Pricing and Emissions Markets in Practice
> Key Messages
> Both tax and trading can be used to create an explicit price for carbon; and regulation can
> create an implicit price.
> For all these instruments, credibility, flexibility and predictability are vital to effective
> policy design.
> A lack of credible policy may undermine the effectiveness of carbon pricing, as well as
> creating uncertainties for firms considering large, long-term investments.
> To establish the credibility of carbon pricing globally will take time. During the transition
> period, governments should consider how to deal with investments in long-lived assets which
> risk locking economies into a high-carbon trajectory.
> To reap the benefits of emissions trading, deep and liquid markets and well designed
> rules are important. Broadening the scope of schemes will tend to lower costs and reduce
> volatility. Increasing the use of auctioning is likely to have benefits for efficiency, distribution
> and potentially the public finances.
> Decisions made now on the third phase of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme pose an
> opportunity for the scheme to influence, and be the nucleus of, future global carbon markets.
> The establishment of common incentives across different sectors is important for
> efficiency. The overall structure of incentives, however, will reflect other market failures and
> complexities within the sectors concerned, as well as the climate change externality.
> The characteristics of different sectors will influence the design and choice of policy
> tool. Transaction costs of a trading scheme, for instance, will tend to be higher in sectors
> where there are many emission sources. The existing framework of national policies in these
> sectors will be an important influence on policy choice.
> 15.1 Introduction
> This chapter considers how markets for emission reductions can be built on the principles
> considered in Chapter 14. The application of these principles requires careful analysis of the
> context of specific economies and institutional structures– at the national, international,
> regional or sectoral levels.
> Section 15.2 discusses the importance of designing policies in a way which creates
> confidence in the future existence of a robust carbon price, so that businesses and individuals
> can plan their investment decisions accordingly. The current use of emissions trading
> schemes is discussed in Section 15.3, and 15.4 focuses particularly on the issues around
> creating a credible carbon price in emissions trading schemes.
> The choice and design of such policy instruments also depends on the specific sectoral
> context. Policies which work for one sector may be inappropriate for another, although a
> common price is still needed across sectors for efficiency in the costs of mitigation. The
> relationship between climate change policy and other objectives, such as energy security and
> local air pollution, is also important. These issues are discussed in 15.5.
> Carbon pricing is only one part of a strategy to tackle climate change. It must be
> complemented by measures to support the development of technologies, and to remove the
> barriers to behavioural change, particularly around take-up of energy efficiency. These two
> elements are discussed in Chapters 16 and 17.

> 15.2 Carbon pricing and investment decisions
> Investors need a predictable carbon policy
> Businesses always have to take uncertainties into account when making investment
> decisions. Factors such as the future oil price, changes in consumer demand, and even the
> weather can affect the future profitability of an investment. Business decision-makers make
> judgements on how these factors are likely to evolve over time.
> But unlike many other uncertainties that firms face, climate change policy is created solely by
> governments. To be successful, a carbon pricing policy must therefore be based on a
> framework that enables investors to have confidence that carbon policy will be maintained
> over sequential periods into the future.
> Serious doubt over the future viability of a policy, or its stringency, risks imposing costs
> without having a significant impact on behaviour, so increasing the cost of mitigation.
> Creating an expectation that a policy is very likely to be sustained over a long period is critical
> to its effectiveness.
> Credibility, flexibility and predictability are key to effective policy
> Three essential elements for an effective policy framework are credibility (belief that the policy
> will endure, and be enforced); flexibility (the ability to change the policy in response to new
> information and changing circumstances); and predictability (setting out the circumstances
> and procedures under which the policy will change). These apply to any type of policy,
> including the technology and regulatory measures set out in the following chapters, but are
> particularly pertinent to carbon pricing.
> A key issue for credibility is whether the policy commands support from a range of interest
> groups. Public opinion is particularly important: sustained pressure from the public for action
> on climate change gives politicians the confidence to take measures which they might
> otherwise deem too risky or unpopular. It must also make sense within an international
> context: if there are good prospects for a robust international framework, this will greatly
> enhance the credibility of national goals for emissions reductions.
> As Chapter 14 has discussed, the flexibility to adjust policy in the short term is an important
> principle for efficient pricing under conditions of uncertainty. Policy must be robust to
> changing circumstances and changing knowledge. If policy is seen to be excessively rigid, its
> credibility may suffer, as people perceive a risk that it will be dropped altogether if
> circumstances change.
> Building in predictable and transparent revision rules from the start is the best way to maintain
> confidence in the policy, whilst also allowing flexibility in its application.
> Issues of credibility are particularly important for investments in long-lived capital
> stock
> Taking a long-term view on the carbon price is particularly important for businesses investing
> in long-lived assets1. Assets such as power stations, industrial plant and buildings last for
> many decades, and businesses making investment decisions on these assets often have
> longer time horizons than many governments.
> If businesses believe that carbon prices will rise in the long run to match the damage costs of
> emissions over time, this should lead them to invest in low-carbon rather than high-carbon
> assets. But in the transitional period, where the credibility of carbon pricing is being

> established worldwide, there is a risk that future carbon prices are not properly factored into
> business decision-making, and investments may be made in long-lived, high-carbon assets.
> This could lock economies into a high-carbon trajectory, making future mitigation efforts more
> expensive. Governments should take careful account of this: as well as providing as much
> clarity as possible about future carbon pricing policies, they should also consider whether any

> .
> Uncertainty about the long-term future framework for carbon pricing is also a reason why
> additional measures to encourage the development of low-carbon technologies are important.
> This is discussed in Chapter 16.
> Policy uncertainty not only undermines climate change policy – it can also undermine
> security of supply, by creating an incentive to delay investment decisions.
> Uncertainty about the future existence or overall direction of policy, this creates difficulties for
> how businesses respond. There is a risk that businesses will adopt a ‘wait and see’ attitude,
> delaying their investment decisions until the policy direction becomes clearer.
> Blyth and Yang (2006) look at the incentives for a company faced with a decision on whether
> to invest in high-carbon or low-carbon infrastructure. If a decision is expected at some point in
> the future about whether or not a new climate change policy will be introduced, a company
> which makes its investment decision now, risks a loss later if it makes the wrong call on
> policy. If it waits until the policy is agreed, it can make a more informed choice. Given this

> In the energy sector, such delays in investment could create serious problems for a country’s
> security of supply. Modelling work by Blyth and Yang (2006) indicates that an increase in the
> period of relative carbon price stability from 5 to 10 years (which could equate to increasing
> the length of an allocation period in a trading scheme) could reduce the size of the investment
> thresholds arising from uncertainty by a factor of 2 or more4

> Credibility may also vary between policy instruments
> Credibility may vary between different types of policy instrument. For instance, taxation
> provides governments with a revenue stream, and there tends to be an expectation that it will
> not be in a government’s interests to abolish it. Regulation may be more effective in countries

> administrative problems with raising taxes or with tax collection. Specific national

> quality of legal infrastructures and enforcement, play a key role in determining what credible

> Another important element is the level at which policy takes place. Regulation or trading

> 15.3 Experience in emissions trading

> countries, while delivering the least-cost reductions. In many instances, introducing trading
> schemes is also an easier mechanism through which to achieve a common carbon price
> across countries than attempts to harmonise taxes. As such, trading schemes can be used to
> introduce carbon pricing, without risking carbon leakage and competitiveness implications
> between participating countries. Emissions trading is therefore a very powerful tool in the
> framework for addressing climate change at an international level.
> Emissions trading is not new to environmental policy. Trading in emissions has been used to
> reduce sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions that cause acid rain in the US since
> 19955. The experience of this scheme increased interest in the potential use of emissions
> trading to tackle climate change – particularly due to its potential cost effectiveness compared
> to the use of regulation. Burtaw (1996) estimated that emissions trading under the US Acid
> Rain Program saved 50% of the costs compared to command and control.
> The use of carbon trading schemes is expanding
> During the 1990s, as experience of emissions trading for air pollution grew in the US, the EU
> began to consider the potential of using trading to meeting its Kyoto target emission reduction
> obligations. The European Commission presented a ‘Green Paper’ in 2000 that proposed the
> use of emissions trading. It showed that a comprehensive trading scheme could reduce
> compliance costs of meeting Kyoto by a third, compared to a scenario with no trading
> instrument6
> .
> The EU has since gone on to implement a trading scheme in major energy intensive and
> energy generation sectors, and in so doing, established the world’s largest greenhouse gas
> emissions market. Launched in January 2005, the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS)
> is still in its infancy. The scheme will enter a second, longer phase in 2008, with a major

> Box 15.2 Price caps and floors in emission trading schemes
> As explained in Hepburn et al (2006), a hybrid instrument can in principle be tailored to

> However, people would still have to believe that the caps and floors themselves will not be
> changed. There are also risks that the imposition of a cap alone would damage incentives for

> lowering potential returns to low carbon technology26

> Importantly, the use of different price caps and floors in different schemes would compromise

> public finance implications of switching to trading with free allocations; voluntary standards
> might be very effective in countries with a strong tradition of co-operation between
> government and business, but much less so in countries with a different culture.
> As in other sectors, climate change is not the only market failure in the transport sector and
> there are important interactions with other policy goals. Congestion, for instance, imposes
> external costs on other motorists by increasing their journey time. Congestion pricing and
> carbon pricing are very similar approaches from an economic point of view - they both price
> for an externality. Congestion charging could have a positive or negative impact on carbon
> emissions from transport, depending on how the instrument is designed and level at which the
> charge is set.
> Aviation
> Aviation faces some difficult challenges. Whilst there is potential for incremental
> improvements in efficiency to continue, more radical options for emissions cuts are very
> limited. The international nature of aviation also makes the choice of carbon pricing
> instrument complex. Internationally coordinated taxes are difficult to implement, since it is
> contrary to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) rules to levy fuel tax on fuel
> carried on international services53. The majority of the many bilateral air service agreements
> that regulate international air services also forbid taxation of fuel taken on board. Partly for
> this reason, levels of taxation in the aviation sector globally are currently low relative to road
> transport fuel taxes. This contributes to congestion and capacity limits at airports – a form of
> rationing, which is an inefficient way of regulating demand.
> While either tax or trading would, in principle, be effective ways to price emissions from this
> sector, the choice of tax, trading or other instruments is likely to be driven as much by political
> viability as by the economics. Chapter 22 will discuss further the issues of international co-
> ordination of policy in this area (as well as in shipping, which faces similar issues). A lack of
> international co-ordination could lead to serious carbon leakage issues, as aircraft would have
> incentives to fuel up in countries without a carbon price in place.
> The level of the carbon price faced by aviation should reflect the full contribution of emissions
> from aviation to climate change. As outlined in Box 15.6, the impact of aviation is two to four
> times higher than the impact of the CO2 emissions alone. This should be taken into account,
> either through the design of a tax or trading scheme, through both in tandem, or by using
> additional complementary measures.
> 53 Article 24 of Chicago Convention exempts fuel for international services from fuel duty. See ICAO (2006).

> PART IV: Policy Responses for Mitigation
> Box 15.6 The impact of aviation on climate change
> Aviation CO2 emissions currently account for 0.7 Gt CO2
> 54 (1.6% of global GHG emissions).
> However the impact of aviation on climate change is greater than these figures suggest
> because of other gases released by aircraft and their effects at high altitude. For example,
> water vapour emitted at high altitude often triggers the formation of condensation trails, which
> tend to warm the earth’s surface. There is also a highly uncertain global warming effect from
> cirrus clouds (clouds of ice crystals) that can be created by aircraft.
> In 2050 under ‘business as usual’ projections, CO2 emissions from aviation would represent
> 2.5% of global GHG emissions55. However taking into account the non-CO2 effects of
> aviation would mean that it would account for around 5% of the total warming effect (radiative
> forcing) in 205056
> .
> The uncertainties over the overall impact of aviation on climate change mean that there is
> currently no internationally recognised method of converting CO2 emissions into the full CO2
> equivalent quantity.
> Agriculture and land use
> Agricultural emissions come from a large number of small emitters (farms), over three
> quarters of which are in developing and transition economies. Emissions from agriculture
> depend on the specific farming practices employed and the local environment conditions.
> Since the sources tend to be distributed, there would be high transaction costs associated
> with actual measurement of GHG at the point of emission.
> An alternative approach in this sector would be to focus on pricing GHG emission ‘proxies’.
> For example, excessive use of fertiliser or high nutrient livestock feeds is associated with high
> emissions, but by appropriate pricing, emissions can be reduced. However in practice, in
> many developing countries fertiliser is actually subsidised, largely to support the incomes of
> farmers. In many countries it is a somewhat regressive subsidy, as it is the richer farmers or
> agribusinesses who gain most.
> Difficulties associated with measuring emissions are also the reason why it is difficult to
> incorporate GHG emissions from agriculture into a trading scheme. However there are
> examples of projects that have overcome these problems and enabled farmers adopting
> sustainable agriculture practices to sell their emission savings on to others via voluntary
> schemes; this issue is discussed further in Chapter 25.
> Inadequate water pricing can intensify the problems of weak fertiliser pricing, since water and
> fertiliser are complementary inputs – additional fertiliser works much better with stronger
> irrigation.
> Many countries have adopted regulation of agricultural practices. For example, regulations for
> the use of water in growing rice, the quantity and type of fertiliser used in crop production, or
> the treatment of manure. Regulations are often location specific, because local conditions
> influence best practice. However, in developing countries, enforcement of regulations can be
> difficult because they may not have the institutional structures or resources to allocate to this
> task. Better pricing of inputs is generally a preferable route: income support to poor farmers or
> agricultural workers can be organised in much better ways than subsidised inputs.
> 54 WRI (2005).
> 55 Aviation BAU CO2 emissions in 2050 estimated at 2.3 GtCO2, from WBCSD (2004). Total GHG emissions in 2050
> estimated at 84 GtCO2e (for discussion of how calculated, see Chapter 7). 56 IPCC (1999). This assumes that the warming effect (radiative forcing) of aviation is 2 to 4 times greater than the
> effect of the CO2 emissions alone. This could be an overestimate because recent research by Sausen et al (2005)
> suggests the warming ratio is closer to 2. It could be an underestimate because both estimates exclude the highly
> uncertain possible warming effects of cirrus clouds.

> There are complex challenges involved with the inclusion of deforestation, the major cause of
> land use emissions, in carbon trading schemes. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 25.
> 15.6 Conclusions
> Chapter 14 discussed how, at the global level, policymakers need both a shared
> understanding of a long-run stabilisation goal, and the flexibility to revise short-run policies
> over time.
> At the national – or regional level – policy makers will want to achieve these goals in a way
> that builds on existing policies, and creates confidence in the future existence of a carbon
> price. In particular, they will want to assess how carbon pricing (through either taxation,
> tradable quotas or regulation) will interact with existing market structures, and existing policies
> (for instance, to encourage the development of renewable energy or petrol taxes).
> Governments will want to tailor a package of measures that suits their specific circumstances.
> Some may choose to focus on regional trading initiatives, others on taxation and others may
> make greater use of regulation. The key goal of policy should be to establish common
> incentives across different sectors, using the most appropriate mechanism for a particular
> sector. With market failures elsewhere, other objectives, and the costs of adjustment
> associated with long-lived capital, it will be important to look both the simple price or tax to
> see what incentives in particular sectors really are.
> Carbon pricing is only one element of a policy approach to climate change. The following two
> chapters discuss the role of technology policy, and policies to influence attitudes and
> behaviours, particularly in regard to energy efficiency. All three elements are important to
> achieve lowest cost emissions reductions.

> 
> 6. **Why is carbon pricing particularly important for investments in long-lived capital stock, such as power plants?**
>    - A) They have short investment recovery periods
>    - B) Future carbon prices will likely increase, affecting profitability
>    - C) Their rapid depreciation means they will soon be replaced
>    - D) They are immune to policy changes, unlike other sectors
> 
> 7. **How does the Stern Review suggest emissions trading can facilitate international carbon pricing efficiently?**
>    - A) By ensuring high transaction costs in all member countries
>    - B) Through establishing deep, liquid, and efficient global markets
>    - C) By limiting the number of gas types included in the market
