**user**:
> I need to reduce the space taken by a subversion repository, and I want to remove a directory completely to do this. I can't just delete the file in SVN, since it will still take up space in the history. How can I do it?
**assistant**:
> To reduce the space taken by a Subversion (SVN) repository and remove a directory completely, you can use the `svnadmin` command with the `svndumpfilter` and `svnadmin load` options. Here's a step-by-step guide:
> 
> 1. Create a dump file of the SVN repository using the `svnadmin dump` command. For example:
>    ```shell
>    svnadmin dump /path/to/repository > repository.dmp
>    ```
> 
> 2. Use the `svndumpfilter` command to filter out the directory you want to remove from the dump file. Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual directory path. For example:
>    ```shell
>    svndumpfilter exclude /path/to/directory < repository.dmp > filtered.dmp
>    ```
> 
> 3. Create a new SVN repository using the `svnadmin create` command. For example:
>    ```shell
>    svnadmin create /path/to/newrepository
>    ```
> 
> 4. Load the filtered dump file into the new repository using the `svnadmin load` command. For example:
>    ```shell
>    svnadmin load /path/to/newrepository < filtered.dmp
>    ```
> 
> 5. Verify the contents of the new repository to ensure the directory has been removed. You can use the `svn ls` command to list the repository contents. For example:
>    ```shell
>    svn ls file:///path/to/newrepository
>    ```
> 
> 6. If everything looks good, you can replace the original repository with the new one. Make sure to backup the original repository before doing this step. For example:
>    ```shell
>    mv /path/to/repository /path/to/repository_backup
>    mv /path/to/newrepository /path/to/repository
>    ```
> 
> By following these steps, you can remove the directory from the SVN repository and reclaim space by excluding it from the repository's history. However, please note that this process permanently removes the directory and all related history from the repository, so make sure to have a backup before proceeding.
**user**:
> I have a few directories I would like to remove, can I do that with svndumpfilter?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can remove multiple directories using `svndumpfilter` by specifying multiple `exclude` commands. Here's an example of how you can remove multiple directories from a Subversion (SVN) repository dump file:
> 
> 1. Create a dump file of the SVN repository using the `svnadmin dump` command. For example:
>    ```shell
>    svnadmin dump /path/to/repository > repository.dmp
>    ```
> 
> 2. Use the `svndumpfilter` command to filter out the directories you want to remove from the dump file. Specify multiple `exclude` commands for each directory you want to remove. For example:
>    ```shell
>    svndumpfilter exclude /path/to/directory1 --drop-empty-revs < repository.dmp > filtered.dmp
>    svndumpfilter exclude /path/to/directory2 --drop-empty-revs < filtered.dmp > filtered2.dmp
>    ```
> 
>    Note the use of the `--drop-empty-revs` option. This ensures that any empty revisions resulting from the removal of the directories are also excluded from the filtered dump file. You can repeat the `exclude` command for each additional directory you want to remove.
> 
> 3. Follow the remaining steps from my previous response to create a new SVN repository, load the filtered dump file, and verify the contents.
> 
> By specifying multiple `exclude` commands with the desired directory paths, you can remove multiple directories from the SVN repository dump file. Make sure to modify the directory paths (`/path/to/directory1`, `/path/to/directory2`, etc.) as per your specific case.
> 
> Remember to have a backup of your original repository before performing these operations.
