> How do I aggregate a raster stack (R) that is 3-hourly to daily?

> I'm delighted to assist you with your R programming question. You can aggregate a raster stack from 3-hourly to daily using a function like `mean` or `sum`, with the appropriate `collapse` function from the `raster` package in R. Here's a general walkthrough of how to achieve this:
> 
> 1. [Load the necessary library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/raster.pdf).
> ```r
> library(raster)
> ```
> 2. [Load your RasterStack](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/3.5-15/topics/stack). Next, load your raster stack. I'll assume you've already done this and that your RasterStack is stored as `rst`.
> 
> 3. [Split the RasterStack](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/3.5-15/topics/brick). The first step is to identify which rasters belong to which day. We'll achieve this by creating a list of rasters based on their time-stamps. The timestamps are assumed to be in the names of the rasters, in the format "YearMonthDay_Hour". For example, "20230817_21" stands for "2023 August 17th, 21:00 hrs". Alternatively, if you have a separate time series that aligns with the rasters, that can also be used.
> ```r
> # Assuming raster names have format YearMonthDay_Hour
> raster_dates = gsub("(_).*", "", names(rst))  # Remove everything from "_" 
> raster_days = unique(raster_dates)  # Unique dates are the separate days
> splits = lapply(raster_days, function(x) which(raster_dates == x))  # Identify which rasters belong to each day
> ```
> 4. [Aggregate the rasters](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/2.6-7/topics/calc). Now, we split the rasters based on the list we generated, apply our function (let's say mean), and then stack them back together. Note that if `mean` is not appropriate (for example, if your rasters are rainfall, you might want to use `sum`), you need to change that.
> ```r
> daily_rst = lapply(splits, function(indices) calc(rst[[indices]], mean))  # Apply the function to each split 
> daily_rst = stack(daily_rst)  # Combine the new daily rasters into a RasterStack again
> ```
> 
> The above script will give you a new `RasterStack`, where the 3-hourly rasters have been aggregated into daily rasters.
