> Robert Peck was a rector excommunicated for his puritan beliefs, and later I think that about half of his church moved with him out to America. What would someone have noticed that was different about Mr. Peck's church that would drive such distinctiveness and loyalty?
**assistant**:
> Robert Peck's situation sounds quite fascinating, reflecting the broader dynamics and tensions of the Puritan movement. As a rector excommunicated for his Puritan beliefs, several distinctive aspects of his church might have driven both its distinctiveness and the loyalty of its congregation:
> 
> 1. **Simplicity and Directness in Worship**: Puritan services tended to eschew the elaborate ceremonies and hierarchical structure of the Anglican Church, focusing instead on simplicity and directness in worship. This could have created a more personal and intense spiritual experience, resonating deeply with congregants seeking a purer form of worship.
> 
> 2. **Emphasis on Scripture**: Puritans placed a high emphasis on the Bible, encouraging congregants to read and interpret scripture personally. This focus might have attracted members who valued direct engagement with texts and wanted to enhance their religious understanding.
> 
> 3. **Community and Accountability**: Puritan communities were often tightly-knit with strong social bonds and mutual accountability in moral and religious matters. Such a community dynamic would engender deep loyalty among its members, who felt supported and compelled to remain with their congregation.
> 
> 4. **Opposition to Established Practices**: Peck's excommunication suggests his willingness to challenge established practices and authorities. This opposition may have inspired congregants dissatisfied with ecclesiastical authorities, aligning with their desire for church reforms.
> 
> 5. **Charismatic Leadership**: As a figure willing to lead his flock across the ocean to America, Peck likely possessed a strong, charismatic leadership quality. Such leadership might have further galvanized his congregationâ€™s loyalty and willingness to undertake significant risks for their beliefs.
> 
> 6. **Promise of Religious Freedom**: The prospect of practicing their faith freely in America, without persecution, would have been a powerful motivator, offering a stark contrast to their experiences under an unsupportive ecclesiastical regime in England.
> 
> Together, these characteristics could have made Peck's church notably distinct and fostered deep loyalty among its members, compelling many to undertake the daunting journey to America for a new life rooted in their shared religious convictions.
