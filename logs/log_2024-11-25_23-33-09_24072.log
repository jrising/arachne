>  - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
>  - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

>  - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &

> Dear Dr.James A. Rising,

> I hope you are doing well.

> I’m Urmila Selvakumar, a Sri Lankan fisheries researcher who is exploring a post-graduate opportunity in fisheries and climate change studies.
>  
> I earned my undergraduate degree in 2022 with a second-class upper degree (3.44 GPA) from the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences and Technology, University of Ruhuna, majoring in Fisheries Science. I learned the fundamentals of fisheries science including population dynamics, fisheries oceanography, remote sensing, data analysis, stock assessment, and spatial distribution of marine species. My lifelong connection with the fisheries sector, as I was born and raised in a coastal village in northern Sri Lanka, and the university knowledge inspired me to dedicate myself to the fisheries research field. After graduation, I started working as a research assistant at Pelagikos, a private business entity in Sri Lanka, which led me to rub shoulders with the fisheries community to collect time series fish catch data, and gain insight into climate change impacts on the Sri Lankan fisheries sector.  
> 
> I’m very aware of the importance of learning cutting-edge data science techniques critical to solving the climate change-fisheries conflicts.  Currently, I’ve been working on a project to determine climate change (ocean warming, sea level rise, and cyclone) and socioeconomic impacts on fisheries in northern coastal Sri Lanka, a collaborative effort with fisheries and climate data scientists from Sri Lanka and the USA. Besides, I’ve been exploring potential postgraduate opportunities to broaden my knowledge in fisheries ecology and climate change. I explored your website and the state-of-the-art research you’ve been conducting over the past years excited me to write to you to inquire about a potential postgraduate opportunity in the future.  
> I’m confident that I will be a perfect match for your research group, and I will benefit a lot from working with you in the future. So, I would like to request your kind consideration to discuss any postgraduate opportunities under your supervision. I have attached my CV for your review.
>  
> Thank you very much for your kind consideration.

**assistant**:
> Urmila's email suggests she is interested in postgraduate opportunities related to fisheries and climate change, particularly in the context of her background in fisheries science. She has practical experience in the field and expresses interest in data science techniques for addressing climate change impacts on fisheries. Urmila hasn't specified a particular program of interest, nor has she indicated she's local to the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area or has connections to mentioned institutions. She seems well-versed in quantitative and interdisciplinary modeling which aligns with your research interests, and she appears to be a strong candidate for Ph.D. programs, particularly in the context of your work on climate change risks.

> Here's a suggested response:

> ---
> 
> Dear Urmila,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in our research on climate change and fisheries systems. Your background and experiences are quite impressive, and I appreciate your dedication to addressing climate challenges within the fisheries sector.
> 
> Given your research interests, we offer several graduate programs that might align with your goals:
> - The *Ph.D. in Marine Policy* is suitable for students with strong qualitative backgrounds, though it can accommodate some quantitative focus through research.
> - Our *Masters in Environmental Science & Management* includes a marine track that might well suit your interest in integrating marine studies with climate change.
> - For candidates with a strong quantitative inclination, which you seem to have, the *Ph.D. in Environmental Economics* might be a particularly good fit, given its focus on interdisciplinary quantitative modeling of socio-environmental systems.
> 
> Regardless of which program you might pursue, I recommend applying by December 1 for full consideration, as funding for Ph.D. programs is limited. For all master’s programs, you should be prepared to self-fund.
> 
> To help identify the best program for you, please fill out our form here:
> https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7
> 
> If you are particularly interested in quantitative modeling within my research group, I encourage you to mention this in your statement of purpose. This will ensure your application is aligned with our research goals.
