**assistant**:
> Yes, you can create a web page that responds to forward and backward audio controls in your car, but it requires some specific setup and support from the car's infotainment system. Modern cars with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay may allow such integration through custom apps or web applications that interface with their APIs.
> 
> Here’s a rough outline of the steps you might take:
> 
> 1. **Check Compatibility:** Make sure your car's infotainment system supports app development or customization. This is key to integrating any features like audio controls.
> 
> 2. **Audio Control Interface:** Identify the API or SDK that allows you to interact with the car's infotainment system. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay have specific guidelines and APIs for developing apps.
> 
> 3. **Web App Development:** Develop a web app using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Implement event listeners to respond to audio control input.
> 
> 4. **Integration:** Use the car's API to send information from the car controls to your web app. This might require developing a native or hybrid app that can bridge your web app with the car’s controls.
> 
> 5. **Testing and Deployment:** Rigorously test in a controlled environment and follow any specific deployment or approval processes required by the car manufacturer.
> 
> 6. **Compliance and Safety:** Ensure that the app meets all legal and safety requirements, particularly those related to driver distractions.
> 
> This can be a complex task, depending on the car's compatibility and the specific interaction you want. If you need more detailed guidance on any steps, let me know!
**user**:
> is there something standard within the mdn it seems like it works with non-custom apps
**assistant**:
> Yes, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides documentation on the Web Audio API, but it doesn't directly cover standard methods for interacting with car audio controls since those controls depend largely on the car manufacturer’s implementation. 
> 
> However, if a standard web technology works with non-custom apps, it’s likely through a combination of web standards like:
> 
> 1. **Media Session API:** This allows you to control media playback and handle notifications for media events. It can respond to media key events like play, pause, next, and previous.
> 
> 2. **Web Audio API:** This helps manage audio playback but won't directly control hardware buttons.
> 
> To use the Media Session API, you would implement event listeners for media controls in your JavaScript code, enabling the web page to respond when the user presses audio control buttons. Here's an example snippet:
> 
> ```javascript
> if ('mediaSession' in navigator) {
>   navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('play', function() {
>     // Code to play media
>   });
>   navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('pause', function() {
>     // Code to pause media
>   });
>   navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('previoustrack', function() {
>     // Code to play previous track
>   });
>   navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('nexttrack', function() {
>     // Code to play next track
>   });
> }
> ```
> 
> Check the compatibility of the Media Session API in the specific context of your car's system, as various manufacturers might have different implementations or may not support it at all. If you want help with anything specific, just let me know!
