>  - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for

> Dear Professor James Rising,
> 
> It is with great pleasure to write you this email. I am Job Nagarmi Sowah, and I hold a Bachelor of Social Science degree in Economics from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana-West Africa, dating from September 2016 to August 2020. I graduated with a GPA of 3.4 on a 4.0 scale. I am also in my final year of a master's in Petroleum and Energy Studies at the same university, and I hope to finish this November.
> 
> I would like to express my strong interest in joining you in the research at the School of Marine Science and Policy for an MS/Ph.D. in Environmental Economics.
> 
> While researching potential supervisors for my studies, I was deeply impressed by your research area focusing on the impacts of climate change bringing together empirical estimates and integrated assessment models; Modeling of social-environmental systems focusing on complex systems, food and fisheries, and resource management.
> 
>   I came across one of your publications on "The social cost of carbon dioxide under climate-economy feedbacks and temperature variability"  and I was immediately intrigued. Some of the questions that permeated my mind while I went through the work were:
> 
> 
> How can we make models better at estimating the cost of releasing CO2 by considering climate, economic, and extreme events?
> What are the consequences of higher CO2 costs, particularly for countries in the Global South, and how can this help us plan for climate change?
> Your extensive experience in this field is an asset I wish to learn from to find answers to these questions. I believe that your research aligns with my research interests, and am confident that working under your guidance will provide me with the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue a career in environmental economics.
> 
> I have attached my resume and transcripts for your review, and I would be honored to discuss my qualifications and research interests further with you. I believe that your research offers a unique opportunity for me to realize my research goals and make a meaningful contribution to the field of environmental studies
> 
> 
> 
> Thank you immensely for your time and consideration. I eagerly await your response and the prospect of working together.

> Subject: Your Interest in MS/Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the School of Marine Science & Policy
> 
> Dear Job Nagarmi Sowah,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out to me expressing your interest in joining the research at the School of Marine Science and Policy for an MS/Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. I appreciate your kind words and enthusiasm for my research areas, particularly the impacts of climate change, integrated assessment models, and modeling of social-environmental systems.
> 
> Based on your background and research interests, I believe that the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program would be the ideal fit for you. This program focuses on equipping students with the necessary skills to address complex environmental and economic challenges, like estimating the social cost of carbon dioxide emissions, considering climate-economic feedbacks, and analyzing the implications for countries, especially those in the Global South.
> 
> However, I must mention that funding for the Ph.D. program is limited, and it is important to apply by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funds. Given your strong qualifications and alignment with my research, I encourage you to mention our shared research interests in your statement of purpose, as it may positively influence the admission decision.
> 
> I appreciate you attaching your resume and transcripts for review. Your commitment to academic excellence is evident, and I look forward to discussing your qualifications and research interests further. If you have any specific questions or would like to schedule a conversation, please let me know.
> 
> Thank you once again for your interest and the potential opportunity to work together. I will carefully review your materials and get back to you soon.
