> I hope this email finds you well. My name is Anqi Wang, and I am writing to express my strong interest in applying to the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware this fall. I hope to join your research group as a graduate student.

> I will complete my bachelor’s degree in Economics and Mathematics (double major) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in June 2025. Since July 2024, I have been working as a research assistant for Prof. Sisi Meng at the University of Notre Dame. In this role, I have co-authored a paper (currently undergoing final revisions) on the empirical study of environmental justice implications of hydraulic fracking wells in Texas, with spatial and temporal sociodemographic data. This experience has further fueled my interest in applying economic principles and methods to environmental issues, particularly through empirical and data-driven research. Additionally, I am collaborating with Prof. Meng to develop methods for estimating GDP loss during hurricanes (Harvey and Beryl) using nighttime light and survey data, while comparing and validating the results.

> Your work on the economic impacts of climate change and risk assessment aligns closely with my research interests, and the research topics you focus on, like water systems, are fields I would like to explore further. My background in data collection and analysis, especially using econometric techniques and software like Stata, along with my experience working with spatial and temporal data, has prepared me to contribute to similar projects. Additionally, my strong theoretical foundation in mathematics, statistics, and economics, along with my proficiency in Python and Stata, enables me to effectively tackle diverse research topics and methodologies.
