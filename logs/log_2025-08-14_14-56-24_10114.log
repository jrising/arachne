> How do I do a hierarchical regression in R? My model is like this:
> Value ~ Outcome + ISO : Outcome + Year : Outcome
> So, each outcome should independently produce a set of results, but I want ISOs within an outcome to be normally distributed and the slopes on those values to be normally distributed too.
**assistant**:
> To perform a hierarchical (or multilevel) regression in R, you'll generally want to use the `lme4` package, which is suitable for linear mixed-effects models. You're looking to model various levels of interaction hierarchically, which `lmer()` can handle. Here's how you can structure your model based on your description:
> 
> First, ensure you have the `lme4` package installed and loaded:
> 
> ```r
> install.packages("lme4")
> library(lme4)
> ```
> 
> Then, you can set up your hierarchical regression model like this:
> 
> ```r
> # Fit the hierarchical model
> model <- lmer(Value ~ (1 | Outcome) + (1 + Outcome | ISO) + (1 + Outcome | Year), data = your_data)
> 
> # View the summary of the model
> summary(model)
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation:
> - `(1 | Outcome)`: This specifies that each `Outcome` has its own intercept that is allowed to vary.
> - `(1 + Outcome | ISO)`: This allows both intercepts and slopes for `Outcome` to vary by `ISO`.
> - `(1 + Outcome | Year)`: This allows both intercepts and slopes for `Outcome` to vary by `Year`.
> 
> This setup captures the hierarchical structure you described, where `ISO` and `Year` are nested within `Outcome`, and both the intercepts and slopes are allowed to vary.
> 
> Make sure your data frame `your_data` includes the columns `Value`, `Outcome`, `ISO`, and `Year`. Adjust the formula as needed based on your specific data structure. If you need further customization or have additional levels to consider, it might be necessary to expand the formula accordingly.
**user**:
> Can you explain how (1 + Outcome | ISO) is interpretted? Also, I want the slope (as a function of Year) to vary by Outcome, not by Year.
**assistant**:
> Certainly! Let's unpack the expression `(1 + Outcome | ISO)` and clarify the adjustments you want to make.
> 
> ### Interpretation of `(1 + Outcome | ISO)`
> - **`1`**: This indicates that there is a random intercept for each level of `ISO`. In simpler terms, each `ISO` group can have its own baseline level of the dependent variable (`Value`). This intercept captures the average `Value` for each `ISO`.
>   
> - **`Outcome`**: Here, adding `Outcome` means that each `ISO` can have its own slope for the `Outcome` variable. In practical terms, this means that the effect of `Outcome` on `Value` is allowed to differ across different `ISO` levels. 
> 
> So, `(1 + Outcome | ISO)` allows for:
> - Individualized intercepts for each `ISO`.
> - Unique slopes for the variable `Outcome` within each `ISO`, meaning the relationship between `Outcome` and `Value` can change depending on the `ISO`.
> 
> ### Adjusting for Your Requirement
> If you want the slope as a function of `Year` to vary specifically by `Outcome`, you would slightly modify your model to capture that. For instance, the revised model could look like this:
> 
> ```r
> # Fit the hierarchical model with varying slopes for Outcome by Year
> model <- lmer(Value ~ (1 | Outcome) + (1 | ISO) + (1 + Year | Outcome), data = your_data)
> 
> # View the summary of the model
> summary(model)
> ```
> 
> ### Breakdown of the Revised Model
> - **`(1 | Outcome)`**: Random intercept for `Outcome`, allowing each `Outcome` to have its own baseline value of `Value`.
> - **`(1 | ISO)`**: Random intercept for `ISO`, allowing each `ISO` to have its own baseline value.
> - **`(1 + Year | Outcome)`**: This term allows the slopes of `Year` to vary depending on `Outcome`. Each `Outcome` can now have a unique relationship with `Year`, meaning the impact of year on `Value` can differ for each type of `Outcome`.
> 
> ### Key Takeaway
> This structure effectively models the hierarchical nature of your data while allowing nuanced relationships between `Year` and `Value` that depend on the type of `Outcome`. Each layer of your model adds complexity to better fit the real-world relationships you're studying.
**user**:
> I think we're missing a thing I want in "(1 | Outcome) + (1 | ISO)". As I understand it, these are two random intercepts. But-- to say it another way-- I want each Outcome x ISO specific intercept to be drawn from a distribution Normal(alpha_Outcome, sd_Outcome).
**assistant**:
> To achieve the desired effect of having each `Outcome x ISO` pair with its own specific intercept drawn from a normal distribution, you can model it as a random effect with nesting. In the `lmer` model, this can be specified using a combination of random intercepts and their interactions.
> 
> However, in standard `lme4` syntax, random effects are handled separately, but you can achieve the effect you desire by structuring your model carefully. Here's how you can set it up:
> 
> ### Hierarchical Model with Outcome x ISO Random Effects
> 
> Instead of using separate random intercepts for `Outcome` and `ISO`, you can specify an interaction between `Outcome` and `ISO`. Here's the updated model:
> 
> ```r
> # Fit the hierarchical model with specific intercepts for Outcome and ISO
> model <- lmer(Value ~ (1 | Outcome:ISO) + (1 + Year | Outcome), data = your_data)
> 
> # View the summary of the model
> summary(model)
> ```
> 
> ### Breakdown of the Model
> - **`(1 | Outcome:ISO)`**: This term specifies a random intercept for each combination of `Outcome` and `ISO`. In this case, each specific intercept for a given `Outcome x ISO` pair is drawn from a normal distribution `Normal(alpha_Outcome, sd_Outcome)`.
>   
> - **`(1 + Year | Outcome)`**: This allows the slopes of `Year` to vary by `Outcome`, enabling you to model how the relationship between `Year` and `Value` changes across different `Outcomes`.
> 
> ### Key Points
> - The random effects specified with `Outcome:ISO` generate a unique intercept for each combination of `Outcome` and `ISO`, capturing the hierarchical structure you want.
> - Ensure that your data has both `Outcome` and `ISO` in the form of factors, so the model can appropriately account for the categorical nature of these variables.
> 
> ### Alternative Representation
> If you want to keep separate random intercepts for `Outcome` and `ISO`, you can also model them separately, but it won't give you the exact effect of combined `Outcome x ISO` intercepts. The interaction approach tends to be clearer for your specified need. 
> 
> Either way, these arrangements allow you to explore the hierarchical relationships in your data effectively!
