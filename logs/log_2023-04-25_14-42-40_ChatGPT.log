> The historical event that precipitated Japan's decision to "give up the gun" is usually associated with the Sakoku (鎖国, "closed country") policy, which was implemented during the Tokugawa Shogunate, also known as the Edo Period (1603-1868). However, it is essential to note that Japan did not completely abandon firearms but significantly limited their use and production during this time.
> 
> The Tokugawa Shogunate aimed to consolidate its power and maintain social stability by minimizing external influences, especially those of European countries. One key factor that led to this policy was the perceived threat of European influence through the introduction of Christianity and firearms. Japan had experienced a period of intense civil war called the Sengoku Period (1467-1615), during which firearms played a significant role in altering the nature of warfare. Guns, initially introduced by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, had rapidly spread among the warring factions and greatly impacted the power dynamics.
> 
> To suppress the spread of Christianity and limit the influence of foreign powers, the Tokugawa Shogunate implemented isolationist policies, which included severely restricting international trade and contact with foreign nations. As a result, firearms production and use decreased considerably. During the Edo Period, Japan became a largely peaceful society, and the samurai class focused more on the traditional martial arts, especially swordsmanship, rather than firearms.
> 
> Although this period of relative peace and isolation lasted for over two centuries, Japan eventually abandoned its Sakoku policy and opened its borders to trade and diplomacy during the Meiji Restoration in 1868. This led to rapid modernization and the reintroduction of firearms and other military technology.
