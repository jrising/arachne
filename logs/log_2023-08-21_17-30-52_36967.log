> I am writing a report on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. One form of infrastructure that can affect activities is pipes and submarine cables.
> 
> I have three kinds of pipes on a map:
> - Wastewater outfall pipes (there are several in upper bay and two along coast)
> - Other Pipeline Areas (again, several in the upper bay, a few at the mouth of the bay)
> - Submarine Cable Areas (several in the upper bay and near the mouth; also pipes that cut through the planning area further out to sea).
> 
> Here are additional details on the three datasets:
> 
> Wastewater outfall pipes:
> This database shows the location of publicly owned treatment works, and other significant point source discharges to surface waters at or near the contiguous U.S. coastline. Three types of features are provided in this database: facility location, outfall pipes, and the outfall discharge point. Outfall pipes and discharge points may not be present for some facilities due to a lack of source data. A facility can be linked to its outfall pipe, discharge point, and other National Pollution Discharge Elimination System records using the provided key field.
> 
> Other Pipeline Areas:
> These data show the general location of pipelines within U.S. waters. The geographic footprint for each pipeline may vary and is dependent on the original source data. In the near shore, pipelines are routinely buried below the seabed. Offshore, they are placed directly on the seabed. A pipeline area may contain one or more physical pipelines, and 30 CFR 585.301 defines a minimum 100-foot-wide right of way grant on each side of a pipeline.

> Submarine Cable Areas:
> These data show the general location of commercial and research submarine cables within U.S. waters. The majority of these cables are for telecommunications, and the remaining are for power transmission. The geographic footprint for each cable may vary and is dependent on the original source data. In the near shore, cables are routinely buried below the seabed. Offshore, they are placed directly on the seabed. A submarine cable area may contain one or more physical cables, and 30 CFR 585.301 defines a minimum 100-foot-wide right of way grant on each side of a cable.

> The Delaware marine waters are home to a dense network of diverse underwater infrastructures. First, there are numerous wastewater outfall pipes, part of public treatment works that discharge into the region's surface waters. This network is predominantly located in the upper bay, with a couple of additional paths along the coast. The availability and location of the outfall pipes and discharge points in this system may vary, owing to constraints in the available source data.   
> 
> Second, the waters harbor a variety of other pipelines placed either directly on the seabed offshore or buried beneath the seabed near the shore. Their physical presence is often clustered, with several overlapping within a single pipeline area, which is defined by a minimum 100-foot-wide right of way on each side of the pipeline according to 30 CFR 585.301. These pipelines are frequently found in the upper bay and a handful at the mouth of the bay.
> 
> Lastly, the marine waters crisscross a number of submarine cables used predominantly for telecommunications, alongside a smaller portion dedicated to power transmission. Much like the other pipelines, these cables are placed directly on the seabed offshore and buried beneath it near the shore. There are several such cable areas in the upper bay and near the mouth; moreover, there are cables which traverse the entire planning area out at sea. A submarine cable area sticks to the same principle with a minimum 100-foot-wide right of way on each side of a cable, as per 30 CFR 585.301.

> The Delaware marine waters are home to a variety of underwater infrastructures. These include wastewater outfall pipes, located in the upper bay and along the coast, which discharge into surface waters. The region also has a network of pipelines, both offshore and near the shore, with a 100-foot-wide right of way on each side. Additionally, there are submarine cables for telecommunications and power transmission, placed on the seabed offshore and buried near the shore. These cables are found in multiple areas, including the upper bay and near the mouth.
