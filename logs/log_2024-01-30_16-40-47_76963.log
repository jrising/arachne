**user**:
> I am writing a report on data gaps concerning activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, in support of a spatial planning process there. Amongst other materials, I am drawing upon two reports that have identified “Jurisdictions and Regulated Areas” as a data gap. Here is the discussion in Dewberry Engineers 2018:

> Abundance and distribution of marine mammals, birds, fish, and deep sea corals. These data are typically derived from data collected by federal and state agencies using at-sea transect surveys for avian species, trawl data for fish species, and aerial and shipboard surveys for cetacean species. The raw data need significant modeling and other synthesis to derive density maps and other more usable products.

> Data Issues or Needed Improvements:
> 					
> Abundance and distribution of marine mammals, birds, and fish are needed, especially in areas beyond the Atlantic (i.e. Gulf of Mexico, Pacific, Alaska, and Hawaii). Additionally, data on deep sea corals are needed in all areas. Data on invasive species (e.g. mussels and Asian carp) are of particular interest in the Great Lakes. Trend data showing change over time are also needed.
> 					
> Observation data are available but there is a need for updated modeled data and derived products. There are various ongoing modeling efforts that are funded by external entities and that depend on observation data sets. Trawl data sets are modeled to obtain three- to five-year averages for measuring abundance and change. Using AMAPS, Duke is modeling marine mammals, the National Center for Ocean Coastal Science (NCCOS) is modeling birds, and three geospatial products for fish species are being prepared by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. The DoD and Navy fund the development of annual, seasonal, and monthly distribution maps. The Duke team is also analyzing species sensitivity to noise and wind turbines.

> Data on corals are just starting to come in from NOAA (via Okeanos Explorer) including video and other data, but a more useful format is needed. The Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) is funding some analysis and synthesis for their portal. For sea turtles, data need to be more up to date, higher resolution, and include more species (only three are covered now).

> Trawl survey data, among others, are needed as soon as possible after collection and in uploadable, GIS-ready formats.

> Also, some of the data are not being served and there is no clear owner of the data. Some of the data may be held in studies performed at regional or local levels, and there is often a long lag time before publication. Varying levels of access to the modeled data are available. Access to the raw data should be provided as well as the modeled data and better documentation of the data processes and products is needed.

> The identified data gaps largely pertain to the abundance, distribution, and species-specific details of marine species, with a focus on animals such as marine mammals, birds, fish, and deep sea corals. The authorities collect this data, typically through at-sea transect surveys for avian species, trawl data for fish species, and aerial and shipboard surveys for cetacean species. Transforming the raw data into usable products, however, requires significant modeling and other synthesizing efforts (Dewberry Engineers, 2018; Trice et al., 2021).

> Notably, these improvements could provide better insights into a series of key issues related to offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience, climate adaptation, offshore renewable energy siting and leasing, species and habitat management, and oil and gas exploration among others (Dewberry Engineers, 2018).
> 
> There is a need for more data—both observation and modeled—especially in areas beyond the Atlantic, which includes Delaware's ocean and bay. A strong focus is necessary on invasive species, and trend data showing change over time is also critical (Dewberry Engineers, 2018). Trice et al. (2021) similarly highlighted the necessity of synthesizing observation data, developing modeled data, derived products, and regular updates to these models and products.
> 
> Dependable and continuous funding is essential to ensure that these models are maintained and refreshed. For creatures such as sea turtles, the data needs to be high resolution, current, and include a broader range of species. The data also needs to be available promptly after collection in GIS-ready formats. 
> 
> Additionally, the ownership of some data is unclear, and it is not always made available. The data, in some cases, may be part of studies carried out at regional levels, and the issue of long lag times before publication is a concern that needs to be addressed. Both raw and modeled data should be made available, and better documentation of data processes and products is necessary (Dewberry Engineers, 2018).

The identified data gaps could guide future data collection efforts to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of marine species and their environments.
