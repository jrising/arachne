> Yes, there are academic papers that discuss the "energy efficiency paradox," which refers to the phenomenon where consumers do not always adopt energy-efficient technologies, even when they seem economically rational. Implicit friction costs, such as transaction costs, behavioral biases, and informational barriers, are often cited as contributing factors. Here are a few papers that might be of interest:
> 
> 1. **Gillingham, K., & Palmer, K. (2014). "Bridging the energy efficiency gap: Policy insights from economic theory and empirical evidence."** This paper reviews economic explanations for the energy efficiency gap, including behavioral factors and market barriers.
> 
> 2. **Allcott, H., & Greenstone, M. (2012). "Is there an energy efficiency gap?" Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26(1), 3-28.** This paper provides a detailed examination of potential explanations for the energy efficiency gap, including the role of implicit costs.
> 
> 3. **Brown, M. A., & Wang, Y. (2015). "Green savings: How policies and markets drive energy efficiency." The topics discussed include various barriers and costs that prevent optimal energy efficiency adoption, including implicit friction costs.
> 
> These studies, among others, explore both the theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence of the factors that limit the uptake of energy-efficient technologies, shedding light on the implicit costs involved. You might also want to look into more recent literature for the most up-to-date discussions on these topics.
