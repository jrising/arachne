> In QGIS, I would like to control the order that features are drawn, so that features with a year attribute of 2000 are drawn before features with a year attribute of 2010. Is this possible?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can control the rendering order in QGIS based on attribute values. Here's how to accomplish this:
> 
> 1. Open your layer properties by right clicking on the layer in question and choose "Properties" from the drop-down menu.
> 
> 2. In the Layer Properties window that opens, click on the "Symbology" tab on the left side panel.
> 
> 3. At the bottom, there should be a check box labeled "Control feature rendering order". Select this box to enable the rendering order functionality.
> 
> 4. Upon enabling the feature, a pop-up box labeled "Control feature rendering order" will appear. Click on the "Expression" button beside it.
> 
> 5. In the "Expression" box that appears, you can define the attribute you want the rendering order to be based on. In your case, enter the name of your year field, e.g., "year". Then, choose the sort order of the attribute. For the objective you have specified, you should select 'Ascending'.
> 
> 6. Click 'OK' to close all dialogue boxes and apply the new rendering order.
> 
> After following these steps, the feature with year 2000 should appear beneath the feature with year 2010 when there is overlap. 
> 
> Keep in mind, this approach assumes that your 'year' column contains numerical data. If your year values are represented as text strings, you may need to convert them into numbers using an expression like `to_int("your_year_field")`.
