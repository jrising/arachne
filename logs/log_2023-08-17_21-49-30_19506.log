> What is the difference between a Marine National Monument and a National Marine Sanctuary?
**assistant**:
> The concepts of a Marine National Monument and a National Marine Sanctuary both involve the protection of marine areas, but they differ in their purpose, governance, and establishment process.
> 
> - **Marine National Monument**: This designation is most often used for the protection of specific natural features or ecosystems and can also include historical or cultural aspects. Such areas are established by the Presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act of 1906. Management of Marine National Monuments falls under federal agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Department of the Interior. 
> 
> - **National Marine Sanctuary**: These are areas of marine or Great Lakes waters that possess significant aesthetic, biological, cultural, or historical value. Designated by the U.S Congress or by the Secretary of Commerce under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, they are managed by the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries under NOAA. These sanctuaries promote comprehensive management, including research, education, conservation, and public use. There's often more focus on sustainable use and public access in National Marine Sanctuaries compared to Marine National Monuments.
> 
> Both designations support regional stewardship goals, offer opportunities for research and education, and provide varying degrees of protection from activities that could harm the marine and cultural resources within their boundaries. However, the regulations and allowed uses can differ significantly between specific monuments and sanctuaries, reflecting the specifics of their establishing legislation or proclamation.
