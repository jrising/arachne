**user**:
> What is returned by the `.each` command applied to a list of DOM elements, the function would return a promise?
**assistant**:
> The `.each()` function in jQuery is used to iterate over a set of DOM elements. However, it does not return a promise directly. Instead, it returns the original jQuery object that `.each()` was called on. This is to preserve chainability of jQuery methods.
> 
> If you want each iteration to execute an asynchronous operation and return a single promise that resolves when all operations have finished, you can use `.map()` to create an array of promises and then use `Promise.all()` to create a single promise that resolves when all promises in the array have resolved.
> 
> Here's an example:
> 
> ```javascript
> let promises = $(selector).map((index, element) => {
>     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
>         // ...asynchronous operation here...
>     });
> }).get();
> 
> Promise.all(promises)
>     .then(() => {
>         console.log("All operations finished.");
>     })
>     .catch(error => {
>         console.error("An operation failed: ", error);
>     });
> ```
> 
> In this snippet:
> 
> - `$(selector).map()` is used to iterate over the elements and create a new jQuery object that consists of the promises returned by the provided function.
> - `.get()` is used to convert the jQuery object to a plain JavaScript array.
> - `Promise.all(promises)` creates a single promise that resolves when all promises in the array have resolved.
> - The `.then()` block will be executed if all operations succeed.
> - The `.catch()` block will be executed if any operation fails.
