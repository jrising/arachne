> Dear Prof. Rising,
> 
> It is my pleasure to write to you. My name is Xiaodi Zhang and I am Associate Professor and Associate Researcher in Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. I am writing to explore the possible chance of becoming a visiting scholar in the field of Environmental Economics, Resource Economics, Carbon Footprint, carbon emission trading market and carbon tax, etc under your supervision at your famous institution. I am also prepared to participate your ongoing projects. My one year's visit would be fully funded by China Scholarship Council and my proposed length of staying would be one year, probably from December, 2024 to December, 2025.  
> 
> I have been Postdoctoral Fellow at School of Economics, Fudan University. And I obtained my PHD degree in Macroeconomics from Renmin University of China in 2011. I also received my master and bachelor degree from the same university.
> 
> I have hosted some national projects like National Natural Science Foundation of China (General Program): Research on the International Allocation Mechanism of FDI Carbon Footprint Tracking and Related Emission Reduction Responsibilities of Multinational Companies from the Perspective of Global Value Chain, National Social Science Foundation of China (Youth Program): Research on the DSGE Model of Compatibility between Carbon Tax Collection and Energy Technology Innovation under the Theory of Endogenous Technological Change, National Natural Science Foundation of China (Youth Program): Exploration of the Relationship between Carbon Emission Level and Total Cost of Elements in China.
> 
> During the past years, I have published some papers including Correctly Understand and Grasp the Systematic Planning and Overall Deployment of Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in China——Interpretation of Spirit and Mentality Related to Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality of the Party Central Committee in the New Development Stage, Optimization of Public Fiscal Policy under Multi-Objective System of Economy and Environment: Multi-Objective System Decision Model Based on the CGE Framework, Analysis of Welfare and Impact on Employment of Differentiated Carbon Tax: Simulation under the Intertemporal CGE Framework, Research on Carbon Tax Collection and Developing Renewable Energy: Analysis of Growth and Welfare Effects Based on the OLG-CGE Model, Measurement of Impact of Carbon Tax Collection on Prices, Welfare, and Equity in China, Research on Industrial Structure Optimization under Constraints of Growth, Employment, and Emission Reduction Goals.

**assistant**:
> Dear Xiaodi Zhang,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Your research in Environmental Economics and Carbon Footprint analysis aligns well with our ongoing projects. Given your qualifications and experience, I believe you would be a strong candidate for our Ph.D. programme in Environmental Economics or an ongoing research project at the School of Marine Science & Policy.
> 
> However, funding is always a constraint in our ability to bring on new scholars. I would encourage you to include my name in your statement of purpose or project proposals, as your interests align significantly with my research focus on climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. This would improve your consideration for any available funds.
> 
> Do ensure to get your application submitted by the end of the calendar year so that you can be adequately considered for any available funding opportunities.
