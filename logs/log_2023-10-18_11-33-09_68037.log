> What is the infinite sum of X / (1 + d)^t, over t?
**assistant**:
> The infinite sum of X / (1 + d)^t, over t from t = 0 to infinity, is actually a formula for the present value of a *perpetuity*. A perpetuity refers to a series of equal infinite payments or cash flows that occur at regular intervals. The formula to calculate the present value of a perpetuity is as follows:
> 
>     PV = X / d
> 
> Here, X is the payment or cash inflow at the end of each single period, and d is the discount rate per period. It is assumed that the first payment isn't made until one period hence.
> 
> Remember, X and d need to belong to the same period. So if X is annual interest, d should also be an annual discount rate.
