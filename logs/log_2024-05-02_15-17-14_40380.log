> IT IS WELL-KNOWN that collective well-being can be increased if all countries cooperate in managing shared environmental resources like the climate and ozone layer, but that if this improved situation is attained, every country will earn even higher returns by free-riding on the virtuous behavior of the remaining cooperators. However, the fact that countries can do better if cooperation can be sustained suggests that countries have incentives to develop institutions which can punish free riding. Such institutions do in fact exist in the form of international environmental agreements (lEAs). Indeed, more than 100 lEAs are currently in force, the most recent of which include the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The essential feature of lEAs is that they must be self-enforcing. No country can be forced to sign an lEA, and signatories to an lEA can always withdraw from the agreement. If lEAs can improve the management of shared environmental resources, they must make it attractive for countries to want to sign, and to want to carry out the terms of the agreement. This paper employs some concepts from game theory to explore the properties of self-enforcing lEAs.
> Two different approaches are considered. The first is a model in which the number of signatories, the terms of the agreement, and the actions of non- signatories are all determined endogenously. This model assumes that signatories maximize their collective net benefits, recognizing how their choice of treaty obligations affects the actions of nonsignatories, while nonsignatories each choose their actions on the assumption that other countries will not respond. The mechanism that sustains the lEA is as follows. When a country joins the lEA, the other signatories increase their abatement levels, and hence reward the country for acceding to the agreement; when a country withdraws, the remaining signatories reduce their abatement levels, and hence punish the country for withdrawing from the agreement. These punishments and rewards are credible, because the signatories always maximize their collective net benefits. However, the magnitude of the punishments and rewards may not be sufficiently large to sustain a self-enforcing lEA consisting of many countries. Depending on the functional specification, Section 2 of this paper shows that the self-enforcing lEA may not exist, or it may consist of no more than two or

> three countries, or it may support up to as many countries as share the resource (depending in this last case on parameter values).
> The other approach is to model the lEA as an infinitely repeated game. This approach has the attraction of increasing credible punishments compared with the other model, but it has the drawback of not solving endogenously for the number of signatories, the terms of the agreement, and the actions of non- signatories. Instead, this model can be employed to calculate the maximum number of countries that could support the full cooperative outcome. While the folk theorem guarantees that the full cooperative outcome can be sustained by any number of countries provided the rate of discount is sufficiently small, we shall see in Section 3 that this result may not hold for a self-enforcing IEA.1 The reason is that the punishments that sustain the full cooperative outcome may be vulnerable to renegotiation, and a self-enforcing lEA must clearly be renegotiation-proof. As with the previous model, the ability of the infinitely- repeated game to sustain the full cooperative outcome depends on the functional specification and parameter values.
> These different models yield one consistent and striking result. The first model shows that for global environmental problems, an lEA may achieve a high degree of cooperation, but only when the difference between global net benefits under the noncooperative and full cooperative outcomes is small. When this difference is large, a self-enforcing lEA cannot support a large number of signatory countries.' The second model shows that the maximum number of countries that can sustain the full cooperative outcome may be large, but only when the difference between global net benefits under the noncooperative and full cooperative outcomes is small. When this difference is large, the full cooperative outcome cannot be sustained by a self-enforcing lEA.
> By necessity, the analysis imposes a number of restrictive assumptions, and the above result must be seen in the light of these. The most important assumptions are: (i) that all countries are identical; (ii) that each country's net benefit function is known by all countries, and known to be known by all countries; (iii) that the choice instrument is restricted to pollution abatement; (iv) that abatement levels are instantly and costlessly observable; (v) that the pollutant does not accumulate in the environment; and (iv) that the cost functions are independent. Further research is needed to learn whether the basic conclusion of this paper would be upset by changes in these assumptions."
> 1 Of course, the folk theorem only asserts that any feasible individually rational payoffs can be supported as a Nash equilibrium if the game is repeated infinitely often and players are sufficiently patient. Hence, the full cooperative outcome is only one among many supergame equilibria.
> 2 Unless, of course, the agreement merely codifies the noncooperative outcome.
> 3 A number of studies have considered these issues, but not within the context of the models presented in this paper. Black et al. (1993) consider information asymmetries in a model where the agreement specifies the minimum number of countries that must sign the agreement for it to come into force. With complete information, the solution to their model would trivially require that all countries sign the agreement. Such an agreement would not, however, be (ex post) self-enforcing. Barrett (1992) considers the implications for reaching a negotiated agreement when countries are different and may select different policy instruments (abatement levels, pollution taxes, and tradeable emission entitlements), but this study does not require that the agreement that is reached

According to (1), the marginal benefit of the first unit of abatement for i is ablN, and that of the ath is zero." The parameter b is the slope of the global marginal benefit function (found by summing (l) over all N countries, and differentiating with respect to Q).

Denote i's net benefits by n, (i.e., n, = Bi(Q) - Ci(qJ), and denote global net benefits by II (i.e., II = LinJ The full cooperative outcome is found by choosing Q to maximize II. The solution requires setting each country's marginal cost of abatement (MCJ equal to the global marginal benefit of abatement (M B), and is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Carraro and Siniscalco (1991) consider a model in which signatories to an lEA may choose side payments to induce nonsignatories to accede to the lEA, but for signatories to want to make such side payments, it is essential that these countries commit to certain abatement levels, and such a commitment is inconsistent with the notion of self- enforcement. Maler (1989) and Hoel (1990) analyze cooperative solutions to the control of persistent pollutants, but which are not subject to a self-enforcement constraint. Finally, Heal (1992) considers the case where each country's abatement costs depend on the abatement actions of other countries, as well as its own, but evaluates only the Nash noncooperative equilibrium.
> 4 The problem specified here does not impose an upper bound on each country's abatement effort. Clearly, emissions must be at least as great as a units, since the marginal benefit of abating a units is zero. To solve the problem we can assume that emissions exceed a by a sufficient margin so that the maximal abatement constraint is never binding.

The solution requires setting each country's own marginal benefit of abatement (denoted MBi in Fig. 1) equal to its own marginal cost of abatement. Denoting Qo global abatement and qoany individual country's abatement under the noncooperative or open access outcome, we find

> It is clear from Fig. 1 that the difference between global net benefits under the full cooperative and non-cooperative outcomes depends on the slopes of the marginal abatement cost and benefit curves. Let ITc and ITo denote global net benefits under full cooperation and open access, respectively. Then we have:
> Lemma 1 Let O(N) = [J(N 2 + 8N)-N]/4. Then (i) ITc - ITo increases in b when y > O(N) and decreases in b when y < O(N) for c given; (ii) ITc - ITo increases in c for y fixed; and (iii) 0 is monotonic and approaches a value of 1 as N becomes very large.
> Proof See Appendix.
> Lemma 1 tells us that the gains to cooperation (ITe - ITo) are larger the closer y is to O(N) and the larger is c. For global environmental problems, N exceeds 100 and 0 ~ 1. When c is small and b is large, unilateral abatement is substantial, and the gains to cooperation are relatively small. When c is large and b is small, countries will not abate their emissions by much, even if cooperation is full. When c ~ b and both parameter values are small, Qe - Qo will be large, but the gains to cooperation will be small. When c ~ b and both

> 2.1.2. The self-enforcing IEA. Suppose that a number of countries negotiate an lEA. Clearly, the number of signatories, the terms of the lEA, and the abatement levels of nonsignatories must be determined jointly. It seems reasonable to suppose that nonsignatories will choose their abatement levels taking as given the abatement decisions of all other countries. Let IY. denote the proportion of countries that sign the lEA. There are then IY.N signatories and (1 - IY.)N nonsignatories. Let Qn denote the abatement of all nonsignatories, and let qn denote the abatement of any individual nonsignatory. Since all nonsignatories are identical, Qn = (l - IY.)Nqn. The reaction functions of nonsignatories are given by

> Substituting (6) into (5) yields
> Q:(IY.) =a(l - IY.)(Y +1- IY.)/[(y +1- IY.)2 +IY.2Ny] (7)
> It is easily verified that the full cooperative (IY. = 1) and noncooperative (IY. = 0) solutions, given by eqs (3) and (4) respectively, are special cases of (6) and (7).
> The remaining problem is to determine IY.*N, or the number of signatories to the self-enforcing lEA. In determining IY.*, it will prove helpful to invoke a concept of stability developed for the analysis of cartels (d'Aspremont et al. 1983). Let 11:s be the net benefit of every signatory and 11:n that of every nonsignatory.

Similarly, no nonsignatory, acting alone, would want
> 6 The assumption that the qs are identical is easily justified. If the problem of signatories agreeing on individual country obligations is modelled as a cooperative game, then it can be shown that if all signatories are identical, the Nash bargaining solution will require that each country undertake the same level of abatement.

> The concept is best understood by considering an example. Let N = 10, a = 100, b = 1, and c = 0.25; and denote global net benefits by II(cx); i.e. II(ex) = «Nn, + (l - cx)N1rn- Table 1 shows the net benefit and abatement levels corresponding to each possible ex, and Fig. 2 illustrates the example. To solve forex*,startatex=°andcompare1rn(O) with1rs(O.l). Clearly,476.8>472.0,and hence it will playa nonsignatory to accede to the agreement. Now compare 1rn(O.l) with 1rs(O.2). Again, 474.0 > 468.1, and it will pay a nonsignatory to cooperate. Continuing in this way one finds that nonsignatories always do better by acceding when ex < 0.4. Likewise, starting at ex = 1.0, one finds that signatories always do better by withdrawing from the agreement whenever ex > 0.4. Hence, an lEA consisting of four signatories is the only self-enforcing lEA for this problem."
> 7 The concept of self-enforcement defined by (8) was first employed by Barrett (1989), but has also been used by Carraro and Siniscalco (1991) and Hoel (1992). The essential feature of (8) is that it does not consider whether coalitions of two or more countries would want to accede to or withdraw from the lEA. Heal (1992) defines a related concept which he calls the minimum critical coalition. This is a group of countries S, which (i) adopts an abatement policy yielding each member of S positive net benefits, and (ii) does not contain a proper subset of countries which yields its members positive net benefits.
> 8 Notice that 1rs(ct* + liN) - 1rs(ct*) > 1rn(ct*) - 1rs(c(* + liN) in this example. This implies that signatories to a self-enforcing lEA have an incentive to offer a side payment to nonsignatories to join the agreement. The difficulty is that the agreement to offer a side payment is not self-enforcing. While the signatories to the self-enforcing lEA have a collective incentive to offer a side payment to a nonsignatory, each of the original signatories would do better still by withdrawing from the agreement since 1rn(ct*) > 1rs(ct* + liN) (by definition).
> Carraro and Siniscalco (1991) propose a way out of this dilemma. They show that if the signatories to the self-enforcing lEA can commit themselves to cooperate whatever the magnitude of IY., then the total number of signatories can be increased (although the full cooperative outcome may still be unattainable). The snag in this proposal, as noted in footnote 2, is that the commitment is not credible; the expanded agreement is not self-enforcing. If commitment could be made credible, then the full cooperative outcome would be easy to sustain: every country would simply commit to choose the full cooperative abatement level qc.

However, simulations reveal a very simple and compelling relationship between }' and a*, and between }' and the ability of an lEA to close the gap between the full cooperative and non- cooperative outcomes.
> 2.1.3. Simulations. Table 2 presents solutions to a*N for various values of b and c when N = 100.9 It is clear from the simulations that the number of signatories to the self-enforcing lEA increases as }' decreases. It is encouraging to find that a self-enforcing lEA can consist of many signatories, if only when }' is small. However, Lemma 1 demonstrated that if}' is small, then the difference between global net benefits under the full cooperative and noncooperative outcomes will also be small. Hence, lEAs signed by many countries do not increase global net benefits by very much compared with the non-cooperative outcome. Indeed, Tables 3 and 4, which give the total abatement and net benefit figures corresponding to a selection of nine cells from Table 2, confirm that the self-enforcing lEA increases global abatement and global net benefits by very little when}' is small. These results suggest that lEAs signed by a large number of countries have very little effect.

> The situation is very different where c and b are both large. As Lemma 1 showed, it is here that the difference between global net benefits under the noncooperative and full cooperative outcomes is large. Table 4 confirms this. But from Table 2 we see that few countries are likely to sign an lEA for such a pollutant.
> Proposition 1 For global environmental problems characterized by eqs (1) and (2), the self-enforcing lEA will be signed by a lot of countries, each undertaking substantial abatement, when y is small, but under these circumstances the lEA increases global net benefits by very little compared with the noncooperative outcome. Cooperation would increase net benefits substantially when c and b are both large, but under these circumstances the self-enforcing lEA cannot sustain a large number of signatories.
> Table 5 shows the magnitude of free riding for these simulations. Signatories abate more than they would in the absence of an lEA, while nonsignatories abate less. When y = 1, only three countries cooperate. Every signatory abates significantly more than under the noncooperative outcome, and every non- signatory just a little less. But because there are so many more nonsignatories in this case, the free-rider effect is huge in total and the lEA has little overall impact. When y = 0.01, there are 51 signatories. In this case the free-rider effect is small-but so too is the additional abatement of signatories. Again, the self-enforcing lEA has little overall impact. Finally, Table 6 shows the net benefit levels corresponding to the abatement levels in Table 5. All countries receive higher net benefits when there exists a self-enforcing lEA compared with the noncooperative outcome, but nonsignatories take a free ride on signatories.

> for which N is large. As N becomes small, the effect of withdrawal or accession by any country on the abatement level of the other cooperators increases, and hence free riding can be punished more effectively. To take an example, suppose N = 5, a = 100 and c = b = 1. Then the self-enforcing lEA consists of three countries with Qo = 50, Q(cx*) = 63 and Qc = 83; and with ITo = 3,500, IT(cx*) = 3,869, and ITc = 4,162. In this case, the self-enforcing lEA is able to close the gap between the noncooperative outcomes quite substantially.

In that case, the marginal abatement cost function (11) is the same form as was estimated by Nordhaus (1990) for US carbon dioxide emissions. l l Since Nordhaus's model also assumes constant marginal benefits, eqs (9) and (10) describe Nordhaus's model of the greenhouse effect. However, Nordhaus does not disaggregate to the individual country level. Here it is assumed that all countries are identical and have the same cost and benefit functions. 12 The solution to this problem, like the previous one, can be derived analytically.

According to the specifications examined in this section, the number of signatories may be limited to just a few whatever parameter values characterise the problem being investigated.':' However, the results of all specifications considered here are consistent in one respect: when N is large, an agreement achieving substantial emission reductions over and above the non-cooperative levels is not self-enforcing.
> 3. lEAs as repeated games
> The preceding model is unable to sustain the full cooperative outcome in general because its punishments, though credible, are small. It is well known that the full cooperative outcome of the one-shot game can be sustained as a sub-game perfect equilibrium of the infinitely repeated game if the rate of discount is sufficiently small. However, this section will show that repetition may not allow lEAs to sustain the full cooperative outcome, even for arbitrarily small discount rates, because the punishments that sustain cooperation in infinitely repeated games may be vulnerable to renegotiation, and such punishments could not be supported by a self-enforcing lEA.

> on the parameter values, and is higher the larger is b and the smaller is d. It can be shown that ITc- ITo = dl(N - 1)2/2b for specification (13). The last column in Table 7 indicates that when N is large, the difference ITc - ITo is small, and that when N is small, the difference ITc- TIo may be very large. These results are reminiscent of those obtained in Section 2.1. Clearly, even infinite repetition may not allow the lEA to sustain the full cooperative outcome when lEAs must be self-enforcing.17
> 4. Conclusions
> This paper has shown that self-enforcing international environmental agree- ments (lEAs), which establish rules for managing shared environmental re- sources, may not be able to improve substantially upon the noncooperative outcome. Two different modelling approaches support this conclusion. The model of a self-enforcing lEA, which solves jointly for the number of signatories, the terms of the lEA, and the actions of nonsignatories, shows that, depending on the functional specification, a self-enforcing lEA may not exist, or it may not be able to sustain more than two or three signatory countries, in which case the lEA cannot increase global net benefits substantially when the number of countries that share the resource is very large. For one functional specification, the self-enforcing lEA can sustain a large number of signatories-up to as many as share the resource-but only when the difference in net benefits between the noncooperative and full cooperative outcomes is very small. When this difference is very large, the self-enforcing lEA can sustain only a small number of signatories, and hence can only marginally improve upon the noncooperative
> 17 Barrett (1994) carries out a similar analysis for the conservation of biological diversity, a global public good, but using a different functional form. Though this model can only be evaluted using simulation, the analysis arrives at a similar conclusion.

> outcome when the environmental resource is shared globally. The other model, which takes the lEA to be an equilibrium to an infinitely repeated game, but one which is renegotiation-proof, shows that the full cooperative outcome can be sustained by a large number of countries, but only when the difference in global net benefits between the noncooperative and full cooperative outcomes is small. When this difference is large, the full cooperative outcome can be sustained by only a few countries, or possibly by none at all.
> Despite the arguably harsh assumptions that underpin these models, it is tempting to consider an actual lEA in the light of this analysis. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, originally negotiated in 1987, has now been signed by about 80 countries, and in its original form committed each signatory to cut its production and consumption of the so-called hard CFCs by 50%.18 This agreement is understandably considered to be a substantial achievement of international cooperation."? However, when seen in the context of this paper, an analysis of ozone depletion by the US Environmental Protection Agency (1988) suggests that the Montreal Protocol may not have increased global net benefits substantially compared with the noncooperative outcome. Assuming 'substantialleve1s of participation by other nations', the EPA estimates that the US would receive a benefit, primarily in the form of a reduction in the incidence of skin cancers, of $3,575bn, and incur a cost of $21bn, if it acceded to the treaty. If the US cut its production and consumption of CFCs by 50% unilaterally, the cost to the US would remain unchanged, but the benefit to the US would fall to only $1,373bn. While one would ideally like to know the marginal costs and benefits, these total benefit and cost figures strongly suggest that the US had an incentive to carry out the terms of the Montreal Protocol unilaterally. There is no compelling reason to believe that these benefit and cost estimates would be wildly different for most othercountriesinrelativeterms,andso,iftheEPA'sfiguresarebroadlycorrect and consistent with the beliefs of the Montreal Protocol negotiators, it seems that this agreement may not have achieved as much as is commonly claimed.
> That conclusion is consistent with the analysis presented in this paper.
> 18 The agreement has since been amended, and strengthened in a number of respects. 19 But see the analysis by Bohm (1990).
