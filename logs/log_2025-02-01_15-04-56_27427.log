> Can you "merge" the two sets of comments below (reviews of an ongoing grant project)? Keep wording the same wherever possible.
> ===
> Review 1:
> 
> TransformAr has built upon the state-of-the-art in climate impact projections and economic assessment to translate evidence relevant to stakeholders into actionable information, including identifying regions with the greatest need for adaptation (WP2).
> 
> TransformAr has also engaged in a wide range of green, grey, and hybrid adaptation projects across the six demonstrators (WP4). These projects have been paired with carefully developed stakeholder engagement practices, which are broadly applicable for adaptation planning across the EU (WP3).
> 
> The project has shown good progress in achieving its all of its objectives.
> 
> However, there are deviations during this reporting period which may not be acceptable:
> 
> There is a significant disconnect between WP2 and work packages that would benefit from its outputs (WP3 and the cost-benefit work in WP6). Even recognizing that delays in the availability of data make some of these connections challenging, it is problematic that stakeholder planning processes appear ill-designed to incorporate risk information.
> 
> There is also a lack of information flowing from WP4 and WP5 into the cost-benefit work in WP6.
> ===
> Review 2:
> 
> The project has largely achieved its aims to develop products and services for transformational adaptation in the vulnerable European regions and communities that fall under the scope of the project, which includes the 6 ‘lighthouse demonstrator’ communities and regions. The project has tested and demonstrated 21 actionable adaptive solutions, which is an impressive number. 
> Various innovation outputs in the pilot/case studies have been achieved. Governance related innovations include the development of a climate resilience index in Galicia, coastal contracts which fostered cross-sectoral cooperation for wetland management, and a climate innovation hub that supports decision making in Egaleo. New nature-based solutions that have been installed include biofiltration areas in Lappeenranta, a SMART GATE system to monitor water levels in wetlands in Oristano, and riparian buffers and floodplain wetlands in the West Country Region (UK). Innovative digital and technological solutions include an intertidal and mussel raft monitoring systems in Galicia, and smart climate stations in Egaleo. New financial solutions include the design of a payment for ecosystem services scheme in West Country Region (UK), and the development of an adaptation fund in Guadeloupe.     
> The project made several important contributions to the state-of-the-art. The project developed an extensive stakeholder engagement approach for the design of adaptation pathways using an impressive number of workshops. The project contributed to climate risk assessment methodologies, by developing novel computable general equilibrium model analysis of macroeconomic impacts of climate change. The project contributed to understanding of individual preferences for climate adaptation options through extensive cross-country Discrete Choice Experiment survey analyses. 
> Although the scientific quality varies between the deliverables, the overall quality of the project is good. Methods generally follow the state-of-the-art and make the aforementioned scientific contributions. Examples of high-quality results include the extensive co-design process of designing adaptation pathways with stakeholders and the discrete-choice experiment analysis. However, some deliverables need corrections as explained below under recommendations. For example, in WP3 results it should be clarified how the qualitative and/or quantitative assessments of the adaptation pathways in the multi-criteria analysis were performed to arrive at a preferred pathway.
> 
> The work carried out enhances innovation capacity with regards to climate adaptation measures and strategies. The work involves companies and is expected to benefit the competitiveness of these companies. The project delivers climate adaptation solutions which addresses important societal needs at the community and regional level to limit future impacts from climate change.
> 
> The project engaged in many communication and dissemination efforts which enhanced awareness about the project and communicated its achievements through large and various audiences through active communication using videos, the website, social media and non-scientific publications and press releases. The project made progress with disseminating results through 3 scientific publications, but most scientific publications still have to materialize.
> 
> There is a plan for the acquiring of relevant property right in the form of the mid-term update of communication and dissemination plan (deliverable 7.9), which has been completed and is appropriate.
> 
> Significant progress was made in the second reporting period. The overall project made satisfactory progress in relation to the DoA with the achievement of the objectives of the project. In particular, SO1, SO2, and SO3 are met, while some research and other activities for SO4, SO5 and SO6 are still ongoing. The activities in the work packages are largely in compliance with the work plan, with minor deviations which are overall well justified. Most deliverables have been accepted. There are recommended revisions of some of the deliverables, as explained under recommendations. All milestones except for one (number 13) are completed and accepted.

> TransformAr has largely achieved its aims to develop products and services for transformational adaptation in the vulnerable European regions and communities within its scope, including the 6 'lighthouse demonstrator' communities and regions. The project has built upon the state-of-the-art in climate impact projections and economic assessment to translate evidence relevant to stakeholders into actionable information, notably identifying regions with the greatest need for adaptation (WP2).

While progress in disseminating results through three scientific publications was made, most have yet to materialize. A mid-term update of the communication and dissemination plan (deliverable 7.9) has been completed appropriately for acquiring relevant property rights.
> 
> Overall, significant progress was made in the second reporting period with satisfactory advancement towards the DoA. While SO1, SO2, and SO3 are met, research for SO4, SO5, and SO6 continues. Most work package activities are compliant with the work plan, with well-justified minor deviations. Deliverables, mostly accepted, have recommended revisions per recommendations, with only one milestone (number 13) not yet completed and accepted.
> 
> However, there are deviations during this reporting period which may not be acceptable: a significant disconnect exists between WP2 and benefitting work packages (WP3 and the cost-benefit work in WP6). Delayed data availability poses challenges, yet stakeholder planning processes appear ill-designed to incorporate risk information. Additionally, there's a lack of information flow from WP4 and WP5 into WP6.
