> In ggplot2, I am using geom_point with alpha=.1 to give a kind of heat map. However, the legends also have alpha=.1, making it difficult to see the colors. How can I fix this?
**assistant**:
> In ggplot2, this problem can be resolved by modifying the alpha value solely for the legend. To do this you could make use of the `override.aes` parameter that is part of `guide_legend`, which overrides the aesthetics displayed in the legend. For instance:
> 
> ```r
> # Assuming df is your data frame and X, Y and Col are the variables.
> p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=X, y=Y, color=Col)) +
>   geom_point(alpha=.1)
> 
> p <- p + guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
> ```
> 
> In this example, `guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))` overrides the alpha levels set for the plot, and applies alpha as 1 for the legend, making it fully opaque. Thus, your points will still be displayed with `alpha=.1` in the plot but the legend will have `alpha=1`, making the colors easy to see.
