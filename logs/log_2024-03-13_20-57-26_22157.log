> What is it called when a certain value is used in source code to mean something different from the normal scalar meaning of that variable?
**assistant**:
> It sounds like you're referring to a "magic number" or "magic constant." These are direct usage of numbers, strings or other values in the source code which have a unique meaning. They are considered bad practice because they can make the code less flexible and harder to understand or maintain.
> 
> If you're referring to a variable that changes its meaning in different contexts, such variables could be described as "overloaded variables" or "context-dependent variables," although this is less typical and generally discouraged in programming due to the potential confusion and difficulty in maintenance it can create.
**user**:
> I thought there was a term like "semaphore", maybe it was old.
**assistant**:
> Yes, you may be thinking of the term "flag variable" or "flag" in programming. In some contexts, a flag variable is a variable used to indicate a particular condition or to control the flow of a program. It can act as a signal, similar to a semaphore, to trigger specific actions or behaviors in the code. Flag variables are commonly used in programming to simplify logic or make certain conditions more explicit in the code.
