> Dear Dr. Rising,

> My name is Nick Bartocci and I am a senior at Newark Charter High School. I participated in Electrical Engineering research at University of Delaware last year. I am the Delaware Chapter Leader of Research Student Connection, an organization that aims to connect excellent high school students throughout DE with research opportunities in a variety of fields. As of right now, research is a field that many can find hard to get involved with. We aim to make research opportunities more accessible to everyone. Currently, we are contacting research groups and professors to see if there is any interest in taking in high school students to conduct their own research project or simply assist an undergraduate or professional researcher. We believe that you, as a researcher at UD would be a great option to participate in this program. If you have any interest in participating in this program, please let us know. Attached will be a website regarding our organization and the program. We currently have labs from Penn State Berks, Penn State Altoona, DelVal, Cleveland Clinic Florida, University of Houston Clear Lake, and a few other institutions. If you would like to meet over Zoom to discuss plans, let us know when you are available or book a meeting at this link: https://calendly.com/researchstudentconnection/research-student-connection-interest-labs! We would love to communicate ideas and plans with you. Thank you for your time.
