> In Javascript (I'm using flowbite, if it matters), how can I make a text field that submits when the return key is pressed, but not when shift-return is?
**assistant**:
> To create a text field in JavaScript that submits when the return key is pressed but not when shift-return is, you can add an event listener to the text field to listen for the 'keydown' event. In the event handler, you can check if the return key is pressed, and if the shift key is not pressed, then submit the form. Here's an example:
> 
> First, you need to include your text field in your HTML. Make sure to reference the ID in the JavaScript event listener.
> 
> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html lang="en">
> <head>
>     <meta charset="UTF-8">
>     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>     <title>Example</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <form id="myForm">
>         <input type="text" id="myTextField">
>         <input type="submit" value="Submit">
>     </form>
>     <script src="main.js"></script>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> 
> Now, create an event listener in JavaScript in your "main.js" file:
> 
> ```javascript
> document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
>     var textField = document.getElementById('myTextField');
> 
>     textField.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {
>         if (event.key === 'Enter' && !event.shiftKey) {
>             event.preventDefault();
>             document.getElementById('myForm').submit();
>         }
>     });
> });
> ```
> 
> In this example, we check for two conditions: if the pressed key is 'Enter' and if the 'shiftKey' property of the event is not true. If both conditions are met, we prevent the default behavior using `event.preventDefault()` and submit the form manually with `document.getElementById('myForm').submit()`.
