**user**:
> How do I check if a url ends with ".pdf"?
**assistant**:
> To check if a URL ends with ".pdf", you can use Python's built-in `str.endswith()` function. Here is a simple example:
> 
> ```python
> url = "http://example.com/somefile.pdf"
> 
> if url.endswith(".pdf"):
>     print("This URL points to a PDF file.")
> else:
>     print("This URL does not point to a PDF file.")
> ```
> 
> In this code, `url.endswith(".pdf")` returns `True` if the string stored in `url` ends with ".pdf", and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the `if` statement checks whether or not the URL ends with ".pdf", and prints a message accordingly.
