> Storing pizza in the freezer in its original box as opposed to a plastic container can indeed lead to a difference in taste and texture over time, and the difference could become more noticeable if the pizza is frozen for several weeks.
> 
> The original pizza box does not provide a very tight seal, which can lead to a couple of issues:
> 
> 1. **Freezer Burn:** Because the box won't fully seal, air can come into contact with the pizza, which can lead to freezer burn. Freezer burn doesn't make food unsafe, but it can affect the taste and texture of the food. The toppings and cheese may become dried out and have a slightly off flavor.
> 
> 2. **Absorption of Odors:** Freezers often contain a variety of other foods, many of which have strong smells. Over time, these smells can be absorbed by food that isn't fully sealed, including pizza in a box. This can definitely impact the taste and freshness of the pizza.
> 
> On the other hand, a plastic container or freezer bag creates a better seal, protecting the pizza from both the risk of freezer burn and absorbing unwanted odors. 
> 
> To summarize, while it's perfectly safe to freeze pizza in its original box, you might find that the flavors are not preserved as well as they would be if you used a sealed plastic container or freezer bag. This is particularly true for longer periods of storage.
