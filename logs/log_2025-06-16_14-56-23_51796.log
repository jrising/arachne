> I have code that renders html with <ins>...</ins> and <del>...</del>, but I want to change the formatting, so the <del> text is just blank and the <ins> text is in bold green. How can I do that?
**assistant**:
> You can achieve this by using CSS to override the default styling of the `<ins>` and `<del>` tags. Here's how you can style them:
> 
> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html lang="en">
> <head>
>     <meta charset="UTF-8">
>     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>     <title>Styled Insertions and Deletions</title>
>     <style>
>         del {
>             display: none;
>         }
>         ins {
>             font-weight: bold;
>             color: green;
>             text-decoration: none;
>         }
>     </style>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <p>This is some text that was <del>deleted</del> and this is some <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> 
> Here's what this does:
> - The `del` selector hides any text within `<del>...</del>` by setting `display: none;`, making it disappear from the rendered page.
> - The `ins` selector makes any text within `<ins>...</ins>` bold by setting `font-weight: bold;`, and changes its color to green via `color: green;`. The `text-decoration: none;` removes the default underline from the `<ins>` tag.
> 
> You can incorporate this styling directly into your HTML document or add it to a separate CSS file if you prefer to keep your styles organized that way.
