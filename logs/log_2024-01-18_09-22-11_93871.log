> I am trying to confirm that my ubuntu server does not have ffmpeg. I cannot run the ffmpeg command, but I feel like I should look where the files would be installed, just to check that they aren't there. Where should I look?
**assistant**:
> FFmpeg usually keeps its executable files in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`. You can check it with the "which" or "whereis" commands; these will return the path if FFmpeg is installed.
> 
> You would need to ssh into your Ubuntu server and then you can run these commands:
> 
> ```bash
> which ffmpeg
> ```
> or
> 
> ```bash
> whereis ffmpeg
> ```
> 
> If FFmpeg were installed you would receive an output such as `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`. If no output is produced, then ffmpeg is not installed.
> 
> Of course, it's possible that the binary has been installed elsewhere, for example by compiling the source code and setting a custom path. However, this would not be typical.
> 
> If you want to search the entire system, you could use the `find` command. Do note that this could take a considerable amount of time depending on the speed and usage of your server. Here would be the command:
> 
> ```bash
> find / -name ffmpeg 2>/dev/null
> ```
> 
> This will search your drive for any file named ffmpeg and discard any error messages you would otherwise get from directories you do not have permission to search. If FFmpeg is anywhere to be found on the system, this will find it, assuming it is named ffmpeg.
