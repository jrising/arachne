> I am using the `ranger` package in R to estimate random forests. My call is: `ranger(dimpact ~ ., data=values, num.trees=500, max.depth=12, verbose=TRUE)`, where the other columns included (the dot in the equation) are explained elsewhere. Here is the R description of the ranger function:
> ```
> Description
> 
> Ranger is a fast implementation of random forests (Breiman 2001) or recursive partitioning, particularly suited for high dimensional data. Classification, regression, and survival forests are supported. Classification and regression forests are implemented as in the original Random Forest (Breiman 2001), survival forests as in Random Survival Forests (Ishwaran et al. 2008). Includes implementations of extremely randomized trees (Geurts et al. 2006) and quantile regression forests (Meinshausen 2006).

> The tree type is determined by the type of the dependent variable. For factors classification trees are grown, for numeric values regression trees and for survival objects survival trees. The Gini index is used as default splitting rule for classification. For regression, the estimated response variances or maximally selected rank statistics (Wright et al. 2016) can be used. For Survival the log-rank test, a C-index based splitting rule (Schmid et al. 2015) and maximally selected rank statistics (Wright et al. 2016) are available. For all tree types, forests of extremely randomized trees (Geurts et al. 2006) can be grown.
> 
> With the probability option and factor dependent variable a probability forest is grown. Here, the node impurity is used for splitting, as in classification forests. Predictions are class probabilities for each sample. In contrast to other implementations, each tree returns a probability estimate and these estimates are averaged for the forest probability estimate. For details see Malley et al. (2012).
> 
> Note that nodes with size smaller than min.node.size can occur because min.node.size is the minimal node size to split at, as in original Random Forests. To restrict the size of terminal nodes, set min.bucket. Variables selected with always.split.variables are tried additionally to the mtry variables randomly selected. In split.select.weights, weights do not need to sum up to 1, they will be normalized later. The weights are assigned to the variables in the order they appear in the formula or in the data if no formula is used. Names of the split.select.weights vector are ignored. Weights assigned by split.select.weights to variables in always.split.variables are ignored. The usage of split.select.weights can increase the computation times for large forests.
> 
> Unordered factor covariates can be handled in 3 different ways by using respect.unordered.factors: For 'ignore' all factors are regarded ordered, for 'partition' all possible 2-partitions are considered for splitting. For 'order' and 2-class classification the factor levels are ordered by their proportion falling in the second class, for regression by their mean response, as described in Hastie et al. (2009), chapter 9.2.4. For multiclass classification the factor levels are ordered by the first principal component of the weighted covariance matrix of the contingency table (Coppersmith et al. 1999), for survival by the median survival (or the largest available quantile if the median is not available). The use of 'order' is recommended, as it computationally fast and can handle an unlimited number of factor levels. Note that the factors are only reordered once and not again in each split.
> 
> The 'impurity_corrected' importance measure is unbiased in terms of the number of categories and category frequencies and is almost as fast as the standard impurity importance. It is a modified version of the method by Sandri & Zuccolotto (2008), which is faster and more memory efficient. See Nembrini et al. (2018) for details. This importance measure can be combined with the methods to estimate p-values in importance_pvalues. We recommend not to use the 'impurity_corrected' importance when making predictions since the feature permutation step might reduce predictive performance (a warning is raised when predicting on new data).
> 
> Note that ranger has different default values than other packages. For example, our default for mtry is the square root of the number of variables for all tree types, whereas other packages use different values for regression. Also, changing one hyperparameter does not change other hyperparameters (where possible). For example, splitrule="extratrees" uses randomized splitting but does not disable bagging as in Geurts et al. (2006). To disable bagging, use replace = FALSE, sample.fraction = 1. This can also be used to grow a single decision tree without bagging and feature subsetting: ranger(..., num.trees = 1, mtry = p, replace = FALSE, sample.fraction = 1), where p is the number of independent variables.
> 
> While random forests are known for their robustness, default hyperparameters not always work well. For example, for high dimensional data, increasing the mtry value and the number of trees num.trees is recommended. For more details and recommendations, see Probst et al. (2019). To find the best hyperparameters, consider hyperparameter tuning with the tuneRanger or mlr3 packages.
> 
> Out-of-bag prediction error is calculated as accuracy (proportion of misclassified observations) for classification, as Brier score for probability estimation, as mean squared error (MSE) for regression and as one minus Harrell's C-index for survival. Harrell's C-index is calculated based on the sum of the cumulative hazard function (CHF) over all timepoints, i.e., rowSums(chf), where chf is the the out-of-bag CHF; for details, see Ishwaran et al. (2008). Calculation of the out-of-bag prediction error can be turned off with oob.error = FALSE.

> Regularization works by penalizing new variables by multiplying the splitting criterion by a factor, see Deng & Runger (2012) for details. If regularization.usedepth=TRUE, 
> f
> d
> f 
> d
>   is used, where f is the regularization factor and d the depth of the node. If regularization is used, multithreading is deactivated because all trees need access to the list of variables that are already included in the model.
> 
> Missing values can be internally handled by setting na.action = "na.learn" (default), by omitting observations with missing values with na.action = "na.omit" or by stopping if missing values are found with na.action = "na.fail". With na.action = "na.learn", missing values are ignored for calculating an initial split criterion value (i.e., decrease of impurity). Then for the best split, all missings are tried in both child nodes and the choice is made based again on the split criterion value. For prediction, this direction is saved as the "default" direction. If a missing occurs in prediction at a node where there is no default direction, it goes left.
> 
> For a large number of variables and data frames as input data the formula interface can be slow or impossible to use. Alternatively dependent.variable.name (and status.variable.name for survival) or x and y can be used. Use x and y with a matrix for x to avoid conversions and save memory. Consider setting save.memory = TRUE if you encounter memory problems for very large datasets, but be aware that this option slows down the tree growing.
> 
> For GWAS data consider combining ranger with the GenABEL package. See the Examples section below for a demonstration using Plink data. All SNPs in the GenABEL object will be used for splitting. To use only the SNPs without sex or other covariates from the phenotype file, use 0 on the right hand side of the formula. Note that missing values are treated as an extra category while splitting.
> 
> By default, ranger uses 2 threads. The default can be changed with: (1) num.threads in ranger/predict call, (2) environment variable R_RANGER_NUM_THREADS, (3) options(ranger.num.threads = N), (4) options(Ncpus = N), with precedence in that order.

> A reviewer has asked me:
> 
> "Finally, I would expect some descriptions of the model setup and training as commonly reported in the Machine Learning literature. Was the data split into train, validation, and test set? How was the performance evaluated (via RMSE?) and how did the performance change over trained epochs."

> How can I write up this description for my paper, and is there any information I should extract from the fitted RF to include in there?
**assistant**:
> To address the reviewer's request and provide a comprehensive description of your model setup and training process, you can structure your write-up as follows:
> 
> ### Model Setup and Training
> 
> 1. **Model Configuration**: 
>    - You have implemented a Random Forest model using the `ranger` package in R.
>    - The model was configured with `500` trees, a maximum depth of `12`, and other default settings. Specifically, a brief explanation could include:
>      - Number of trees (`num.trees`): 500, which helps stabilizing the model's predictions.
>      - Maximum depth (`max.depth`): 12, providing control over model complexity.
>      - The default mtry setting was used, which is typically set to the square root of the number of features for classification tasks.
> 
> 2. **Data Splitting**:
>    - Describe how you handled data partitioning if applicable. If you split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets, specify the proportion or number of samples allocated to each set. For example, you might have used an 80-10-10 split for training, validation, and testing, respectively.
>    - If you did not perform explicit splitting, explain that cross-validation techniques or out-of-bag (OOB) samples were used for assessing model performance.
> 
> 3. **Performance Evaluation**:
>    - Describe how you evaluated the model's performance. For regression problems, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the out-of-bag (OOB) error are common metrics. You can state:
>      - "We evaluated the model's performance using the out-of-bag (OOB) mean squared error (MSE) as provided by the `ranger` implementation, which is a robust estimator of model accuracy."
>      - "Additionally, we computed the RMSE to quantify the typical prediction error in the same units as the target variable."
> 
> 4. **Training Process**:
>    - Explain how the training was conducted with `ranger` and emphasize the fact that random forests do not use iterative training epochs like neural networks. Instead, the model performance is linked to the ability of the ensemble of decision trees to reduce error as more trees are added.
>    - Mention that the OOB error provides insights on the necessity of additional trees; stable or increasing OOB error suggests that the current number of trees is sufficient.
> 
> 5. **Model Outputs and Diagnostics**:
>    - You can include specific outputs derived from the `ranger` object as evidence of model performance:
>      - Report the OOB prediction error and any other relevant summary statistics, such as R-squared for regression tasks.
>      - If important for your context, discuss variable importance metrics, which indicate which predictors were most influential in the model.
> 
> By covering these areas, you should provide a clear and comprehensive description of your model setup and training process, fulfilling the reviewer's request with relevant details. Remember to adapt this structure if your specific situation involves other significant elements or choices in your modeling approach.

> 
> The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets in the following proportions: \textbf{Training: FILLIN\%, Validation: FILLIN\%, Test: FILLIN\%}. This partitioning allowed us to evaluate model performance on unseen data effectively. Additionally, we utilized cross-validation techniques to assess the model's reliability. 
> 
> \subsection{Performance Evaluation}
> 
> Model performance was evaluated using the out-of-bag (OOB) mean squared error (MSE) as provided by the \texttt{ranger} implementation. Furthermore, we computed the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify the typical prediction error in the original units of the target variable. The OOB prediction error was measured to be FILLIN, while the RMSE for the validation set was FILLIN.
> 
> \subsection{Training Process}
> 
> The training process resulted in a robust model, with no iterative training epochs as seen in neural networks. Instead, the model's performance is intrinsically linked to the ensemble of decision trees. Notably, the OOB error allowed us to ascertain the necessity of additional trees; a stable or increasing OOB error indicated that the current number of trees was sufficient.
> 
> \subsection{Model Outputs and Diagnostics}
> 
> The final model outputs included the OOB prediction error, which was FILLIN, alongside additional statistics such as R-squared for regression tasks, measured at FILLIN. We also examined variable importance metrics calculated from the fitted model, which provided insights into the most impactful predictors within the dataset.

**assistant**:
> If you didn't perform explicit data splitting, but still used the available dataset for fitting the trees, it’s important to clarify that in your write-up. Here’s how you can update the "Data Splitting" section to reflect that:
> 
> ```latex
> \subsection{Data Splitting}
> 
> No explicit data splitting was performed for the training of the Random Forest model. Instead, we leveraged the out-of-bag (OOB) samples generated during the bootstrapping process inherent to the Random Forest approach. This enabled us to assess model performance without the need for a separate validation or test set. The OOB mechanism provided an unbiased estimate of the model's predictive accuracy and allowed for effective evaluation of variable importance.

> You can insert this revised section into the LaTeX document, and it will clarify your approach while emphasizing the robustness of the OOB evaluation methods used in your modeling process.
