> ===
> Delaware Sea Grant College Program Strategic Plan
> February 1, 2024 through January 31, 2028.
> This strategic plan outlines the response of the Delaware Sea Grant College Program to the needs
> of Delaware’s coastal residents, communities, elected officials, businesses, and organizations. It
> was developed through a multiphase process, which was intended to engage and challenge staff
> and other interested parties to identify priority issues, objectives, and performance measures for
> functional work areas1
> . The goal of this process was to create an intuitive, user-friendly strategic
> plan that will guide the programmatic operations of Delaware Sea Grant from February 1, 2024
> through January 31, 2028. The following sections identify the program’s mission, vision, and
> core values, and outline priority issues and objectives for each functional work area, including
> cross cutting principles. Goals of the National Sea Grant College Program that will be addressed
> are also presented. Additional information regarding the Delaware Sea Grant College Program
> and the strategic planning process is included in Appendix A.
> PROGRAM MISSION
> The Delaware Sea Grant College Program was established in 1976 to promote the wise use,
> conservation, and management of Delaware’s coastal resources through an integrated program in
> research, extension, education, and outreach built upon active partnerships with state and federal
> agencies, the private sector, and people at large. To achieve this mandate, Delaware Sea Grant
> leverages federal and state funding to provide financial support to external partners for
> innovative research, community and economic development, and conservation projects. Our
> extension staff also lead hands-on projects, deliver workshops and trainings, develop balanced
> written assessments, and provide one-on-one consultations regarding a diverse array of issues
> pertaining to resilient communities and economies, healthy coastal ecosystems, sustainable
> fisheries and aquaculture, environmental literacy, and workforce development. Benefits of this
> work are provided to a broad suite of coastal residents, communities, elected officials,
> businesses, and organizations.
> PROGRAM VISION
> The vision of Delaware Sea Grant is to create and maintain a healthy coastal environment that
> supports thriving coastal communities and a robust coastal economy.
> CORE VALUES
> Delaware Sea Grant places a high value on the following principles:
> 
> 1 Functional work areas, or the broad areas within which Delaware Sea Grant operates, were used to structure the
> strategic plan, instead of the broader focus areas identified by the National Sea Grant Office, to make the document
> more intuitive and to facilitate easier tracking of progress towards the successful achievement of programmatic goals
> and objectives.

> ● The work of Delaware Sea Grant is informed by the needs of Delaware’s coastal
> residents, communities, elected officials, businesses, and organizations. Foundational
> questions for research, extension, education, and outreach include: (1) who needs this
> information, and (2) what change in action, behavior, or management may occur as a
> result of knowledge transfer.
> ● The work of Delaware Sea Grant provides benefits to a diverse suite of people
> broadly representative of the demographics of our state. This necessitates using an
> inclusive approach in project planning and implementation so that a diversity of views
> and opinions are considered and incorporated.
> ● The work of Delaware Sea Grant goes beyond defining problems or providing
> information; Delaware Sea Grant is a problem-solving and solutions-oriented
> organization.
> ● The integration of applied research and extension is critical to the success of our
> program.
> FUNCTIONAL WORK AREAS
> The Delaware Sea Grant College Program supports work across six functional areas, which
> generally correspond to the focus areas of the National Sea Grant College Program. The
> following table identifies priority issues that will be addressed for each:

> Page 3 of 30
> Delaware Sea Grant addresses priority issues through an integrated program in applied scientific
> research2
> , extension, education, and outreach3
> . Applied research helps our program advance
> understanding of Delaware’s coastal ecosystems, resources, management approaches, economy,
> and communities. This detailed and nuanced understanding of the physical, chemical, biological,
> and human dimensions of our coastal environment allows our program to craft innovative
> extension, education, and outreach programs that are intended to maintain a healthy coastal
> ecosystem that supports thriving coastal communities and a robust coastal economy. While the
> needs presented in this plan may appear to be focused separately on research, extension,
> education, and outreach, it is the integration of these different aspects that allows Delaware Sea
> Grant to have a positive impact in Delaware and the mid-Atlantic region. To this end, as this
> strategic plan is implemented, careful consideration will be given at every opportunity as to how
> research and extension activities can be integrated to address identified priority issues.
> CROSS CUTTING PRINCIPLES
> While priority issues and objectives are presented separately for each functional work area, there
> are four cross cutting principles that are found within each:
> 1. Adaptation to climate change
> 2. Volunteer engagement
> 3. Internal collaboration
> 4. Flexibility
> First, adaptation to climate change was identified as the key issue across all functional areas. It is
> abundantly clear that over this four-year period, the actions of Delaware Sea Grant must support
> measures to adapt to climate change, regardless of whether this is working with businesses,
> communities, or individuals. Issues that warrant support from Delaware Sea Grant include, for
> example, how to manage fisheries that are shifting in response to changing water temperatures;
> how to plan for anticipated changes in community flooding; and how marshes should be
> managed as sea levels rise and inundation increases, among many others. Accordingly, this
> overarching theme—adaptation to climate change—is a cross cutting principle that is present in
> each functional work area. It is anticipated that by focusing on this issue in many different
> places, and in many different ways, at the end of the four-year period, our state will be better
> prepared for anticipated future climate conditions.
> 
> 2 Consistent with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Administrative Order 216-115A,
> Delaware Sea Grant considers applied research to be “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new
> knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific, practical aim or objective. Applied research is
> undertaken either to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new methods or ways
> of achieving specific and predetermined objectives.” (NOAA Administrative Order 216-115A, issued 10/3/2016:
> https://www.corporateservices.noaa.gov/ames/administrative_orders/chapter_216/216-115A.html).
> 3 In accordance with Fundamentals of a Sea Grant Extension Program
> (http://nsglc.olemiss.edu/projects/advocacy/files/extension-fundamentals.pdf), the broad goal of extension,
> education, and outreach is to effect change by having individuals, groups, or institutions use science-based
> information. Delaware Sea Grant considers extension to be using research results to inform decision-making;
> education to be the teaching of Sea Grant and other relevant coastal and environmental information as part of a
> formal learning process (e.g., focused on K-16 students/teachers); and outreach to be education that occurs in a more
> informal setting (e.g., summer camps, festival exhibits).
> Page 4 of 30
> Volunteer engagement is the second cross cutting principle. Across all functional work areas,
> Delaware Sea Grant will seek to engage individuals and community organizations as volunteers,
> to the extent practicable, in all stages of work, including data collection, education, and outreach
> efforts. We believe that engaging people in our work will amplify the benefits. To this end,
> Delaware Sea Grant will follow standard protocols for volunteer engagement, and will seek to
> include community members in our work at every possible opportunity.
> Internal collaboration is the third cross cutting principle. While each functional work area is
> presented separately within this plan, there is significant overlap between them. For example,
> efforts to improve environmental literacy through education are ubiquitous, and are found in all
> functional work areas. Similarly, there is significant work, for example, that addresses both
> coastal ecology and fisheries, and resilience and economic development that blends the
> distinction between these functional areas. As such, it is anticipated that Delaware Sea Grant
> staff will collaborate extensively, though these collaborations are not expressly identified within
> this plan.
> Finally, flexibility is the fourth cross cutting principle. While this plan presents very specific,
> actionable objectives for each priority issue, it is anticipated that additional needs will arise and
> will be addressed by Delaware Sea Grant over the course of this work period.
> Keeping these cross-cutting principles in mind, the following sections identify the priority issues,
> and objectives for each of Delaware Sea Grant’s functional areas that will be addressed between
> February 1, 2024 and January 31, 2028.
> Note to Researchers: Specific research priorities are identified throughout this strategic plan,
> including research needs associated with climate change adaptation, exploration of the blue
> economy in Delaware, and ecosystem restoration. In addition to these, there are countless other
> opportunities to advance the objectives of Delaware Sea Grant through applied research, though
> these opportunities may not be explicitly identified. Researchers should carefully consider the
> priority issues and objectives identified within this strategic plan to identify areas where applied
> research will help address identified needs.

> COASTAL COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND PLANNING
> GOAL: Coastal communities have the capability and resources to prepare for and adapt to
> extreme and chronic weather and coastal hazards, climate change, economic disruptions and
> other threats to community health and well-being.
> 1. Resilience to Weather and Climate Hazards: Delaware has the lowest mean elevation in the
> United States and twice the global rate of sea level rise. Its flat, low-lying terrain makes it
> especially vulnerable to flooding, but it also has vulnerability to other weather and climate
> hazards. Delaware communities will need to implement a range of adaptation measures to
> address these challenges. There is a need to assist communities with resiliency planning
> through outreach, training, and technical assistance. Additional work is needed to assist our
> communities, to understand risk and specific constraints regarding risk, to develop successful
> climate adaptation strategies, and to advance understanding of potential obstacles and
> opportunities for adaptation, including unintended consequences.
> Rationale: In 2020 and 2021, Delaware had two federally declared disasters: a recordbreaking tornado north of Dover and widespread flooding in Wilmington from the
> remnants of Hurricane Ida. Climate change is causing more extreme events in our region
> and our current land use practices, population growth, and demographics are increasing
> population exposure and vulnerability to these hazards. More attention is needed to
> improve the resilience of our communities so they are better prepared to respond and
> recover from disasters. This includes defining what could and should a more resilient
> coastal Delaware look like and determining what practices, at what scale, will be needed
> to reach a target level of resilience. Additional research is needed in Delaware to fully
> contextualize and understand these issues and the constraints of our communities,
> specifically the human and social dimensions that influence the implementation and
> success of coastal adaptation strategies.
> Objective 1: Support research that seeks to advance understanding of the nuances associated
> with coastal resilience, and to develop measures that will help Delaware communities achieve
> resilience goals.
> Objective 2: Improve climate literacy and coastal resilience by educating the public about
> weather and climate hazards, including the underlying science, the difference between weather
> and climate, and the role of climate change in extreme events.
> Objective 3: Provide technical assistance to help individuals and communities undertake the
> necessary plans, policies, and strategies needed to adapt to climate change, manage weatherrelated risks, and improve emergency preparedness.
> Objective 4: Through the Delaware Sea Grant Coastal Resilience Design Studio, provide free
> conceptual design services for projects that will promote community resilience.
> Objective 5: Assist state and local authorities to equitably plan for the needs of vulnerable
> populations including older adults, before, during, and after emergencies.
> 2. Community Resilience in Wilmington: Urban coastal communities and businesses in
> Wilmington, Delaware need support to address a myriad of issues associated with changing
> coastal conditions. There is a need for resources and solutions that come from within the
> community and address the specific needs of the community.
> Page 6 of 30
> Rationale: The City of Wilmington, Delaware is located at the confluence of two tidal
> rivers; many city neighborhoods are vulnerable to increased precipitation, extreme storm
> events, flooding, and increased temperatures associated with climate change, which pose
> an increasing threat to communities and the city’s economy. Wilmington’s minority and
> low-income neighborhoods will be hardest hit. In both east and south Wilmington, where
> poverty rates are as high as 32%, substantial inundation is expected and adaptation
> measures will be needed. The Port of Wilmington, one of the biggest employers in the
> area, is also extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. An estimated 36 to 73% of the Port
> could be inundated by 2100. As such, there is an urgent need for support to address a
> myriad of issues associated with changing coastal conditions within Wilmington.
> Objective 1: Foster partnerships with communities, local governments, businesses, and other
> relevant organizations to begin to understand the issues pertinent to Delaware’s urban
> communities in Wilmington. These are likely to include access to safe greenspaces and the
> water, and development of natural infrastructure that provides valuable ecosystem services,
> such as evaporative cooling and infiltration of rainwater, which can help mitigate the impacts
> of urban heat islands and changing coastal conditions, among others. Develop a detailed
> understanding of community needs through applied research and extension and a strategy for
> Delaware Sea Grant to begin to provide support.
> 3. Capacity Building: There is a lack of capacity within communities to work on resilience
> planning, procurement of funds, project implementation, and long-term ownership and
> maintenance of coastal resilience projects. There is a distinct need to develop missing
> “institutional infrastructure,” expertise and processes that could help address this need.
> Rationale: More than two-thirds of Delaware’s municipalities can be characterized as
> mid-sized (5,000 to 10,000 people) or small (5,000 or under). Additionally, more
> Delaware residents live outside of incorporated areas than inside of them. This has
> profound implications for governance at the community level. Many Delaware towns
> lack staff, expertise, time, and resources to carry out the necessary planning to develop
> and execute projects that improve resilience to climate change, extreme weather, and
> other disruptive events such as economic recessions. In addition, the three counties in
> Delaware vary in size, structure, and the scope of services they provide. With increased
> funding anticipated for infrastructure and resilience in the near-term, capacity issues
> create a serious bottleneck.
> Objective 1: Continue to foster partnerships and networks that increase the capacity of
> Delaware communities to undertake resilience and adaptation planning.
> Objective 2: Initiate a community resilience survey with local municipal officials in Delaware
> to identify and inventory resilience challenges (environmental, economic, and social),
> including capacity needs that inhibit communities from successfully applying for funding and
> implementing resilience projects, in an effort to better understand perceived needs.
> Objective 3: Establish a list of ready-made community resilience projects for funding
> consideration and investigate new and alternative methods of project funding; assist with the
> development of funding procurement processes for municipalities.
> Objective 4: Develop a pipeline of institutional support that will provide assistance to
> communities through each phase of resiliency planning. The pipeline approach will outline 
> Page 7 of 30
> which partners can provide support at the different stages of a resilience project, from planning
> to design and implementation.
> 4. Sustainable Development: A surge in population growth over the past decades, combined
> with Delaware being identified as a favorable location to retire, is driving an abundance of
> land use changes within our state. There is a need to provide support to communities so these
> changes occur in a thoughtful and strategic fashion that enhance the local economy, minimize
> impact to existing natural resources, and promote resilience.
> Rationale: At the county level, Sussex County, Delaware has been put forward as an
> example of unfettered growth, with its population increasing nearly 20% between 2010
> and 2019; however, growth in certain portions of southern New Castle County and
> northern Kent County, Delaware, has exceeded the growth rates observed broadly in
> Sussex. Regardless of location, current land use practices promote development in the
> floodplain and along the coast, the loss of open space, and encroachment on wetlands and
> agricultural lands. This has resulted in development occurring in vulnerable areas in some
> instances; in others, development is negatively impacting or degrading natural resources,
> like coastal wetlands, which is reducing the capacity of natural systems to buffer the
> effects of changing coastal conditions and making new and existing communities more
> vulnerable to sea level rise, and severe coastal storms.
> Objective 1: Broadly share relevant information regarding development practices, associated
> vulnerabilities, and best practices that should be incorporated into new and existing
> communities with existing homeowners and potential homebuyers in coastal Delaware.
> Objective 2: Engage communities and associated organizations (e.g., county government,
> municipal planning commissions) in long-range land use planning that proactively anticipates
> and prepares for climate change, extreme events, and other megatrends (such as demographic
> shifts or changes in our economy). Factors to be considered include tolerance for routine
> flooding / inundation, the potential for some areas to become uninhabitable, and potential
> planning and zoning changes that may maintain thriving communities well into the future
> despite significant changes to the coast.
> Page 8 of 30
> ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
> GOAL: Water resources are enhanced, sustained and protected to meet existing and emerging
> needs of the communities and economies that depend on them.
> 1.Local Economic Development: There is a need to examine new and innovative ways to
> promote local economic development, resulting in long-term community changes, and to work
> directly with communities to identify available opportunities and programs, which could take
> advantage of significant increases in available federal and state funding.
> Rationale: Delaware’s communities are primed for economic development – in
> proximity to major markets in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., yet
> removed enough to maintain a unique charm. The state is also blessed with abundant
> natural resources and a favorable tax structure. However, many coastal communities are
> struggling to develop and implement strategies to attract business and promote downtown
> revitalization and development.
> Objective 1: Assess commercial, small-business growth capacity that capitalizes on existing
> coastal assets and resources in targeted coastal communities that are suffering from economic
> decline.
> Objective 2: Partner with community economic development entities (e.g. Sussex Economic
> Development Action Committee) to create, promote and/or retain new businesses utilizing
> government-funding mechanisms.
> 2.Working Waterfront Communities: There is a need to provide technical assistance to
> Delaware’s working waterfront communities4
> , which consist of a relatively small number of
> incorporated towns with limited staff capacity and a shared heritage of economic, physical,
> and social connections to Delaware’s waterways.
> Rationale: Many of Delaware’s working waterfront communities continue to experience
> significant economic and social decline due to the loss of commercial fishing and
> processing industries, while new growth and development pressures create decision
> points about the future trajectory of these communities. Example working waterfronts in
> Delaware include, Port Penn, Leipsic, Little Creek, Bowers Beach, Cedar Creek, Lewes,
> and Indian River. Building on prior assistance, there is an opportunity to continue
> providing technical assistance to these communities.
> Objective 1: Provide economic and community development assistance to working waterfront
> communities by: (1) designing and delivering training programs to help communities
> understand their physical, institutional, and economic environments and develop community
> action plans; (2) developing and hosting a resource bank of issues facing similar communities
> 
> 4 Consistent with the definition used by the National Working Waterfront Network, this strategic plan defines a
> working waterfront as a community that is adjacent to navigable waters that supports direct water-dependent private
> or public operations and activities that positively affect the economy of the surrounding community. Example
> operations include: commercial and recreational fishing, and associated facilities; aquaculture; seafood processing;
> marine transportation and shipping; port and harbor operations; boat building, sales, and repair; offshore renewable
> energy; offshore mineral harvesting; coastal tourism and water-based recreation; and other activities that require
> direct use and/or flow of coastal inland waters that necessitate direct use of the waterfront. Municipal water intake,
> usage, or delivery are not included in this definition.
> Page 9 of 30
> nationwide and successful rural development approaches these communities have used; and
> (3) providing professional technical assistance to guide communities in the implementation of
> economic and community development projects.
> 3. Diversity of the Coastal Economy: There is a need to augment the existing foundation of
> Delaware’s coastal economy, which is based on tourism and agriculture, with knowledge and
> innovation-based opportunities that grow the state’s blue and green economies in order to
> diversify the coast’s economic base, create a more equitable economy for individuals and
> communities, and address the fundamental causes of global climate change.
> Rationale: Both tourism and agriculture primarily support low-paying jobs that do not
> offer robust benefits (e.g., paid time off, health insurance, retirement planning); this has
> resulted in an inequitable economy for much of coastal Delaware with the people that
> support these two industries often struggling financially. Supporting a new knowledge
> and innovation-based economy will bring new money into the state, potentially creating
> better employment opportunities for existing and new residents. Delaware’s unique
> geographic position, in close proximity to both Philadelphia and Washington, DC,
> coupled with the emergence of remote work, put Delaware’s coastal communities in a
> unique position to attract professional talent that can help facilitate the growth of a new
> economic sector. Within our state, there is a need to specifically define opportunities and
> obstacles. For example, what could and should be part of the blue and green economies in
> Delaware? Does it include offshore energy generation? Innovation in converting the
> power grid of the state and country? Leadership in the development of carbon capture
> techniques? What assets does Delaware have that could position it to capitalize on
> emerging opportunities? Research and extension efforts need to focus on articulating a
> potential path forward for developing a robust and thriving blue and green economy in
> our state.
> Objective 1: Explore the potential for development of knowledge and innovation-based
> opportunities and technologies that grow the state’s blue and green economies through applied
> research and extension.
> Page 10 of 30
> HEALTHY COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS
> GOAL: Coastal habitats, ecosystems and the services they provide are protected,
> enhanced and/or restored.
> GOAL: Land, water, and living resources are managed by applying science, tools and
> services to sustain resilient coastal ecosystems.
> 1.Marine Debris: Marine debris, including derelict fishing gear (e.g., crab pots) and postconsumer waste, is a ubiquitous problem both globally and within Delaware’s waterways. Due
> to the prevalence and magnitude of the issue, there is a need to support efforts focused on
> prevention, interception, removal, and disposal of marine debris through research, extension,
> outreach, education, and the development of infrastructure at the community level.
> Rationale: Marine debris includes everything from lost fishing gear to fast food
> containers and household waste; it is essentially any man-made material that is found in
> coastal waters and oceans. Marine debris reaches coastal waters through a number of
> pathways, including misuse, improper disposal, and catastrophic loss during storms (in
> the case of boats that are lost during large storm events, for example). Regardless of the
> material or pathway, marine debris has far-reaching effects on the coastal environment
> and even the deep sea, and warrants additional attention. Within Delaware, derelict
> fishing gear is of particular concern, and has not been adequately addressed to date.
> Objective 1: Support research and perform education events focused on marine debris,
> including best approaches to reduce the loss of recreational and/or commercial fishing gear and
> other forms of marine debris.
> Objective 2: Continue the direct removal of derelict fishing gear from Delaware’s estuaries by
> Delaware Sea Grant, in collaboration with partner organizations, regulatory agencies,
> volunteers, and students.
> Objective 3: Develop the infrastructure to facilitate the future removal of derelict crab pots by
> others, including volunteers, in a systematic and productive fashion.
> Objective 4: Provide information and expert analysis to policy makers and regulators about
> derelict fishing gear and other forms of marine debris to facilitate the creation and
> implementation of improved management.
> 1.Marine Plastics: Plastics, a specific form of marine debris that warrants special attention, are
> a rapidly growing segment of municipal solid waste, with containers and packaging, including
> plastic bottles, single-use containers, bags, and wraps, constituting the largest proportion. A
> significant amount of this plastic waste reaches coastal waters due to littering, dumping, loss in
> transportation to landfills, and loss from landfills themselves. There is a need to both broadly
> educate the general public about ways that the overall consumption of disposable plastics
> could be reduced and to work with specific target audiences to reduce the use of disposable
> plastics in specific sectors (e.g., the restaurant industry) and to improve post-consumer
> management.
> Rationale: The accumulation of plastics in our waterways, along the coast, and in the
> ocean is a concern at multiple levels. For example, plastic waste has the potential to leach
> chemicals that may impact ecological and human health; it also results in mortality in 
> Page 11 of 30
> avifauna, marine mammals, and fish through ingestion and entanglement. Addressing
> these effects requires a multifaceted approach focused on reduced use of disposable and
> single-use plastics, as well as targeted efforts to improve post-consumer management.
> Objective 1: Broadly share relevant information regarding the potential impacts of plastic
> waste on coastal and marine ecosystems along with practices that consumers may use to
> reduce their consumption of disposable and single use plastics with people in Delaware,
> including elected officials at multiple levels of government.
> Objective 2: Develop a strategy with collaborating partners to reduce the amount of plastic
> waste reaching Delaware’s coastal waters by both working to reduce the amount of disposable
> and single use plastics being used in different sectors and by improving the management and
> disposal of post-consumer waste.
> 2. Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs): Emerging contaminants, such as per- and
> polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals, and microplastics, have increasingly
> been documented in coastal ecosystems around the world, including in Delaware. Currently,
> there is a limited understanding regarding the prevalence, distribution, and potential effects of
> CECs. Through research and extension there is an opportunity for Delaware Sea Grant to play
> a role as new information becomes available and understanding and management strategies
> evolve.
> Rationale: A regional project, led by Connecticut Sea Grant, developed a national
> framework to guide Sea Grant’s involvement with CECs. This framework identified
> several opportunities for engagement, including connecting various people and
> organizations (e.g., researchers, regulators, resource users, and the public), developing a
> connection between ecosystem effects and people, and addressing community needs,
> including those of communities that may be disproportionately impacted by CECs.
> Objective 1: Support research and provide extension and education services that increase
> awareness of CECs in Delaware’s estuaries, including information regarding distribution,
> prevalence, and potential effects.
> 3.Working Estuary Restoration5: These is a need to understand the ecological value of
> industrial portions of the Delaware Estuary, north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, to
> articulate this value to adjacent communities and businesses, and to undertake intentional
> efforts to restore this section of the estuary.
> Rationale: The extent of the Delaware Estuary located within northern New Castle
> County, Delaware has been impacted by a dense human population and a legacy of
> historical and on-going industrial and chemical manufacturing and shipping uses. Public
> perception of this reach is poor, despite its ecological significance, and efforts solely
> focused on restoring this portion of the estuary and reestablishing an intimate connection
> between the water and residents within the adjacent coastal city of Wilmington, Delaware
> have lagged behind efforts undertaken in other areas.
> 
> 5 Restore America’s Estuaries defines a “working” estuary as an estuary that supports industrial and commercial
> activity, like manufacturing, marine transportation, and oil and gas production, as well as other uses, such as
> commercial and recreational fisheries, that rely on the health of the ecosystem for their continued existence. 
> Page 12 of 30
> Objective 1: Foster partnerships with communities, local governments, businesses, and other
> relevant organizations to begin to understand existing work and opportunities. Develop a
> strategy for Delaware Sea Grant to begin to provide support. Evaluate similar programs in
> other states that have focused on industrial waterways, for example the Elizabeth River
> Project in Virginia.
> 4.Loss of Habitat and Ecosystem Function: Habitat loss—including historical losses in
> industrial portions of the Delaware Estuary, continued losses due to on-going development and
> land use change throughout the estuary, and future losses of habitat due to climate change and
> its associated effects—is a pressing concern that impacts the resilience of our state’s natural
> and human communities.
> Rationale: Historically, the Delaware Estuary supported expansive oyster reefs, tidal
> marshes, and a mosaic of coastal grassland and forested habitats. However, over the past
> several centuries, the estuary has been subject to substantial habitat alteration and loss,
> primarily due to human disturbance. As a result, stable, resilient coastal ecosystems that
> feature a range of intact habitats are increasingly rare, which has made coastal areas and
> communities vulnerable to the effects of weather hazards and climate change. Today,
> human and environmental influences continue to threaten coastal habitats, including
> riparian areas, estuarine marshes, mudflats, and near-shore submerged aquatic vegetation.
> The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control cites
> residential development as the leading cause of coastal habitat loss in the state, either
> through direct conversion to building sites, lawns, or roadways in areas not protected by
> existing regulations, or conversion of natural shorelines to bulkheads and other forms of
> armoring. Indirect effects like increased flooding of coastal habitats due to runoff and
> prolonged submergence of nearshore habitats also have detrimental effects. These
> impacts are further exacerbated by climate change. Rising sea levels and increasingly
> frequent and intense coastal storms are submerging and eroding many coastal habitats,
> which contributes to poor water quality, sequesters less carbon, and provides less flood
> protection for neighboring communities. Addressing these challenges, and restoring
> ecosystems and the services that they provide is therefore of utmost importance.
> Objective 1: Support efforts to restore coastal ecosystems and associated services by funding
> applied research focused on improving restoration approaches.
> Objective 2: Engage with partner organizations to actively restore coastal habitats,
> ecosystems, and the services that they provide. This may include designing, permitting, and
> constructing riparian buffers, living shorelines, and intertidal and subtidal oyster reefs.
> 5. Nutrient and Sediment Pollution: There is a need to support efforts to both monitor and
> improve water quality throughout Delaware’s coastal waterways.
> Rationale: Water quality affects habitat, fisheries, and recreational use as well as a
> plethora of other activities, and is of significant concern in Delaware. In particular factors
> contributing to eutrophication (i.e., excess sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous), need to
> be monitored and addressed throughout the state.
> Objective 1: Employ an existing network of community volunteers to collect and analyze
> coastal water samples using quality assessment/quality control (QA/QC) standards; data will 
> Page 13 of 30
> be shared with state regulators and resource managers to support reporting needs and
> implementation of water quality improvement measures.
> Page 14 of 30
> SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE
> GOAL: Domestic fisheries, aquaculture and other coastal and freshwater living resources supply
> food, jobs and economic and cultural benefits.
> GOAL: Natural resources are sustainably managed to support coastal communities and working
> waterfronts, including commercial, recreational, subsistence fisheries and aquaculture.
> 1.Economic Growth of Aquaculture: There is a need to increase the economic resilience of the
> Delaware aquaculture industry by developing new businesses associated with shellfish
> farming, and expanding the diversity of our aquaculture and fisheries industries through the
> cultivation of new species/organisms.
> Rationale: While currently small, the commercial oyster aquaculture industry in
> Delaware, both within the Delaware Inland Bays (cage culture) and in the Delaware Bay
> (wild harvest / bottom culture), is growing and is anticipated to someday rival that of
> similarly sized states, like Rhode Island. There, shellfish aquaculture supports over 200
> aquaculture-related jobs and generates $6 million in annual revenue, which presents a
> reasonable target for the future growth of the industry within the Delaware. However, a
> substantial amount of work is needed to grow the Delaware industry from its current size
> to its full potential.
> Objective 1: Operate an Eastern Oyster hatchery at the University of Delaware Hugh R. Sharp
> Campus in Lewes, Delaware to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of a
> Delaware-based hatchery.
> Objective 2: Produce eyed larvae for remote setting to support the Delaware wild harvest
> oyster industry, and single seed larvae to support the Delaware Inland Bays caged oyster
> aquaculture industry.
> Objective 3: Lead informal educational opportunities focused on grow-out methodologies
> associated with Eastern Oyster cage-based aquaculture methods, as well as mortality,
> biofouling, and aquatic community level impacts to biodiversity associated with oyster
> farming.
> Objective 4: Host regular shellfish forums where information can be shared regarding
> challenges to industry growth, sustainable considerations to enhance economic output in
> shellfish aquaculture, and other relevant topics.
> Objective 5: Diversify the species cultured in the Delaware aquaculture industry by evaluating
> the aquaculture potential of new species or groups of organisms, for example kelp, mussels,
> ornamental fishes etc., for use in the state.
> 2. Aquaculture Ecosystem Services: Shellfish aquaculture provides ancillary benefits that can
> buffer the effects of coastal storms, improve water quality, and provide structural habitat for
> other fishes. There is a need to examine these interactions. Understanding these additional
> benefits and strategically aligning aquaculture efforts with ecosystem services and habitat
> restoration will further amplify the value of the fishery.
> Rationale: Throughout Delaware, stable, resilient coastal ecosystems that feature intact
> shellfish reefs are rare, which has made shorelines especially vulnerable to the erosive
> effects of climate change and sea level rise. To address these concerns, efforts are being 
> Page 15 of 30
> made throughout the state to stabilize eroding shorelines using nature-based solutions,
> which typically incorporate minimal structural elements with native vegetation and
> shellfish that, in combination, are intended to address erosion by protecting, restoring,
> and/or enhancing natural coastal functions and processes. Shellfish used in commercial
> aquaculture enterprises provide many similar benefits. Despite clear synergies between
> these enterprises, efforts to integrate shoreline restoration and shellfish aquaculture have
> been lacking. Understanding these additional benefits and strategically aligning
> aquaculture efforts with ecosystem restoration will further amplify the value of the
> fishery.
> Objective 1: Evaluate the impacts of current shellfish aquaculture practices on local aquatic
> communities and water quality, and potentially how these ecosystems services could be
> monetized. Share findings with coastal residents, policy makers, regulators, and other
> interested parties.
> 3. Resource-User Conflicts: There is a need for an unbiased broker to facilitate conversations
> between multiple users of the same resource to address potential conflicts, whether these are
> between commercial and recreational fishers, fishers and offshore energy development
> interests, aquaculture growers, or surf fishers. There is a concurrent need to understand how
> anthropogenic change may affect natural resources, including threatened and endangered
> species, and to communicate these findings to resource managers.
> Rationale: Conflicts between resource users are a challenge that is likely going to
> become further exacerbated as fisheries shift in response to climate change, shipping
> within the Delaware Estuary expands with further growth of the Port of Wilmington, and
> offshore energy development continues to advance. As a well-respected, unbiased broker
> in the state, Delaware Sea Grant is well-positioned to help navigate potential conflicts by
> participating in conversations between multiple resource users and performing and
> sharing applied research.
> Objective 1: Serve as a scientific liaison for planning groups that may include state
> government, industry, and communities, on challenging topics such as offshore wind
> development, fisheries response to climate change, and fish passage.
> Objective 2: Support applied research to investigate potential impacts of anthropogenic
> disturbance, ecologically significant species (e.g., horseshoe crabs), and mechanistic
> relationships; share findings with resource managers to inform decision-making.
> 4. Recreational Fishing: Given the magnitude of the recreational fishing industry in Delaware,
> there is a need for engagement on the management of recreational fish stocks, and with fishers
> to encourage best practices.
> Rationale: Recreational fishing in coastal Delaware is a significant industry that engages
> both residents and visitors. It is estimated that each year, approximately 93,000
> recreational fishing licenses are issued. Given the magnitude of the industry, and its
> impact on coastal resources, there is an opportunity for Delaware Sea Grant to positively
> engage with recreational fishers and resource managers to improve conditions. 
> Page 16 of 30
> Objective 1: Provide unbiased expert analysis that will assist in the management of
> recreational fishing resources.
> Page 17 of 30
> ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY
> GOAL: A diverse, environmentally literate public participates in lifelong formal and nonformal
> learning opportunities.
> 1. Responsive Programming: There is need to be responsive to the needs of individual
> educators, schools, and partners throughout the state of Delaware, and to use the resources
> available to Delaware Sea Grant to create and deliver programs that broadly advance
> Environmental and Ocean Literacy6 while meeting the learning objectives and curriculum
> goals of individuals and partner organizations.
> Rationale: Historically, a diverse suite of individuals and organizations have approached
> Delaware Sea Grant with specific requests for educational programming, lessons, and
> resources. These have ranged from K-12 teachers to the Boy Scouts of America to
> Wilmington youth programs. Being flexible and responsive has allowed our program to
> address these needs while broadly advancing environmental and ocean literacy in our
> state; continuing to do so is paramount to supporting a diverse, environmentally literate
> public.
> Objective 1: Provide education programming to K-12 students regarding coastal and marine
> science, renewable energy, climate change, aquaculture, and other areas related to the mission
> of Delaware Sea Grant independently, and/or in partnership with other Delaware informal
> education providers.
> Objective 2: Prepare and deliver educational materials, including classroom supports (e.g.
> lesson plans, classroom activities, data visualizations, educational media, etc.), for K-12
> students to audiences across the state via workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and
> meetings. These resources will focus on coastal and marine science, renewable energy, marine
> debris, emergency preparedness, climate change, aquaculture and other identified areas.
> 2.Teacher Professional Development: There is a need to better engage with teachers from
> around the state in order to provide them with high quality professional development that
> supports their classroom instruction and state education standards, such as the Next Generation
> Science Standards.
> Rationale: Data indicate that there is a significant challenge in Delaware in engaging
> teachers in professional development opportunities outside of those provided by their
> school and/or district.
> Objective 1: Provide broad professional development opportunities annually for K-12
> teachers and informal science educators in areas such as coastal and marine science, renewable
> energy, climate change, aquaculture, and marine careers.
> 3.Principles of Environmental and Ocean Literacy: There is a need to have a better trained
> community of formal educators, informal educators, and outreach and extension staff that can
> infuse the Essential Principles And Fundamental Concepts Of Ocean Science and
> Environmental Literacy into their work.
> 
> 6 The efforts of Delaware Sea Grant will advance the Delaware Environmental Literacy Plan and the Sea Grant
> Environmental Literacy Vision. Principles of Ocean Literacy are clearly defined by the Ocean Literacy Network.
> Page 18 of 30
> Rationale: In addition to supporting environmental and ocean literacy broadly, there is a
> need to raise awareness of specific environmental and ocean literacy principles/concepts
> to current and future educators (both formal and non-formal), so that those educators can
> deliver the common, shared messages (i.e., the core principles) to their respective
> audiences. Common messaging heard from multiple sources supports content
> reinforcement, which leads to better understanding and potentially improved decisionmaking.
> Objective 1: Provide focused professional development opportunities annually on Ocean
> Literacy and Environmental Literacy to teachers, informal educators, pre-service teachers,
> school administrators, faculty, college students and the general public.
> 4.Mobile Teaching Lab: There is a need to develop mobile immersive teaching experiences
> that can be administered at different schools and venues throughout the state.
> Rationale: School districts and K-12 teachers are increasingly challenged to support
> transportation to external sites, and to find time within the curriculum for full-day
> immersive programs. However, there is a great need for hands-on educational
> opportunities that compliment curriculum. This potentially creates an opportunity to
> engage students and teachers in an immersive mobile lab experience.
> Objective 1: Investigate the feasibility and pilot a mobile teaching lab.
> Page 19 of 30
> WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
> GOAL: A diverse, skilled and environmentally literate workforce that is engaged and
> able to build prosperous lives and livelihoods in a changing world through traditional and
> innovative careers.
> 1. Career Exposure: There is a need to share information about environmental and marine
> careers so that students and early career professionals are aware of the range of career paths
> that support the needs of Delaware’s coastal communities, including industrial and technical
> positions, engineering, resource management, etc.
> Rationale: Basic awareness of the multitude of environment-related careers evades most
> Delaware students. Given even cursory exposure to the kinds of careers that exist in
> marine and environmental science, as early as elementary school and as late as technical
> and 4-year colleges and graduate school, can provide students with the information they
> need to pursue well-paying, lifelong jobs that are critical to the protection, restoration,
> and enhancement of our natural resources.
> Objective 1: Engage middle schools, high schools, and community colleges across Delaware
> in environmental and marine career exposure programs in fields such as renewable energy,
> robotics, fisheries, and aquaculture.
> Objective 2: Prepare environmental and marine career resources (e.g. fact sheets, activities,
> media) for middle and high school students as well as two- and four-year college students on
> topics such as renewable energy, robotics, fisheries and aquaculture, and other identified fields
> of study.
> 2. Career and Technical Education: There is a need to provide Career and Technical Education
> (CTE7
> ) programs that help students, early career professionals, and current workers develop
> skills that lead to careers that support the current and emerging needs of Delaware’s coastal
> communities.
> Rationale: As the state with the lowest mean elevation in the country, Delaware needs to
> be at the forefront of developing solutions to the challenges presented by changing
> coastal conditions. This includes addressing the root cause of climate change by
> supporting the development of renewable sources of energy, performing innovative
> research to understand future challenges, designing and constructing new forms of
> infrastructure, and restoring degraded habitats to buoy resilience of adjacent
> communities, all of which require a skilled workforce capable of succeeding in traditional
> and innovative careers.
> Objective 1: Support graduate student research, education, and professional development by
> providing funding for student tuition and stipends through our competitive research program
> and semi-annual workshops focused on teaching career skills.
> Objective 2: Support part-time and seasonal professional development internship
> opportunities for high school students, undergraduates, and/or graduate students.
> 
> 7 The National Center for Education Statistics defines Career and Technical Education as, “courses (at the high
> school level) and programs (at the postsecondary subbaccalaureate level) that focus on the skills and knowledge
> required for specific jobs or fields of work.”
> Page 20 of 30
> Objective 3: Continue to work with the Delaware Technical Community College to offer an
> innovative internship program that teaches green infrastructure design and construction skills
> to DelTech students through hands-on projects.
> Objective 4: Offer a certification program in green infrastructure design for early career
> professionals and current workers that will focus on teaching marketable skills that enhance
> the career prospects of participants.

> APPENDIX A
> Background Information and Overview of
> Strategic Planning Process
> THE DELAWARE SEA GRANT COLLEGE PROGRAM
> Delaware Sea Grant is administered by the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment at the
> University of Delaware, which was designated as the nation’s ninth Sea Grant College in 1976.
> The program was initially tasked with revitalizing a decimated Delaware Bay oyster industry, but
> has evolved over time as conditions within Delaware’s coastal environment, and associated
> needs, have changed.
> Delaware’s Geography and Demographics
> Delaware lies along the Atlantic coast of the United States, occupying the northeastern twothirds of the Delmarva Peninsula. Delaware features 381 miles of tidal shoreline, including 24
> miles of ocean coastline, and approximately 90,000 acres of tidal wetlands. It is bordered by the
> Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Estuary to the east, and Maryland’s Eastern Shore and the
> Chesapeake Bay to the west. Delaware has the lowest mean elevation of any state in the country,
> and no point in the state is farther than eight miles from a tidal waterbody. Both the Delaware
> Estuary and the Delaware Inland Bays, which are located in the southern portion of the state,
> have been designated National Estuary Programs. The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which
> connects Chesapeake Bay with Delaware Bay, is also an important asset to the nation’s
> commerce, carrying not only recreational boaters, but also commercial vessels navigating
> between the busy ports of Baltimore, Wilmington (Delaware), and Philadelphia. The Port of
> Wilmington itself is a significant economic resource; it has the largest dock-side cold storage
> facility in the country and leads the nation for imports of fresh fruit and juice concentrate.
> Delaware is also densely populated; with only three counties and a land area of 1,982 square
> miles, Delaware is home to approximately 485 people per square mile – sixth most in the United
> States - which is anticipated to grow 22 percent over the next 30 years. Demographics are also
> shifting, with an increasing proportion of retirees, estimated as a 2.6% increase in the population
> that is 65 and older.
> Challenges and Emerging Concerns
> Population growth and associated development, significant commercial and industrial
> investments in the state, a $3.3 billion tourism economy, and the predominance of agriculture
> over much of the land area all affect our coastal environment, resources, and communities.
> Changing coastal conditions are also having an impact and will continue to in the future.
> The Approach of Delaware Sea Grant
> Delaware Sea Grant has been at the forefront of addressing these concerns throughout the state
> for more than 45 years. Our program provides scientific information and hands-on guidance to
> the public, industry, and government on issues related to our coastal environment, resources,
> economy, and communities. 
> Page 22 of 30
> To do so, Delaware Sea Grant invests in applied scientific research, and extension, education,
> and outreach efforts. Applied research is performed by external partners and increasingly
> Delaware Sea Grant staff. Much of the extension, education, and outreach work is performed by
> our Marine Advisory Service, which includes staff with expertise in diverse fields, such as
> coastal hazards, economic development, fisheries, coastal ecology, and water quality. Our team
> has provided one-on-one consultations, prepared and delivered workshops and trainings, and
> provided balanced written assessments and white papers regarding a diverse array of coastal
> issues. Throughout these efforts, our team has strived to serve as an unbiased source of
> information to support the needs of our coastal residents, communities, businesses, and
> organizations.
> The size of Delaware, which is the second smallest state in the nation, has allowed our staff to
> form meaningful connections throughout the state. The majority of our staff are housed at the
> University of Delaware Hugh R. Sharp Campus in Lewes, Delaware, which is in proximity to the
> southern portion of the Delaware coast. We also have staff situated at Delaware State University
> in Dover, Delaware, which is in the geographic center of the state, through a joint appointment
> with the Delaware State University Cooperative Extension Program, and an increasing number
> of staff located at the main campus of the University of Delaware, in Newark, which is in the
> northern portion of the state.
> Partnerships
> Delaware Sea Grant works closely with a number of partners both regionally and within the
> state. This includes federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
> and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; other Sea Grant programs in the mid-Atlantic (and more
> broadly across the Sea Grant network); state agencies and organizations like the Delaware
> Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the Delaware National Estuarine
> Research Reserve, the two National Estuary Programs in Delaware; academic institutions across
> the state; and a number of industry and non-profit organizations.
> In addition to these broader partnerships, Delaware Sea Grant staff have also been instrumental
> in forming and/or leading three additional partner organizations that are critical to our
> organization: the University of Delaware Sustainable Coastal Communities Initiative, the
> Delaware Sea Grant Coastal Resilience Design Studio, and the Resilient and Sustainable
> Communities League.
> The Sustainable Coastal Communities Initiative is a unit within the University of Delaware that
> leverages existing expertise within the state to help analyze and offer solutions to the issues and
> challenges facing coastal communities to help them achieve their sustainable development goals.
> The Coastal Communities Specialist on the Delaware Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service has a
> joint appointment as Director of the Sustainable Coastal Communities Initiative. This allows our
> program to leverage resources and amplify the benefits of our work.
> Similarly, the Delaware Sea Grant Coastal Resilience Design Studio is a partnership between
> Delaware Sea Grant and University faculty in landscape architecture, which provides
> undergraduate and graduate students from academic institutions across Delaware with a handson, community-engaged learning experience. Using this approach, diverse, interdisciplinary 
> Page 23 of 30
> student teams work to provides real-world solutions to many of the pressing challenges facing
> Delaware’s coastal communities, primarily focusing on issues associated with resilience and
> economic development. Delaware Sea Grant provides the core funding for this program, serves
> on its leadership team, and provides technical project support.
> Finally, the Resilient and Sustainable Communities League (RASCL) was co-founded by the
> Delaware Sea Grant Coastal Hazards Specialist. RASCL is a collaborative network of state,
> nonprofit, and academic partners working to create a more resilient, sustainable Delaware.
> Members include Delaware state agencies, non-profit organizations, and communities.
> It is important to note that it is through these partnerships—both with external organizations and
> with organizations that are more directly connected to Delaware Sea Grant—that our program
> has been able to achieve many of our accomplishments.
> Program Finances
> Today (2022), Delaware Sea Grant manages approximately $2.3 million in combined federal and
> state funding. In addition, the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment at the University of
> Delaware has historically contributed funding to our program each year; these funds have been
> used to support approximately 20% of the Delaware Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service staff
> salaries. Contributions from these funding sources have evolved over time, and are anticipated to
> continue to do so as financial opportunities and challenges arise. It is anticipated that the work
> and obligations of Delaware Sea Grant will continue to evolve as a result.
> As a member of the National Sea Grant College Program, Delaware Sea Grant is required to
> invest between 30% and 50% of the program’s core funding in applied research. Dedicated
> research funding supports independent investigation by qualified researchers, as well as
> opportunities for associated graduate student education. The remainder of our funding supports
> extension, education, and outreach efforts, including the work of our staff and work performed
> by partner organizations.
> STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS
> The work of Delaware Sea Grant is guided by our strategic plan, which is intended to provide a
> path for our program to address the needs of Delaware’s coastal residents, communities, elected
> officials, businesses, and organizations. Delaware Sea Grant also operates under the guidelines
> of the National Sea Grant College Program, which is part of the National Oceanic and
> Atmospheric Administration within the U.S. Department of Commerce. Development of this
> strategic plan therefore focused on identifying needs in Delaware, and aligning programmatic
> operations to address those needs with the elements required by the National Sea Grant College
> Program.
> Strategic planning began by having our staff reflect and identify what they perceive to be the
> most important issues for their functional work areas (e.g., economic development; sustainable
> fisheries and aquaculture, etc.). This was a logical starting point since Delaware Sea Grant staff
> have a wealth of experience and come from diverse backgrounds working with federal and state
> agencies, non-profit organizations, industry, and academia. They also have connections to coastal
> residents, communities, elected officials, businesses, and organizations throughout the state and 
> Page 24 of 30
> have the benefit of routine communications with them.
> Concurrent with this effort, members of the Delaware Sea Grant management team participated
> in facilitated interviews with key people across functional work areas. An outside consulting
> firm, Bridgewater Education Consulting, LLC, guided these discussions. A diverse suite of
> people were consulted, which included partners that work closely with Delaware Sea Grant staff,
> members of the Delaware Sea Grant Advisory Council, and those with limited connections to and
> understanding of our organization and operations. The intent of engaging such a broad range of
> people was to verify staff-identified priority issues, and to identify important issues of which our
> staff might not be aware. The people that were consulted and guiding discussion questions are
> included in Attachment A.
> Following the interview process, members of the Delaware Sea Grant management team worked
> with staff to reconcile staff-derived priority issues with issues identified by those external to our
> organization. Associated objectives were developed through these discussions. Performance
> measures that document progress towards successful achievement of objectives were also
> created.
> The final list of priority issues and objectives for each functional work area were then shared
> with the Delaware Sea Grant Advisory Council to solicit one additional round of feedback.
> Comments were addressed as needed. The following table presents alignment with the
> performance measures and metrics of the National Sea Grant College Program.

> Vision for the Coastal Barometer
> 
> The Coastal Barometer is conceived as a transformative tool designed to capture and convey the dynamic health of the coastal economy. Subject to a range of economic risks and opportunities, the coastal economy’s infrastructure and assets face vulnerabilities such as flooding and sea-level rise, while sectors like tourism experience shifts induced by changing consumer behaviors. Concurrently, the natural environment navigates threats from multifaceted environmental change. Yet, these challenges also unveil significant economic opportunities, driven by rising appreciation for natural beauty and the evolving needs of an aging population.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer aims to provide a comprehensive dashboard of regularly updated data, reflecting the coastal economy’s overall health. It will support strategic planning, informed land-use decisions, and accurate forecasting of developmental impacts by reporting both an overarching economic and environmental health measure, supplemented by diverse indicators. These indicators will cover direct and indirect economic outputs, climate and other environmental risks, and gauges of economic resilience.
> 
> By leveraging methodologies inherent in sustainable development and inclusive accounting, the Coastal Barometer will illuminate the intricate interplay between the coastal economy and broader state and national economic frameworks. This integrative approach not only captures the immediate state of economic health but also signals opportunities for growth and resilience.
> 
> The Coastal Barometer is more than a statistical tool; it is a pathway to deeper economic insight. By simplifying access to this vital information, it empowers coastal community leaders to make more informed decisions about infrastructure investments and land-use planning. The tool also enables planners to accurately anticipate the impacts of new developments, aligning them with sustainable and inclusive growth objectives.
> 
> Envisioned as a critical instrument for Delaware’s coasts, the Coastal Barometer will initially be released in its foundational version, with future iterations expanding its scope and utility based on stakeholder feedback. Ultimately, it will serve not only as a monitoring device but as a guiding force for sustainable economic development, cementing its role as a cornerstone of enduring prosperity.
