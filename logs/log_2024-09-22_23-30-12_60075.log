**assistant**:
> In 17th century England, a "rector" was typically the clergyman in charge of a parish. The role of the rector was to oversee the spiritual and often the temporal welfare of the parish community. They were responsible for conducting religious services, administering sacraments, and providing pastoral care to their congregation. 
> 
> Rectors were often provided with a "living," or a benefice, which included income derived from either tithes (a portion of the parish's agricultural produce) or land. This income was meant to support them in performing their duties. The position of rector was often a respected and influential one within the community, and they sometimes had responsibilities related to local education and charity as well.
