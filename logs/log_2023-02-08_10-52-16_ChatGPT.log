> Where can I find a good tutorial on running GTAP?
**assistant**:
> The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) is an economic model used for policy analysis and research. A good place to start learning about running GTAP is the official GTAP website: https://gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/. The website provides a wealth of information including a user manual, training courses, and a series of tutorials. Additionally, there are several research papers and articles that explain the use of GTAP in detail. You can also search for online forums and discussion groups where GTAP users share their experiences and provide guidance on running the model.

> Can I run GTAP on a mac?
**assistant**:
> Yes, you can run GTAP on a Mac. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) is platform-independent, so it can be run on any operating system, including macOS. The GTAP model is implemented in the GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) software, which can be installed on a Mac. You can obtain the GAMS software and the necessary GTAP data sets from the official GTAP website: https://gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/. Once you have installed GAMS, you can run the GTAP model by using the appropriate GAMS code, which is provided on the GTAP website.
**user**:
> It appears that GTAP uses GEMPACK, not GAMS. Are these related?
**assistant**:
> Yes, GEMPACK and GAMS are related but distinct software systems. GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical programming and optimization, while GEMPACK (General Equilibrium Modeling PACKage) is a software system specifically designed for solving large-scale general equilibrium models, including the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model.

> In other words, GAMS is a general-purpose modeling system, while GEMPACK is a specialized software system designed for solving large-scale economic models. The GTAP model is implemented in GEMPACK, and users can run the GTAP model by using the GEMPACK software. If you are interested in running the GTAP model, you will need to obtain and install the GEMPACK software, which can be obtained from the official GEMPACK website: https://www.gempack.com/.
