**assistant**:
> The error "AttributeError: can't set attribute" indicates that you're trying to modify an attribute directly on a `result` object returned from executing a query, which is not allowed. Instead, you should issue an update operation directly using SQLAlchemy.
> 
> Here's a modified version of your `incremenet_uses` function to update the `uses` column correctly:
> 
> ```python
> from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
> from sqlalchemy import update
> 
> def increment_uses(engine, items, ids, inc):
>     Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
>     with Session() as session:
>         for id in ids:
>             stmt = update(items).where(items.c.id == id).values(uses=items.c.uses + inc)
>             session.execute(stmt)
>         session.commit()
> ```
> 
> In this version:
> 
> 1. We use the `update` function from SQLAlchemy to create an update statement.
> 2. We specify the new value of `uses` using the `.values()` method, which increments the current value of `uses` by `inc`.
> 3. We execute the update statement with `session.execute(stmt)` and then commit the changes.
> 
> This approach should correctly update the `uses` column for each record in your `items` table.
