**assistant**:
> The cost of installing shutters or shading for a house in the UK can vary widely based on several factors, including the type of shutters or shades, the size of the windows, the material chosen, and the complexity of the installation. Here's a rough breakdown:
> 
> 1. **Types of Shutters/Shading**:
>    - **Interior Shutters**: These can range from £150 to £300 per window, depending on the material (e.g., MDF, vinyl, wood).
>    - **Exterior Shutters**: Typically more expensive, ranging from £500 to £1,500 per window.
>    - **Blinds or Shades**: Generally cheaper than shutters, ranging from £50 to £200 per window for standard options.
> 
> 2. **Materials**:
>    - Premium materials such as hardwood will increase costs, while MDF or vinyl options are more budget-friendly.
> 
> 3. **Installation**:
>    - Professional installation can add £50 to £100 per window, but this can vary based on the complexity and region.
> 
> 4. **Average Cost Per House**:
>    - For a typical 3-bedroom UK home with around 8-10 windows, the total cost could range from £1,200 to £3,000 for interior shutters, and higher for exterior shutters. Blinds might bring that range down to approximately £500 to £1,500.
