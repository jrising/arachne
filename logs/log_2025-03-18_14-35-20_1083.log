> The image is a bar chart titled "Average IRR in Asia, by Sub-Sector." It displays the average Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for various sub-sectors in Asia. The chart is designed with brown bars representing the IRR values associated with each sub-sector. Here's a detailed breakdown:
> 
> 1. **Water Resources and Flood Management**: 
>    - IRR: 17.06
>    - Number of projects: 34
> 
> 2. **Water Supply and Sanitation**: 
>    - IRR: 19.42
>    - Number of projects: 18
> 
> 3. **Energy**: 
>    - IRR: 19.80
>    - Number of projects: 2
> 
> 4. **Resilient Cities**: 
>    - IRR: 23.32
>    - Number of projects: 31
> 
> 5. **Sustainable Agriculture**: 
>    - IRR: 27.78
>    - Number of projects: 55
> 
> 6. **Transport**: 
>    - IRR: 27.82
>    - Number of projects: 25
> 
> 7. **Disaster Risk Management**: 
>    - IRR: 29.07
>    - Number of projects: 11

> 8. **Forestry/Nature**: 
>    - IRR: 36.66
>    - Number of projects: 7
> 
> 9. **Health**: 
>    - IRR: 68.10
>    - Number of projects: 13

> The vertical axis represents the IRR percentage, ranging from 0 to 80. The number in parentheses next to each sub-sector indicates the number of projects assessed. Health has the highest IRR, while Water Resources and Flood Management has the lowest.
> ===
> The image is a bar chart titled "Average IRR in Latin America, by Sub-Sector." It compares the average Internal Rate of Return (IRR) across different sub-sectors.
> 
> The x-axis lists various sub-sectors:
> 
> 1. Water Supply and Sanitation - 20.80
> 2. Resilient Cities - 23.33
> 3. Transport - 24.90
> 4. Disaster Risk Management - 26.00
> 5. Sustainable Agriculture - 30.59
> 6. Energy - 39.00
> 7. Health - 113.40
> 
> The y-axis represents the IRR percentage, ranging from 0 to 125.
> 
> Each sub-sector is represented by a vertical bar, with Health showing the highest IRR at 113.40, significantly higher than the others. The Energy and Sustainable Agriculture sectors follow, with IRRs of 39.00 and 30.59, respectively. The other sub-sectors have IRRs ranging from 20.80 to 26.00.

> Figure 12 shows the average IRR in Asia by sub-sector. The bar chart titled "Average IRR in Asia, by Sub-Sector" displays the IRR values for different sub-sectors, represented by brown bars. The sub-sectors include Water Resources and Flood Management with an IRR of 17.06, Water Supply and Sanitation with an IRR of 19.42, Energy with 19.80, Resilient Cities with 23.32, Sustainable Agriculture with 27.78, Transport with 27.82, Disaster Risk Management with 29.07, Forestry or Nature with 36.66, and Health with the highest IRR of 68.10. The number of projects assessed in each sub-sector varies, with Health having the highest IRR.
> 
> Figure 13 shows the average IRR in Latin America by sub-sector. The bar chart, titled "Average IRR in Latin America, by Sub-Sector," compares IRRs across different sub-sectors. The sub-sectors and their IRRs include Water Supply and Sanitation at 20.80, Resilient Cities at 23.33, Transport at 24.90, Disaster Risk Management at 26.00, Sustainable Agriculture at 30.59, Energy at 39.00, and Health with the highest IRR of 113.40. The Health sector stands out with a significantly higher IRR than the others.
> 
> Additionally, Annex 3 in the text provides average IRRs by sub-sector for the five countries with the greatest number of projects in the database. These countries are India, China, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Brazil. Notably, the variation in IRRs is relatively less for some of these countries. In China, the estimated IRRs for all sub-sectors fall in a relatively narrow band of fifteen to twenty-one percent. Similarly, in Kenya, IRRs for all sub-sectors fall in the range of twenty-two to twenty-six percent, except for one mentioned.
