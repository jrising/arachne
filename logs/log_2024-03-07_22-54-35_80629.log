**user**:
> I have a curve in a plot that shows some jagged behavior-- individual years that are a little above or below the smooth curve. My co-author used the term "jumps" to refer to this, but the irregularities aren't very big. Can you suggest a better term?
**assistant**:
> Certainly, there are a few different descriptive terms you might consider using for minor deviations from a smooth curve:
> 
> - "Blips" or "glitches": These terms suggest minor and temporary deviations. They can be used colloquially to communicate minor errors or unexpected bumps on a curve.
> 
> - "Fluctuations" or "variations": These more neutral terms suggest changes without implying that they are significant, large, or problematic. 
> 
> - "Noise" or "jitter": In data analysis, these terms can be used to describe random variations or fluctuations that are generally small.
> 
> - "Ripples": This term is often used to describe small, regular oscillations. In your case, it might be appropriate if the deviations are relatively regular.
>   
> Choose the term that best describes the nature and pattern of the deviations in your data.
