> No, the ERA5 reanalysis product is not produced by the same model as the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) reanalysis. The ERA5 reanalysis is produced using the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), while the CAMS reanalysis is produced using a different numerical model.
