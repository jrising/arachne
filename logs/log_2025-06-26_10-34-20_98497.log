> In R, how can I make a map of the world, colored in by a value for each country, but with some kind of speckling or diagonal lines for some of the countries (if the value is statistically significant)? I usually make my maps using geom_polygon in ggplot2.
**assistant**:
> To create a world map in R with `ggplot2`, where countries are colored by a specific value and some have speckling or diagonal lines for statistical significance, you can use the `geom_polygon` for coloring and `geom_crossbar` or `geom_textured` for the pattern. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve that:
> 
> 1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure you have a data frame with country codes, values for coloring, and a column indicating statistical significance.
> 
> 2. **Load necessary libraries**:
>    ```r
>    library(dplyr)
>    library(ggplot2)
>    library(rnaturalearth)
>    library(sf)
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Get world map data**:
>    ```r
>    world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Join your data to the map data**:
>    Suppose your data frame is `data` with columns `iso_a3` (for country code), `value`, and `significant`.
>    ```r
>    map_data <- world %>%
>      left_join(data, by = c("iso_a3" = "iso_a3"))
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Create the base map**:
>    ```r
>    base_map <- ggplot(data = map_data) +
>      geom_sf(aes(fill = value), color = "white") +
>      scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis", na.value = "grey90") # Adjust fill scale as needed
>    ```
> 
> 6. **Add speckling for statistically significant countries**:
>    This requires a bit of a workaround to simulate speckling. One approach is to overlay a texture:
> 
>    ```r
>    base_map +
>      geom_sf_pattern(
>        data = map_data %>% filter(significant == TRUE),
>        aes(fill = value, pattern = I("stripe")),
>        pattern_spacing = 0.05,
>        pattern_colour = "white",
>        pattern_fill = "black"
>    ) +
>    theme_minimal()
>    ```
> 
> Remember that aesthetics like `pattern_colour`, `pattern_fill`, and `pattern_spacing` can be adjusted to get the desired effect. If you're dealing with a large dataset and performance becomes an issue, consider using simpler patterns or reducing the resolution.
> 
> This approach allows you to highlight countries with significant values through visual patterns, while keeping the map's color scale representative of the values themselves.
**user**:
> Is it more typical to add striping to areas that are significant or those that aren't? Like, what does the IPCC do?
**assistant**:
> In data visualization, particularly in contexts like climate data or epidemiological studies, it's more common to add striping or visual patterns to areas that are significant rather than those that are not. This helps to emphasize or draw attention to regions where there are notable findings, trends, or values.
> 
> ### IPCC Practices
> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) typically highlights areas of significant concern regarding climate change—such as high emissions regions, vulnerable ecosystems, or countries facing severe impacts. They use color gradients to represent varying levels of risk or change, and any special markings (like patterns or texturing) would likely be used to denote areas that require particular attention, such as those experiencing drastic changes or where empirical data significantly affects predictions.
> 
> ### Summary
> - **Add striping to**: Regions that are statistically significant or notably affected/remedied.
> - **Color gradients**: Used more generally to convey variations in data across different countries or regions.
> 
> This enhances the map's utility by making significant data more visually memorable and actionable. If you're following style guides or best practices in data visualization, striping for significant areas aligns well with established norms.
**user**:
> When I try to ggsave this, I get the error:
> Unknown graphics device "rdata"
**assistant**:
> The error "Unknown graphics device 'rdata'" typically occurs when you attempt to save a plot with `ggsave()` using an unsupported file format. The correct format needs to be specified in the file name or the `device` argument of `ggsave()`. 
> 
> ### Solution:
> 1. **Specify a valid file extension** in your filename (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.svg`).
> 2. Here’s how you can correctly use `ggsave()`:
> 
> ```r
> # Make sure to store your plot in a variable first
> my_plot <- base_map + 
>   geom_sf_pattern(
>     data = map_data %>% filter(significant == TRUE),
>     aes(fill = value, pattern = I("stripe")),
>     pattern_spacing = 0.05,
>     pattern_colour = "white",
>     pattern_fill = "black"
>   ) +
>   theme_minimal()
> 
> # Save the plot using ggsave()
> ggsave("my_map.png", plot = my_plot, width = 10, height = 6)
> ```
> 
> ### Note:
> - If you want to specify the device explicitly, you can do so, for example:
> 
> ```r
> ggsave("my_map.pdf", plot = my_plot, device = "pdf", width = 10, height = 6)
> ```
> 
> ### Common File Formats:
> - `.png`: Portable Network Graphics
> - `.jpg`: Joint Photographic Experts Group
> - `.pdf`: Portable Document Format
> - `.svg`: Scalable Vector Graphics
> 
> Make sure you pick a format suitable for your needs—raster formats like PNG and JPG are good for web use, while PDF and SVG are better for printing or high-quality graphics.
