> 2. High vulnerability to natural disasters such as floods and heatwaves.
> 3. Significant dependence on agriculture and monsoon patterns, making the country sensitive to climate change.

> How is poverty defined for that statistic?
**assistant**:
> Poverty is typically defined as the inability to meet basic needs for survival, which can include food, shelter, clothing, and access to healthcare and education. In the context of global poverty statistics, poverty is often measured by income or consumption levels, using a poverty line set by the World Bank. People living below this line are considered to be living in extreme poverty. In India, the poverty line is defined as an income below which people cannot afford to purchase a minimum basket of goods and services.

**assistant**:
> Some reasons contributing to climate vulnerability among the poor in India are:
> 
> 1. Lack of access to resources and basic services, such as safe housing, clean water, and healthcare.
