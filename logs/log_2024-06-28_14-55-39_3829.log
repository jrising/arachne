**assistant**:
> Yes, you can calculate spatial distances in Google Sheets using the Haversine formula applied via custom formulas. Here's a step-by-step guide to find which row has the shortest distance to a given point:
> 
> ### Step 1: Define the Custom Haversine Function
> 1. Go to **Extensions** > **Apps Script**.
> 2. Delete any code in the editor and replace it with the following:
> 
> ```javascript
> function HAVERSINE(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
>   const R = 6371; // Earth radius in kilometers
>   const toRad = function(value) {
>     return (value * Math.PI) / 180;
>   };
> 
>   const dLat = toRad(lat2 - lat1);
>   const dLon = toRad(lon2 - lon1);
>   const a =
>     Math.sin(dLat / 2) * Math.sin(dLat / 2) +
>     Math.cos(toRad(lat1)) * Math.cos(toRad(lat2)) *
>     Math.sin(dLon / 2) * Math.sin(dLon / 2);
>   const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
>   const distance = R * c;
>   return distance;
> }
> ```
> 3. Save the script by clicking on the floppy disk icon or pressing **Ctrl+S**.
> 4. Close the Apps Script tab.

> ### Step 2: Calculate Distances
> 1. Suppose you have your data in columns `A` (Latitude) and `B` (Longitude). In column `C`, you can compute the distance using the custom Haversine function. For example, if you want to find the distance from a point with latitude `lat0` and longitude `lon0`, enter the following in cell `C2` and drag it down:
> 
> ```excel
> =HAVERSINE(A2, B2, lat0, lon0)
> ```
> 
> Replace `lat0` and `lon0` with your specific latitude and longitude values.
> 
> ### Step 3: Find the Shortest Distance
> 1. To find the row with the shortest distance, you can use the `MIN` function to determine the smallest value and `MATCH` function to find its position. In a new cell (e.g., `D1`), enter:
> 
> ```excel
> =MIN(C2:C)
> ```
> 
> 2. To find the row number, use:
> 
> ```excel
> =MATCH(MIN(C2:C), C2:C, 0)
> ```
> 
> ### Step 4: Retrieve Information from the Closest Row
> If you need to retrieve other information from the closest row, you can use the `INDEX` function along with `MATCH`. For example, to get the latitude from the closest row, use:
> 
> ```excel
> =INDEX(A2:A, MATCH(MIN(C2:C), C2:C, 0))
> ```
> 
> And similarly, use:
> 
> ```excel
> =INDEX(B2:B, MATCH(MIN(C2:C), C2:C, 0))
> ```
> 
> This will give you the latitude and longitude of the point with the shortest distance.
