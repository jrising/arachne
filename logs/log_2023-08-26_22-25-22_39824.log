> How can I execute a shell command in python and not wait for the response
**assistant**:
> In Python, the `subprocess` module provides a way of making system calls without waiting for the process to finish. However, there are certain risks associated with executing shell commands from Python, such as potential code injections. Please, use this carefully and avoid directly passing user-generated inputs to system calls.

> Below is an example of how to execute a shell command without waiting for the response:
> 
> ```python
> import subprocess
> 
> subprocess.Popen(["yourcommand", "yourarg1", "yourarg2"])
> ```
> 
> Here's a real example:
> 
> ```python
> subprocess.Popen(["ls", "-l"])
> ```
> 
> This runs the `ls -l` command in the background. Remember to split your command and its arguments into separate string elements in the list passed to `Popen()`.
> 
> If you're constructing commands with variables, be careful to properly escape and sanitize the inputs to protect from command injection vulnerabilities. In such a case, you can use `shlex` module.
> 
> ```python
> import shlex
> import subprocess
> 
> command = shlex.quote(your_command)
> argument = shlex.quote(your_arg)
> 
> subprocess.Popen([command, argument])
> ```
