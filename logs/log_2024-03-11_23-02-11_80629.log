> I hope this email finds you well. My name is Agnes Baiden, and I am one of the new graduate students admitted to the MSc. Environmental Science and Management program for the upcoming semester. I am writing to express my sincere interest in securing a graduate assistantship position within the realm of Environmental Science and Management.
> 
> With a strong passion for environmental advocacy and community engagement, and experiences gained during my tenure at the Ghana  Environmental Protection Agency, I have cultivated a strong foundation in areas such as climate change, plastic pollution and natural capital. These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills in research, which I am keen to apply to further academic pursuits.
> 
> I am eager to contribute my expertise and passion to ongoing research initiatives within the Climate Science Track. I am particularly interested in exploring opportunities to collaborate on research projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.  
> 
> I am open to various roles within the Graduate Student Assistantship framework, including Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, or any administrative assignment where my skills and background can be effectively utilized. I believe that a graduate assistantship would not only provide valuable financial support but also offer me the opportunity to gain practical experience, collaborate with faculty members and fellow students, and further develop my skills and knowledge in the field. I am adaptable, diligent, and committed to academic excellence, and I am confident that I can make a meaningful contribution to the University of Delaware community.

> Agnes Baiden's email seems very clear in terms of her program of interest. She is admitted into the Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) and she is looking for a graduate assistantship position. She mentioned wanting to work on projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies which aligns well with your area of research.
> 
> She did not mention any previous education from MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD or residing in the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area.

> Dear Agnes,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Given your background and interest in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, it seems you would be a good fit for the Environmental Science & Management program, particularly the climate science track. More importantly, your experiences working with the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency could offer a valuable perspective to our research.
> 
> However, funding is always a constraint. While we do offer limited funding in the form of assistantships in our Environmental Science & Management program, most of our students are self-funded. I encourage you to submit any applications for assistantship positions by the end of the calendar year so you can be considered for any available funds.
