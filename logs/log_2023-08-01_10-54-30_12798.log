> I am looking for an energy transition where a new technology was brought in, as an historical analogy to a future hydrogen economy transition. An important feature of the historical analog would be some kind of shock which starts off the transition, ideally with spatially heterogeneous outcomes. It would also have to be post-1950 (ideally post-1970), so there is adequate data. Any suggestions? Maybe the shale gas revolution? Or the methane rule?

> Absolutely, I can provide a couple of examples of significant energy transitions in modern history that bear similarities to the potential future transition to a hydrogen economy.
> 
> First, as you mentioned, **the shale gas revolution** in the United States is a good case study for an energy transition driven largely by technological advancements. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technology made the extraction of shale gas economically viable, creating a boom in natural gas production.
> 
> This transition was not uniform across the country due to the geographical distribution of shale gas reserves and regulatory differences. States like Pennsylvania, Texas, and North Dakota saw significant economic growth and changes in their energy mix, while others, like New York, decided to ban high-volume hydraulic fracturing due to environmental concerns.

> Post-1970, **the rise of nuclear power** is another useful analogy, although stark differences exist in the risk perception associated with nuclear energy and hydrogen. Technology innovation, electrification needs, and energy independence goals led to a surge in nuclear power plants in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in France, the US, and Japan. This was arguably initiated by the oil shock of the 1973  OPEC embargo, and saw spatially heterogeneous outcomes based on geology, policy, and public sentiment.

> Another parallel could be the transition towards renewable energy, specifically **wind and solar**. Technological advancements combined with economic incentives and environmental goals led to a boom in renewable power capacity mainly starting in the 2000s. This transition has been spatially uneven due to factors such as climate, government policy, and public acceptance. Historic shocks like the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters, the 1970s energy crises, and mounting concerns over climate change have played roles in directing public and policy attitudes towards renewables.

> The "methane rule," which refers to regulations aimed at reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in the US, does not fit as an analogy in the same way. It represents a policy response aiming to curb environmental impacts of an existing energy technology, rather than the introduction or rise of a new one.
