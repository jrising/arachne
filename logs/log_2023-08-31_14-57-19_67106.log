> Can I add an auto-incrementing figure/table number in a Google doc? My organization only allows a few Add-Ons (Asana, RefWorks, Sciwheel).
**assistant**:
> I'm sorry James, but currently, Google Docs doesn't inherently support auto-incrementing figure or table numbers. The add-ons in Google Docs could potentially provide a solution, but since your organization only allow a few, and none of them seem to offer this ability, it's reasonable to say that you're currently limited in options.
> 
> However, I may suggest an effective manual solution, albeit, it requires some attention to keep up:
> 
> Whenever you want to change the figure/table numbers, you could use Google Doc's link labelled as "Bookmark". Here's how:
> 
> 1. Click in front of the title of the chart or table.
> 2. Click "Insert⁠ -> Bookmark".
> 
> Then, whenever you want to refer to the figure or table:
> 
> 1. Click "Insert⁠ -> Link"
> 2. Under "Text," write "Figure X"
> 3. Under "Link," scroll down to "Bookmarks" and select the bookmark for the figure X.
> 
> Each time you add a new figure or table, you will need to manually increase the number by 1.
> 
> While it's not the most elegant solution, it's the only feasible one within the limitations imposed by your organization. This process could also help in maintaining a systematic and organized writing process.
