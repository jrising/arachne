> I am trying to display three figures in a particular arrangement in LaTeX: Figures a and b are on top of eachother in the first column, and figure c spans both columns. Here's my current attempt:
> 
> \begin{figure}[htbp]
> \begin{tabular}{ll}
> (a) Population-weighted mean of model projections & (c) Distribution of end-of-period country impacts \\
> \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{figures/figure1a.pdf} & \multirow{3}{*}{\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{figures/figure1cd.pdf}} \\
> (b) Population-weighted mean of meta-analyses & \\
> \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{figures/figure1b.pdf} & \\
> \end{tabular}
> \end{figure}
> 
> However, the figure on the right isn't centered vertically. It starts half-way down and extends far below the other figures, even though the sizes of the figures are designed for this to work. How can I fix it?
**assistant**:
> The vertical alignment issue is because `\multirow` centers the content with respect to the centerline of the surrounding content. When you're dealing with large content (like images) compared to small content (like text), this can cause unexpected behavior.

> I suggest to use the `minipage` environment instead of `tabular` to embed the figures and their captions. Here is a modified version of your code using `minipage`:
> 
> ```latex
> \begin{figure}[htbp]
>   \centering
>   \begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
>     \centering
>     (a) Population-weighted mean of model projections\\
>     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/figure1a.pdf}\\
>     (b) Population-weighted mean of meta-analyses\\
>     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/figure1b.pdf}
>   \end{minipage}
>   \begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
>     \centering
>     (c) Distribution of end-of-period country impacts\\
>     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/figure1cd.pdf}
>   \end{minipage}
> \end{figure}
> ```

> This will place the three figures side by side, each taking roughly half of the text width. By using `\centering` within each `minipage`, the captions and the figures themselves are also centered within their respective `minipage`s. Adjust the exact width values to your needs.
