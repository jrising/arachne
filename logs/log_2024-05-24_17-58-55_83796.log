> The following is the description of how a boxplot is drawn:
> The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles). The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called "outlying" points and are plotted individually.

> Can you write that in the most abbreviated way possible, to be included in a figure caption?
**assistant**:
> Sure! Here's an abbreviated version for inclusion in a figure caption:

> Boxplot: hinges = Q1 and Q3; whiskers = max/min points within 1.5 * IQR; outliers plotted individually.
