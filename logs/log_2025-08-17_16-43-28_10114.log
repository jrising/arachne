> The symbol of a cobra in ancient Egyptian culture was generally considered a positive and powerful symbol. It was associated with the goddess Wadjet, who was a protector of Lower Egypt and often depicted as a cobra. The cobra symbolized royalty, protection, and divine authority, and it was frequently used in the crowns of pharaohs. Cobras were also associated with the idea of rebirth and renewal, due to their ability to shed their skin. Overall, the cobra was seen as a potent protective emblem in ancient Egyptian symbolism.
