**user**:
> I would like to render sheet music for piano in javascript. One feature I'd like is that the notation I use to embed the music is well-known, so that people don't have to learn a new notation for this library. What library should I use?
**assistant**:
> For your project, I recommend using the **VexFlow** library. VexFlow is a popular JavaScript library for rendering music notation in a web browser, and it supports well-known formats such as **MusicXML** and **ABC notation**. This aligns well with your requirement, as users can provide input in widely understood formats.
> 
> Here are a few features and reasons why VexFlow might be suitable for your needs:
> 
> 1. **Ease of Use**: It is designed to be easy to use and integrates well with HTML5 Canvas and SVG.
>   
> 2. **Compatibility**: By supporting MusicXML, you ensure compatibility with a vast range of music editing software, allowing users to easily exchange and utilize sheet music without needing to learn new systems.
> 
> 3. **Community and Documentation**: VexFlow has a growing community and decent documentation, which can be helpful for both development and troubleshooting.
> 
> 4. **Flexibility**: It provides a good deal of flexibility for rendering music notation and allows for customization and extension if necessary.
> 
> I suggest checking out the [VexFlow GitHub repository](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) and their [official documentation](https://www.vexflow.com/) to get started.
> 
> If you are particularly interested in using ABC notation, you might also consider **abcjs**, which is specifically built for rendering ABC notation into sheet music and integrates seamlessly with browsers.
> 
> Feel free to ask more if you need further assistance or have specific questions about implementation!
