> I exported a mongodb database a while back, and it's somewhere in my files, but I need to search for it. What would the filename have been?
**assistant**:
> When you export a MongoDB database, the filename typically follows a pattern, especially if you used specific tools or commands for the export.
> 
> 1. **Using `mongodump`:**
>    - The export likely created a `.bson` file. If you exported the entire database, the filenames would be in the form `collection.bson` for each collection in the database.
>    - A `mongodump` export is usually saved in a directory structure like:
>      ```
>      dump/
>        database_name/
>          collection1.bson
>          collection2.bson
>          ...
>      ```
> 
> 2. **Using `mongoexport`:**
>    - The file might be a `.json` or `.csv` file. The name is generally either specified by you at the time of export or defaulted to the name of the collection or database.
>    - The command you might have used would be:
>      ```
>      mongoexport --db=database_name --collection=collection_name --out=filename.json
>      ```
>      So, look for `.json` or `.csv` files with relevant names.
> 
> 3. **Using other tools or utilities:**
>    - If you used a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass or other third-party tools, the filenames might vary but typically end in `.bson`, `.json`, or `.csv`.
> 
> ### Steps to Find the File
> 
> 1. **Search for common extensions:**
> ```bash
> find /path/to/search -iname "*.bson" -o -iname "*.json" -o -iname "*.csv"
> ```
> 
> 2. **Search for common directory names:**
> ```bash
> find /path/to/search -type d -name "dump" -o -name "database_name"
> ```
> 
> Replace `/path/to/search` with the parent directory where you believe the files might be stored.
