> 15.1.1 Rising Food Insecurity in West Africa (relate to SDGs)
> 
> The prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity across LLMIC has increased by an average 13% since 2015. In 2021, over half of LLMICs experienced food insecurity impacting at least 50% of their populations. West Africa is characteristic of this trend, and food insecurity has been rising in Senegal and Nigeria since 2017 (see Fig. 1).

> 
> Food insecurity continues to rise, even as total per capita calories supply has increased across most of West Africa. This paradox of greater food availability and greater food insecurity is driven by problems with access, nutrition, and reliability, as well as by export-driven agriculture. Food wastage is also a growing problem across sub-Saharan Africa which needs to be addressed through better access to refrigeration and preservation techniques (Sheehan and Barrett, 2017). In the aquatic food production chain, improved implementation of safety and quality assurance systems will lead to safer food with higher nutritional quality, extended shelf-life and reduced post-harvest losses (GarridoGamarro et al, 2023).
> 
> Lack of nutritious food helps to explain the high rates of stunting in these two countries: 31.5% in Nigeria and 17.9% in Senegal (World Bank Data).
> 
> These two countries also reflect the high prevalence of small-holder farming and fishing. Nigeria is estimated to have 300,000 family farms and 3.3 million people involved in small-scaling fishing. The numbers for Senegal are 440,000 and 120,000.

> 15.1.2 Overview of Climate Changes and Impacts on Agriculture and Fisheries
> 
> Existing research suggests climate-driven losses to crucial agricultural production for staple crops across the developing world. While this is partially offset by increased CO2, crop nutrient contents are expected to diminish. 
> Climate change also affects fisheries and marine environments, by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean such as temperatures, pH, oxygen content and salinity (World Bank (2019), Kroetz et al. (2022), Abbot et al. (2022), Asche et al. (2022), Cojocaru et al. (2022)). These attributes can contribute to undesirable impacts on fish stock movements but also fish habitats including population shifts, fish density and demography, increased mortality at different life-stages of  fish species, to finally affect fish population productivity and distribution. More broadly, these environments provide a multitude of globally important ecosystem services beneficial for human health and wellbeing (Hattam et al., 2015), including provisioning services (e.g., seafood, medicines (FAO, 2018)), regulatory services (e.g., climate regulation, nutrient recycling (van den Belt et al., 2016)), and cultural services (e.g., recreation/tourism (Rees et al., 2010)). Aquatic food alone is a key source of protein for 3.2 billion people, especially in developing countries (FAO, 2018). However, human actions have severely degraded global marine ecosystems’ abilities to deliver these services, with direct and indirect implications for the health of billions of people (Depledge et al., 2019; Fleming et al., 2019; Borja et al., 2020). Collapsing fish stocks due to overfishing and habitat destruction (FAO, 2018).
> 
> 15.1.3 Importance of Ecosystem Services
> 
> While existing research connects agricultural and fisheries productivity to climatic features (growing degree-days, rainfall, sea surface temperatures), the role of ecosystem services is understudied. We seek to fill this gap with this project by analyzing how the impacts of climate change could depend upon the gradual evolution of ecosystem health. Agriculture depends on ecosystem processes that ensure soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and water purification. Fisheries need thriving habitats and balanced food webs. Such ecosystem services are likely to be affected by climate change factors.

> 15.1.4 Role and Vulnerability of Small-holder Farmers and Fishers
> 
> The food system is complex, with some populations particularly vulnerable to near-term climate impacts. Such effects have significant implications for our ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. SDG 1, 2, 3, 13, 14 15). We will determine the consequences for low-income countries like those in North-West Africa, and their most vulnerable populations, in collaboration with researchers having existing stakeholder relationships and access to on-the-ground data. We are interested in identifying health disparities between groups, with a view toward social justice, and determine how vulnerable they are as a result of climate change impact on the food industry. Our goal is to co-create tools or data facilitating the resilience of these vulnerable groups to health risks, as well as design and suggest mitigation and adaptation policies and risk management.
> 
> Our focus will be on farmers and fishers and their surrounding communities. Subsistence producers and small-holder producers who use proceeds to purchase food are particularly vulnerable. In addition, heat has direct impacts on farmer/fisher health and can undermine other sources of rural income.
> 
> 15.1.5 Consequences of Malnutrition on Health
> 
> Food scarcity, due to crop failure and weakened fisheries, can lead to malnutrition; foods deficient in essential nutrients like protein, zinc, and iron can lead to nutrient deficiency; and increased harmful algal blooms can result in shellfish poisoning.
> 
> 15.2 Research plan (Intro: 0.5 pg)
> 
> Our research focuses on the implications of climate change on food production from the agricultural and fishing sectors, subsequent consequences for health, and determining which social groups will be the most affected. We will pay special attention to  vulnerable populations. Climate variables and air pollution can influence physiology and human health endpoints, which can depend on, e.g., age and gender (demographic characteristics), health status, socio-economic conditions (including worker environments and labor conditions), adaptation policies, and the functioning of food and health systems.
> We will take into account a specific portfolio of climate change factors that influence the relationships between exposure to environmental factors and outcomes for agriculture and fish productivity, food security and human health. These two economic sectors, agriculture and fishing, are the most important sources of nutrition for human beings.

> Data
>            	Climate variables 
> Precipitation datasets will be Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS v2.0) (spatial resolution: 0.05°; [PM2] temporal resolution: daily; time period: 1981–2021) (Funk et al., 2015), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) (spatial resolution: 0.25°; temporal resolution: daily; time period used: 1998–2015) (Huffman et al., 2007), Climate Research Unit (CRU) v3.23 (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: daily; time period used:  1981–2021) (Harris),  and Willmot-Matsura (WM) (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: monthly; time period used: 1991–2017) (Willmot & Matsura). Temperature datasets will be Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) (spatial resolution: 1°; temporal resolution: monthly; time period used: 1989–2021) (Rohde et al.,2013), Climate Research Unit (CRU) v3.23 (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: daily; time period used/available:  1989–2021) (Harris et al., 2014), and Willmot-Matsura (WM) (spatial resolution: 0.5°; temporal resolution: monthly; time period used/available:  1989–2017) (Willmot & Matsura).  These datasets will be used to calculate a suite of variables to quantify climate anomalies (Table 1). The mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperatures were determined by calculating temporal averages of the monthly temperature, monthly minimum temperature, and monthly maximum temperature, respectively, over the course of the main growing season (March to October). Diurnal temperature range was calculated as the difference between the maximum and the minimum temperatures recorded over a 24-hour period. 5-year and 10-year rainfall anomalies were calculated as the mean deviation from the long-term average rainfall over the prior five- and ten- years, respectively. Infrastructural and demographic data of most parts of NinIgeria are available from GRID3 Nigeria (grid3.gov.ng) and also the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS: https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/)l data will be leveraged for the project  analysis. 
> Demographic health surveys
> Some of the main health data will come from the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) (DHS 2008, 2013, 2018[MP3] ), which are nationally representative household-level survey data on demography, health, and nutrition. We will use all DHS survey years for which georeferenced data were available. The DHS variables of interest are child age, wealth index, time to water, education of household head, improved toilet, improved water, and 24-hour recall for 10 food groups (which asks the respondents to recall what they feed their children under five in the previous 24 hours). This 24-recall variable is a qualitative measure of food consumption that indicates household access to different types of foods and is also a proxy for nutrient sufficiency of the diet of individuals (Kennedy et al., 2011). We will use this information to calculate our outcome variable of interest – individual diet diversity score (IDDS) for each child under 5. IDDS is calculated based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (Kennedy et al., 2011), and is a scale ranging from 1 to 10 based on the intake of 10 different types of food groups including: (a) cereal grains, (b) white tubers and root foods, (c) dark leafy greens, (d) vitamin A rich vegetables/tubers, (e) vitamin A rich fruits, (f) other fruits and vegetables, (g) meat and fish foods, (h) eggs, (i) legumes/nuts/seeds, and (j) milk and milk products. Other covariates variables used for this analysis are described in the section immediately below.
> Covariates of dietary and economic outcomes
> Population density data will come from NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) (CIESIN, 2018) database at a spatial resolution of 30-arcsec (1km). The year of the data used for an individual cluster will depend on the year of the DHS survey. We will average the population density over a 5-kilometer radius for each DHS cluster. We will calculate distance to roads using the Global Distribution of Roads dataset from NASA SEDAC (CIESIN, 2013). We will calculate distance to urban centers using the Gridded Population of the World database (version 1) from NASA SEDAC (MEA, 2005). We will calculate livestock density data using the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW3) database (Gilbert et al., 2010) which provides the global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, and ducks for the year 2010. In each country and for each type of livestock, a livestock unit will be calculated by taking the ratio of production in tonnes to the number of animals produced/slaughtered (FAOSTAT, 2023). This factor will then be multiplied by the population density rasters of each animal, and all rasters will be added to obtain the total livestock unit for each grid cell. We will average the livestock density within 10 kilometers of each DHS cluster and categorize it into 8 different quantile-based classes based on the distribution of the data for each country. Initial forest cover will be defined as any 30m by 30m pixel having a tree cover percentage of greater than 50% in the year 1999 using Tropical Moist Forest (TMF) dataset (Vancutsum et al., 2020), and all locations of known tree plantations (i.e., not native forests) will be excluded from our analysis. A pixel will be defined as experiencing forest loss when the pixel category changes from undisturbed in year t to degraded in year t+1. We will assume that any pixel experiencing forest loss undergoes complete forest loss and remains unforested for the remainder of the study period. We will not consider forest gain in our calculations of deforestation rates as areas of forest gain in the focus regions are much smaller than those of forest loss. 
> Analyses
> Mapping of staple crop type and productivity
> We will employ remote sensing, deep/machine learning, and on-ground data collection to develop field-scale maps of cropped area and yields for staple crops (cassava, millets, rice, sorghum, yams) within the focus regions. 
> Automated field delineation: Training/validation data of field boundaries will be manually delineated using an existing QGIS labelling platform developed by co-PI Davis. This work is already underway. Locations of data collection will employ a stratified sampling that accounts for cropping intensity and agro-ecological zones. These data will be used to train and test deep learning convolutional neural networks to classify pixels in 3 meter cloud-free composite Planet imagery3 into three categories: field edge; field interior; non-field. Pixels classified as field edge and interior will be merged with the vectorized output of a 5-step image segmentation process: 1) apply a meanshift algorithm to identify edge features; 2) segment the edge image using segment sizes finer than the expected field size (~1 ha); 3) merge resulting polygons based on mean normalized band values; 4) intersect merged polygons with classified field interior map to retain crop fields; and 5) refine and smooth crop field polygons. These steps will produce polygonized representations of individual fields.  
> Machine Learning Pipeline for Crop Type Ground-Truth Labels: In-country data gathering will collect ground-truth labels for crop type mapping in each field. We will use the Street2Sat pipeline4 – developed by project collaborators at NASA Harvest – to convert georeferenced GoPro images into georeferenced labelled (crop-specific) point samples. Coordinating with NASRDA and IITA, data will be collected using roof-mounted GoPro Hero 8 cameras facing orthogonal to the drive direction. Within each GoPro image, individual plants will be assigned crop-type-specific bounding boxes via object detection (trained using manually labelled images). Combining information on the focal length of the image with the heights of the bounding box, image, sensor, and crop (determined based on crop type and growing stage), we will then calculate a depth (from the camera to the bounding box of an individual plant) and average the depths of all bounding boxes of the same crop type to determine a single field depth. The compass direction that the image was taken is determined using the velocity vector of the drive data set. Combining information on field depth and image direction then allows the GPS coordinates of the vehicle image to be offset into the field. This crop type ground-truth data will be combined with field-delineated cropland maps (developed above) and seasonal median composite images for each band of Planet imagery and Sentinel 1 & 2 imagery and input into a Random Forest and Neural Network classifiers to assign a crop type to each individual field.
> Field-scale yield modelling under current and future climate: Staple crop yields will be estimated following the protocol co-developed by NASRDA and the China National Space Administration. Ground-truth productivity estimates are collected using handheld georeferenced smartphones equipped with a custom app to photographically evaluate crop status. Spatial yield estimates will be developed using statistical and process-based crop models taking into account crop type, soil characteristics, climate conditions, CO2 fertilization, and management practices. In collaboration with the GGCMI (Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison) Project, these models will also be used to evaluate changes in productivity under a suite of future climate scenarios. 
> Random forest and cross-validation
> We applied a random forest machine learning algorithm to evaluate the correlation between annual rates of cropland expansion/abandonment (by crop type) and a suite of climate variables. Random forest is a non-parametric statistical method that uses decision trees to perform regressions or classifications and is robust to overfitting (Breiman, 2001). This method has been previously applied in the analysis of agricultural outcomes (including planted area) in association with climate variables (Vogel et al., 2019; Hoffman et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2023). All data will be randomly partitioned into an 80% and 20% split for training and validation. Hyperparameters (i.e., the number of trees to build, maximum depth of the tree, minimum leaf node size, and number of features to use for splitting) used in each model were tuned based on a grid search approach (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). To estimate and compare the cropland change variance explained by climate variables, we will calculate R2 values from cross-validated predictions. 
> Mixed effects regression modelling of association between cropland expansion/abandonment and child diet diversity
> Using multilinear mixed effects regression models, we will assess the relationship between cropland expansion and IDDS, while controlling for multiple agroecological, geographic and socioeconomic variables that are known to influence diet diversity (Equation X). We will use the survey years as random effects in our model. This will enable us to evaluate whether climate-associated changes in cropland are associated with changes in rural diet diversity.

> To fully examine the economic and social impacts, and health consequences of climate change on Nigeria’s and Senegal’s populations, we will study in WP4 both the current and prospective biological and economic feasibility of the fishing sector in Senegal and agricultural crop production in Nigeria as well as the characteristics of the consumption of fish in Senegal and agricultural crops in Nigeria under different climate change scenarios.
>  The main objectives of this Work Package 4 are:
>  1)     To develop two bioeconomic models that takes into account climate change impacts: on the agricultural sector in Nigeria (e.g., on land-use, farm production processes of staple products, profits and revenues), and on the fisheries sector in Senegal (e.g., catch/harvest/landing of the most important fish species, profits and revenues); and more specifically on the agricultural crops and fish species that are crucial for the nutrition needs in these countries.
>  
> 2)     To study the characteristics of and contributing factors to current and prospective consumption of both fish and staple agricultural crops in Senegal and Nigeria, respectively
>  
> 3)     To analyze the food systems and security in Nigeria and Senegal, giving attention to the market structure of the most important agricultural and fish products and their social and economic impacts in light of climate change events.
>  
> 4)     To use our bioeconomic models to measure the welfare effects that changes in climate may have on (agricultural and fisheries) producers and consumers (of agricultural products and fishes) when prices and quantities in the respective sectors as a result of climate change. By examining the economic impacts of climate change on society through fisheries, we will thus analyze both consumer and producer surpluses.
>  
> 5)     To conduct an econometric analysis of our theoretical bioeconomic models using the data that will be provided by WP2 and WP3 (e.g., fish and staple crop prices, fish quantity landed/harvested fish and agricultural crop production, costs of the fishing and agriculture activities, and environmental variables (related to climate change)), to measure the degree by which the typical farmer in Nigeria and the typical fisher in Senegal are operation optimally. We will obtain estimates of the parameters to the yield-effort curve (i.e., catch per unit of effort on effort), and agriculture crop productivity/yield (i.e., weight per ha.)
>  The analysis of the supply and demand of this WP4 will be useful for WP5 to determine whether the basicbasis nutrition needs of the Senegalese and Nigerian populations are met and will be metmeet over time, and are sufficient enough for these populations to maintain food security and healthy lives.

> 2. 	BACKGROUND
> Nigeria is home to approximately 184 million people—the largest population of all West African countries. The Nigerian agricultural sector is also dominated by rainfed and employs around 36% of the labor force; and more that 80% are non-homogenous smallholder farmers who provide 90% of Nigeria’s agricultural produce (Afcfta (2020)). Over 70% of Nigerians engage in the agricultural sector mainly at a subsistence level (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1165865/contribution-of-oil-sector-to-gdp-in-nigeria/). Also, according to Afcfta (2020), it contributed to 22% of Nigerian’s GDP in the first quarter of 2020 (somewhat lower than in 2019), but the cumulative agriculture imports, over the years of 2016 and 2019, stood at N3.35 trillion which four times higher than the agriculture export of N803 billion during the same period. Many of the explanations for this situation, according to FAO, are poor land tenure system, low level of irrigation farming, climate change and land degradation. Others are low technology, high production cost and poor distribution of inputs, limited financing, high post-harvest losses and poor access to markets.
>  Some of the urgent measures that need to be taken are promoting rehabilitation of degraded lands and reducing erosion and climate vulnerability. Nigeria has 70.8 million hectares of agricultural land area with maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam beans, millet and rice being the major crops. Nigeria’s rice production rose from 3.7 million metric tons in 2017 to 4.0 million metric tons in 2018. In spite of this, only 57 percent of the 6.7 million metric tons of rice consumed in Nigeria annually is locally produced leading to a deficit of about 3 million metric tons, which is either imported or smuggled into the country illegally https://www.statista.com/statistics/1135880/agricultural-areas-in-nigeria/. As for cassava, Nigeria produced 59 million tons in 2017, making it the world’s largest producer (approximately 20 percent of global production). The economic potentials are enormous, with high revenue yields from both domestic value addition and derived income as well as revenues for the government. With improved varieties and production techniques, production is anticipated to increase. (https://www.fao.org/nigeria/fao-in-nigeria/nigeria-at-a-glance/en/).
> The agricultural sector in Africa, including Nigeria experiences severe challenges arising from climate change due to rising level of “greenhouse” gasses (GHGs) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (Fofana 2011, Lokonon 2018, Adeleye et al 2021), and employs 55–62% of the sub-Saharan workforce and 95% of cropland is rainfed (Trisos et al. 2022, (Osabohien et al. 2020). The effects of emissions and climatic shocks (e.g., heat intensity, variable rainfall) are predicted to result in depletion of soil nutrients, low productivity, shortage of food and welfare of the African farmers (Osabohien et al. 2020, Osofur and Nnorom 2014, Hatfield et al. 2018). Estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Trisos et al. 2022) indicate that future warming will negatively affect food systems in Africa by shortening growing seasons and increasing water stress. Although yield declines for some crops may be partially compensated by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, global warming above 2°C will result in yield reductions for staple crops across most of Africa compared to 2005 yields (Trisos et al. 2022). Onyeneke et al. (2020) reviews the literature on the effect of climate change on the Nigerian agricultural sector.
>  In Senegal, fish and fisheries are a source of income and job opportunities. Negative impacts of climate on fish harvesting may have greater implications on food security of their populations, and more so where other natural resource sectors such as agriculture are projected to see large declines in yield under climate change fishing is the second largest employer and source of livelihood in Senegal, Senegalese population is around 16 million people. With 720 km of coastline, Senegal has a coastline rich in fish, which has generated a fisheries area in the area of the Sub-Regional Commission for Fisheries (CSRP), both in terms of human numbers (employing 15% of the labor force) and capture volumes. Fisheries constitute the "safety net" of the food security of the Senegalese by covering more than 75% of animal protein requirements. With more 600,000 people whose livelihoods depend on fishing. Economically, fishing accounts for 3.5% of Senegal’s GDP, for a revenue estimated at €305 million. It accounts for 20.9% of revenue of exports (€176 million) (Dème et al. 2021). Senegal has an average fish trade surplus of about 136,392 tons, contributing to reducing Africa's trade deficit in terms of fishing products. Yet, stocks are declining due to overexploitation, leading to a decline in productivity and a decreasing biodiversity along the coastline. The fishing sector in Senegal faces severe challenges under climate change as a result of changing water temperature and projected mangrove losses. Changes in sea surface temperature will also adversely affect fish stocks (Belhabib et al 2016).
> Per capita annual consumption of fish in Senegal has been dropping from year to year, for example, it went from 29 kg 2008 to 16 kg in 2018. Per capita production is expected to be in the order of 32 kg/person/year if it were entirely destined for the domestic market (compared to the current 16). Despite the relatively low level of per capita fish consumption in Senegal which is a Low-Income Food-Deficit Country (LIFDC), the contribution of fish to animal protein intake is relatively large (24%) in Senegal. (Müller et al. 2011). The ration of food supply of the Senegalese people, in the absence of any significant change, remains dominated by rice and fishery products, including small pelagic. Prices of meat and chicken are too high and rising. Adverse developments in the fishing sector in Senegal as a result of climate change alone could have significant implications for people who depend on fish for food and as a source of nutrition, income and job opportunities, and the contribution of fisheries to Senegal as a country.
> Climate change is expected to undermine marine ecosystems by changing physicochemical parameters of the ocean such as temperatures, pH, ocean circulation patterns, oxygen content, nutrient contents and salinity. These attributes can contribute to undesirable impacts on fish stock composition but also fish habitats. Studies on the marine ecosystems indicate that warming oceans can have adverse effects such as restructuring of species composition (Fodrie et al. 2010; Wernberg et al. 2016; Flanagan et al. 2019); changes in species phenology (Edwards and Richardson 2004; Mills et al. 2013; Staudinger et al. 2019); changes in geographic species distributions (Pinsky et al. 2013; Poloczanska et al. 2013);  potential fisheries yields (Free et al. 2019); accessibility of target species to fisherman (Young et al. 2018; Pinsky and Fogarty 2012; Hughes et al. 2015), changes in stock productivity (Hare and Able 2007; Bell et al. 2014; Pershing et al. 2015); possible global loss of biomass in the oceans, especially at the middle and lower latitudes (Lotze et al. 2019); potential decline in landings by the 21st century on many of the most valuable fishing grounds (Cheung et al. 2010).
> 3.     ANALYSIS OF THE SUPPLY
> Production risks have immediate and possibly irreversible consequences for consumption. Food security is inherently an issue of risk management.
> Individuals make production, consumption, and exchange/trade decisions subject to considerable uncertainty – both in terms of the biological environment (rainfall, adverse weather conditions, pests and diseases) and in terms of the economic environment (volatile and too high prices, availability of goods and services), including uncertain political climate.
> We will develop integrated bio-economic models for the agriculture sector in Nigeria, and for the fisheries sector in Senegal with the goal of respectively studying the interaction of both the biophysical/agro-ecological and the biophysical/fisheries-ecology processes with social economic processes. We will integrate these processes in a bioeconomic model that analyzes the effect of climate change on the Senegalese marine ecosystem and the Nigerian agricultural ecosystem, and to make projections over possible production gaps in the very short-run (3 years) but also in the next 30 years (i.e., 2050). Such projections will be used in WP5 to make projections of potential nutrition gaps and consequently health also in the next 30 years. Bioeconomics concentrates on maximizing net economic yield while maintaining sustainable ecological yield. We will also take into account in this modeling, how climate change will influence such decision making.
> 
> 3.1  Optimal management of fishing. bioeconomic modeling and the role of climate change in the fish supply in Senegal. Theory and empirical analysis.
> For an optimal management of fisheries, it is crucial to determine for example how much should the optimal catch/harvest be, how many boats should be optimally used, what the optimal level of effort any given period and future pathway should be. For given fishing methods and the management arrangements, effort is measured for example by the number of vessels, the number of hooks set, and the number of fishing days or nights, amount of gear deployed, hours of trawling, number of gillnets, frequency of fishing activities.
>  Actual catch might not necessarily equal the maximum catch potential (MCP) because catch may be influenced by climate change in addition to other factors such as fisheries management type, fishing cost and subsidies, and other economic factors which include financial constraints and fish market structure. Economics of fish harvesting provides both a target and a framework to help overcome overharvesting, which can both guide toward the objectives to lowering catches that are required for stock rebuilding. Fishers could potentially be operating on negative rents or profits (Dupont, 1990)) where the cost of fishing is higher than the income generated (Obegi et al. 2020), and to reverse such type of outcomes, they would need to evaluate their production operations. It is also crucial to assess at the same time, the influence of different policies such as the quota constraints and adaptive responses of the fishing fleets. Importantly, the implementation of policies to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate has now and will have over time an important role to maintain if not improve the productivity in the fisheries sector.
>  
> To address such issues, we will elaborate a bioeconomic model which will integrate economic and biological properties of fisheries, and take into account important and relevant features to the fishing sector in Senegal, and how these elements including effort and catch can be affected by climate change. We will thus evaluate the current and future sustainability of capture fisheries in the open sea or natural environment involving biophysical elements such as ocean temperatures, ocean acidity, deoxygenation.
> We will consider a dynamic model but for comparison purposes, we will also consider a static model. The dynamic model will take into account the length of the time horizon (finite or infinite) and the nature of all the relevant feedback mechanisms over time. They will be modeled sequentially over time or in such a way that future decisions feedback into the present to give an overall optimum for the period of the model.
>  Our bioeconomic modeling analysis together with our analysis of the demand for fish, will help to determine whether this demand is and will be fully satisfied by the current and expected fisheries economic and business activities. The assessment of possible current and future fish demand-supply gaps will be crucial for providing evidence about the current and prospective economic conditions of the fishers, and the effects on the nutrition and health prospects of the Senegalese population. The latter analysis will be done in WP5.
>  Our Bioeconomic modeling will be useful for:
> a)     Determining the optimal equilibrium levels of effort, catch, profits of the fishers, maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the maximum economic yield (MEY), the yield under the free-access fishery, and the effort to achieve at the MSY and MEY.
>  We will control for the effects of other factors such as fisheries management, fishing costs, fish prices, and government policies such as subsidies granted to the fishery sector.
>  b)     Analyzing the welfare effects (on producers and consumers) resulting from changes in the environmental quality that results from climate change: i) how the commercial harvesting and revenues of fish stocks whose population dynamics are influenced by environmental quality and climate change; and ii) how consumers of fish is affected by a possible reduction of fish harvesting and prices.
>  c) 	Conducting an econometric analysis of the bioeconomic modeling in light of different climate change scenarios.
>  Using data on fish prices, effort, quantity landed, costs of the fishing activity or fishing boats, and environmental variables (related to climate change), we will estimate our bioeconomic model and the corresponding MSY, MEY, effort and catch/harvest. Such estimates can be compared with the actual observable data to determine if the fish sector in Senegal is currently operating optimally and if not, analyze what factors that could contribute to operate optimally including measures to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.
>  For instance, if the number of fishers, fuel costs, or other operating costs are higher than the stipulated by the optimal MSY, there might be the need to evaluate how these operating costs could be reduced without ignoring the social impacts on the fishers and society.
> Some of the questions that we aim to answer from our theoretical model analyzing the economic and biological effects of fishing under open access and managed fisheries, and the econometric analysis are:
>  1.     What is the effort level to lead to an economic equilibrium in the fish harvesting industry when the goal is to achieve the MSY? What would that effort be when the goal is to achieve the MEY? How different are these equilibrium optimal levels of effort and yields from the actual observed data on effort and yield.
> 
> 2.     How would relevant variables representing climate change (temperatures, ocean currents, rainfall, ocean acidification, ocean deoxygenation, etc.) affect effort and harvesting at equilibrium? We will account that stock could be also affected by climate change.
>  
> 3.     Which incentives or policies (subsidies, quotas) could be implemented in order to induce the fishers to use the necessary effort to harvest fishes with high level of nutrients and still attain and optimal sustainable yield (or maximum sustainable yield)?
>  
> 4.     Are the costs of harvesting high-nutrient fishes too high for the fishers? (Stock of such fishes is too low?) (Is the harvest of high-nutrient fishes too uncertain?)
>  
> 5.     Will prices of these high nutrient fishes be high enough for fishers to obtain an optimal sustainable rent?
>  
> 6.     Will the fishes become unaffordable to the average household and those with low incomes?
> EXTENSIONS TO CONSIDER
> ·   	Uncertainty: We shall consider the uncertainty that exists within the systems (e.g., ecosystems; food systems) being modeled as well as uncertainty about the performance of the model. Our modeling considers expectation formation of outcomes for the decision variables and accounts for the stochastic element in assessing the actual outcome and performance (e.g., by sampling and measurement errors) from year to year.
>  ·       Asymmetric information problems among the stakeholders
> A state of asymmetric information exists where the fishermen are better informed about for example the fish stock, catch quantity, quality of the catch/harvest than society including policymakers. One important problem that could arise as a result of information asymmetries under fishing open-access is that, the individual fisher might disregard resource conservation measures and not disclose his/her actual catch, thereby, the effect that his/her harvest has on the harvest of other fishers even when catch/harvest restriction policies are in place.
> 3.2 Optimal management of agriculture. Bioeconomic modeling and the role of climate change (supply) for Nigeria. Theory and empirical analysis
> We will evaluate the social and economic sustainability of the agriculture production process involving biophysical elements such as soil quality, organic matter, water used in agriculture activities, under different climate change scenarios.
>  Land degradation, low productivity, poverty and declining human welfare are the dominant problems of the crop production systems prevalent in Nigeria. WP4 will examine biophysical and economic outcomes and their interactions, and how these are affected by climate change at the farm household level using a bio-economic model as opposed to a purely economic or biophysical model. The model will be tested using data for staple agricultural crops from Nigeria.
>  Our modeling will study different management options with their corresponding set of outcomes/goals such as water balance, minimization of land erosion, optimal use of fertilizers, etc.
>  Two versions of the bio-economic model will be considered: a) a static model; and b) a dynamic model. The static model simultaneously optimizes both environmental and economic goals of the farm household and its results are used to validate the dynamic model. The dynamic model optimizes a farm household utility function that is indirectly linked to the biophysical aspects of the landscape through for example a possible soil loss-yield and their lagged values. Soil losses in one year determine yields of various crops in the following year depending on the type of fertilizers use. Both versions of the model take into account seasonality in input and output supplies, labor substitutability, the various roles of crop constraints, minimum household food requirements, and biophysical aspects of soil erosion and nutrient balances arising from these activities.
> 4. 	DEMAND
>  
> 4.1  DEMAND FOR FISH AND STAPLE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, MINIMUM NUTRITION NEEDS AND HEALTH IMPACTS
> To determine whether there is a demand-supply gap, one needs to determine not only the sustainability, profitability and productivity of the fishing and agricultural industries but also the patterns of and contributing factors to the consumption development of fish and staple crops, today and in the future, in Senegal and Nigeria, respectively. Such analysis will be useful for WP5 to determine whether the basis nutrition needs of the Nigerian and Senegalese populations are met and are sufficient enough for them to maintain healthy lives.
>  To analyze the drivers of the demand for fisheries products in Senegal and agricultural products in Nigeria, we need to look for previous household surveys to obtain information about the consumption patterns of Senegalese and Nigerian households (fish, vegetables, grains, meat consumption). Also, data on the social, economic and demographic characteristics of these households are necessary for this analysis. Population growth will be taken into account.
> 
> a)     First analysis: Estimate the short- and long-run income elasticities of demand for fisheries and agricultural products. The relevant literature has shown that the demand for fish and agricultural products at the household level, as at the national level, is quite responsive to changes in income. Consumer theory suggests that these income responses will be greater for lower income groups. Other evidence suggests that urbanization also increases fish consumption and staple crops through changing preferences. The estimation of the long-run income elasticities will allow us to project the long-run demand for fisheries and agricultural crops consumption, and consequently evaluate whether consumption for fisheries and agricultural staple crops are currently met and whether will be met given the current and future fish and crop production (obtained from our bioeconomic modeling), respectively.
>  
> b)     Second analysis: Estimate how the food fish and agricultural crop demands respond to price changes. Consumer theory suggests that real fish or staple crop price rises will reduce fish or staple crop consumption, and that this reduction is larger for lower income groups. Reduction in fish and staple crop production, which can occur as a result of climate change and adverse changes in the environment and ecosystems (marine and agricultural), will inevitably increase prices of fish and agricultural staple crops, and consequently consumption. How will such unfavorable effects affect nutrition capabilities and health conditions, is the analysis to be done in WP5.
>  
> We will thus use and analyze all possible available local data, including survey data, on fish and agricultural crop consumption of different demographic, economic and social groups. In particular, the Demographic Health Survey includes consumption data for children describing grains, 3 categories of vegetables, legumes, fruits, juice, milk and other dairy, porridge or gruel, and meat, poultry, eggs, or fish for six years in Nigeria and ten years in Senegal. WP5 will evaluate the nutrition value of such consumption. Any possible gap on consumption data, will be complemented by using the actual fish harvesting and agricultural production, and their market distribution (both local markets and exports), to estimate the potential consumption across difference demographic, social and economic groups, using the methodology of Deaton and Zaidi (2002), FAO (2017) and Kébé (1998).
>  5. FOOD SYSTEMS. MARKET STRUCTURE
> We will take into account the structure of Senegalese fish market and the Nigerian agricultural staple crops market, in addition to government regulations. We will also consider the price determination in these markets.
> A lack of organization in the marketing circuit or chain can be the cause of huge losses and any gains productivity in the fishery and agricultural sector, but also deficiencies in satisfying the consumption of fish and staple crops essential for nutrition and health especially of the vulnerable population.
> We will include in our study the different levels of distribution (wholesalers and retailers) of fish and agricultural products ending in the consumers’ hands, but also the potential consumers: household level (specially the poor and in disadvantage), at the service sector level (restaurants and hotels) and the international importers.
> WP5. Nutrition Gap and Health Evaluation and Risk Analysis (Lead:   UD) (1 pg.)
> 
> Food security depends upon both the quantity and quality of accessible food. The outcomes of WP4 will provide a market basket of goods consumed by vulnerable communities in Nigeria and Senegal, along with their embedded nutritional content from WP2 and WP3. This WP will translate that food consumption into human health outcomes. Reduction in food wastage will also be considered within this context. With perishable items that cannot be retrieved, a circular economy for biomass conversion to fertilizer or energy should also be an option. The University of Delaware’s plan to develop a sustainable development hub for a circular food economy would be an important support mechanism for this project. 
> 
> We will blend model-based nutrition gap approaches with empirical approaches to estimate health outcomes. To do so, we will look at three levels of health outcomes: (Level 1) food quality and nutritional content; (Level 2) nutritional deficiencies; and (Level 3) morbidity and mortality. Level 1 simply describes the market basket in terms of its calories and nutrients. Level 2 compares level 1 to nutrient needs and accounts for variability, dietary supplements, and poisoning risk, and looks atout outcomes such as micronutrient deficiencies. Level 3 looks at how these nutrition gaps translate into anthropometry, capturing stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and underweight (low weight for age) outcomes, and illness, such as diarrhea, anemia, malaria, heart disease, as well as childhood mortality.
> 
> Levels 2 and 3 can be studied through either model-based approaches, drawing upon previously established relationships, or new multivariate regression analysis. Estimating a statistical relationship between nutrition intake and health outcomes is challenging because of the endogenous role of poverty. However, our approach provides the instrumental variables necessary for exposing the true risks driven by food production and nutrition. Using data from the Demographic Health Survey, we will develop new econometric relationships between Level 2 outcomes as a function of the market basket and Level 1 estimates and compare these to model-based estimates. Similarly, we will evaluate Level 3 by instrumenting Level 2 outcomes.
> 
> Seasonal and unexpected variability in nutrition also plays a key role in determining health outcomes.
> 
> We can further refine the at-risk populations, by accounting for food availability and poverty (WP4) and household features (DHS). When such a data on consumption are not available, we will use the actual fish harvesting and agricultural production, and their market distribution (both local markets and exports), to estimate the potential consumption across difference demographic, social and economic groups, using the methodology of Deaton and Zaidi (2002), FAO (2017) and Kébé (1998).
> 
> Finally, we will translate health risk estimates into (1) general policy recommendations and (2) metrics shared through the Food Security Futures Explorer. These outputs will be developed in consultation with the stakeholder groups under WP1.

> NOWASTING is a stakeholder-driven project, aimed at supporting small-holder farmers and fishers with salient data, accessible tools, and local capacity-building. The core stakeholder engagement activities will take place under WP1, and are described there. This document will focus out the outcomes envisioned from these meetings and the broader community engagement associated with the work. The aim is to address producer behaviors and co-develop new adaptation practices through decision-science approaches.
> WP6. Tools and Dataset Development (Lead: UD) (1 pg)
> All of the results produced by the project will be made available online, as downloadable datasets and visualizations. This will include: (1) spatiotemporal climate projections for the co-designed scenarios, (2) crop suitability and productivity metrics, (3) fisheries productivity and nutritional content, (4) biophysical production and profit potential for small-holders, (5) expected food production across the scenarios and local food availability, and (6) potential health outcomes under multiple public health responses. Future projections will be made at high resolution and through 2050.
> As part of this project, we aim to have thorough data collection and organization that we use in our research analysis, and provide ocean observations at the largest possible scale to effectively understand marine conservation. Ocean observations are crucial for making aware the societies in the countries that are part of our consortium about how their livelihoods can be affected (directly and indirectly) by the increasing pressures facing the oceans. This will be also useful for contributing further the relevant stakeholders’ abilities to predict and adapt to such pressures, especially those caused by climate change and human activity.
> 
> Because of the many dimensions of this data, users need tools to explore and understand it. The Food Security Futures Explorer will be the central tool for sharing data and visualizations, and will feature interactive tools to engage a broader audience and inform policy and behavior. The interface will be co-created to support stakeholders in developing resilience to production, nutrition, and health risks. The tool will contain extensive information about adverse environmental changes to serve as an early warning system and for evaluating stakeholder adaptation options. The Explorer will Integrate sustainability and economic outputs into the model to guide producers in decision-making.
> In addition to the collection of data, we will also present to the stakeholders and young scientists the modeling of the relationship between climate change, fishery biological and economic outcomes, and the implications for nutrition and health. This will enable communities to mitigate, anticipate and dynamically adapt to changing ocean boundaries.
