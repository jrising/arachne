**user**:
> My house has a leak. Should I call my insurance company?
**assistant**:
> Whether to call your insurance company about a leak in your house depends on a few factors:
> 
> 1. **Covered peril:** Check your homeowners insurance policy to see if the type of leak you're experiencing is covered. Policies typically cover sudden and accidental water damage but may exclude gradual leaks.
> 
> 2. **Deductible:** Depending on the cost of the damages, it might not be beneficial to file a claim if the repair cost is less than or near the deductible.
> 
> 3. **Policy impact:** Keep in mind that filing a claim can increase your future insurance premiums.
> 
> With these considerations, if you believe the home damage is severe and the repair costs will be higher than your deductible, it would be appropriate to contact your insurance company. 
> 
> Before making the call, document the damage. Take photographs or video, jot down details of what happened and when, and gather any related documents such as repair bills or estimates. These could be helpful during the claim process. 
> 
> If you can safely do so, take measures to prevent further damage, like catching dripping water in a bucket. But don't start major repair work until after the insurance adjuster has had a chance to inspect the damage.
> 
> Remember, your insurance company is there to help you recover from unexpected and significant financial losses related to your home. If you're unsure, it never hurts to call them and discuss your situation.
