**assistant**:
> When you use `subprocess.run` with `capture_output=True`, the standard output and standard error of the subprocess are captured to the `result.stdout` and `result.stderr` attributes of the returned result object. If `result` appears empty, ensure you're checking these attributes instead of `result` directly.

> ```python
> import subprocess
> 
> result = subprocess.run(['pytest', script_name], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
> 
> # Check the captured output
> output = result.stdout
> errors = result.stderr
> 
> print("Standard Output:\n", output)
> print("Standard Error:\n", errors)

> A few additional points to consider:
> 
> 1. **Ensure `script_name` is correctly specified:** If the script name is incorrect or the script does not exist in your working directory, `pytest` will not be able to run it, and you'll likely see some error messages in `result.stderr`.
> 
> 2. **Check for Exceptions:** If the `check=True` argument is used, `subprocess.run` will raise a `CalledProcessError` if the subprocess returns a non-zero exit status. In such a case, you can handle the error and inspect `e.stdout` and `e.stderr` as follows:
> 
>    ```python
>    import subprocess
> 
>    try:
>        result = subprocess.run(['pytest', script_name], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
>        output = result.stdout
>        errors = result.stderr
>    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
>        output = e.stdout
>        errors = e.stderr
>        print("Error Running Pytest:\n", errors)
> 
>    print("Standard Output:\n", output)
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Terminal-specific Output:** If you see output in your terminal but not when running through the `subprocess`, make sure there are no setup configurations in your shell (such as environment variables, pytest configuration files, or terminal settings) affecting the behavior that isn't replicated when the subprocess runs.
> 
> By checking these areas, you should be able to diagnose why your `subprocess` call isn't yielding the expected information in `result`.
