> What's an academic term for backward-looking, rather than thinking about future projections?
**assistant**:
> An academic term often used to describe a backward-looking perspective is "retrospective." This term is commonly contrasted with "prospective," which refers to forward-looking or future projections. In various academic fields, retrospective analysis refers to looking at past data or events to draw conclusions, understand patterns, or assess outcomes.

> Does that term fit your context, or do you need something more specific?
**user**:
> Hmm, I want something that includes present day. What other options are there?
**assistant**:
> In the context you've described, where a forward-looking perspective is contrasted with a backward-looking one while including the present day, a term commonly used is "cross-sectional." 
> 
> Cross-sectional analysis typically involves examining a snapshot of data or a situation at a specific point in time, without following the same subjects over time. This approach allows for a comparison of different variables or groups at a single point, incorporating both retrospective and present-day perspectives.
