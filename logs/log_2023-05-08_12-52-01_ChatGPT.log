> What is the PAGE IAM for climate economics?
**assistant**:
> It seems you are referring to the PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model, which is an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) used to study climate economics. Integrated Assessment Models are computational models that combine aspects of the Earth's climate system, human activities, and economic systems to analyze the potential impacts and policy implications of climate change.
> 
> The PAGE model, specifically, is designed to estimate the costs and benefits of various climate change policies by evaluating their impact on the global economy, ecosystems, and human health. Developed by Chris Hope at the University of Cambridge, the PAGE model has gone through several iterations since its inception, with each version incorporating updated scientific knowledge, economic data, and policy insights.
> 
> The PAGE model uses a probabilistic approach to estimate the range of potential outcomes from different climate change policies. It accounts for uncertainties in climate sensitivity, mitigation costs, adaptation strategies, and the valuation of various impacts. The model has been used to support policy analysis and decision-making processes at national and international levels.
