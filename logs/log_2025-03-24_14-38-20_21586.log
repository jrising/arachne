> I think I should organize all sharks and rays together, which makes me think I should organize the rest by location (demersals on up or something). What do you suggest?
**assistant**:
> Organizing your functional groups can indeed make the analysis more structured and potentially insightful. Here's a suggestion on how you can categorize them for better organization:
> 
> ### 1. Sharks and Rays
> - **Large Sharks (>=90 cm)**
> - **Small to Medium Sharks (<90 cm)**
> - **Large Rays (>=90 cm)**
> - **Small to Medium Rays (<90 cm)**
> 
> ### 2. Fish by Habitat
> #### Demersals (bottom dwellers)
> - **Large Demersals (>=90 cm)**
> - **Medium Demersals (30 - 89 cm)**
> - **Small Demersals (<30 cm)**
> 
> #### Pelagics (open water)
> - **Large Pelagics (>=90 cm)**
> - **Medium Pelagics (30 - 89 cm)**
> - **Small Pelagics (<30 cm)**
> 
> #### Others (specific association)
> - **Large Bathydemersals (>=90 cm)**
> - **Medium Bathydemersals (30 - 89 cm)**
> - **Small Bathydemersals (<30 cm)**
> 
> - **Large Bathypelagics (>=90 cm)**
> - **Medium Bathypelagics (30 - 89 cm)**
> - **Small Bathypelagics (<30 cm)**
> 
> - **Large Benthopelagics (>=90 cm)**
> - **Medium Benthopelagics (30 - 89 cm)**
> - **Small Benthopelagics (<30 cm)**
> 
> ### 3. Other Fish Types
> #### Reef-associated
> - **Large Reef Assoc. Fish (>=90 cm)**
> - **Medium Reef Assoc. Fish (30 - 89 cm)**
> - **Small Reef Assoc. Fish (<30 cm)**
> 
> #### Flatfishes
> - **Large Flatfishes (>=90 cm)**
> - **Small to Medium Flatfishes (<90 cm)**

> This structure allows you to see the distribution based on both size and ecological grouping. Grouping sharks and rays together emphasizes their ecological roles and similarities. Similarly, the habitat-based categorization for other fish provides a tidy overview of their environmental interactions. You might refine these categories further based on specific research needs or additional data dimensions you have.
