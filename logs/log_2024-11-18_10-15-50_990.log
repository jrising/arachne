**assistant**:
> Engaging current members of the DC Building Innovations Hub Advisory Committee and encouraging them to bring in new members requires a multi-pronged approach. 
> 
> Here are several steps that may be helpful:
> 
> 1. **Plan and Facilitate Engaging Meetings**
>    Hold regular meetings (either in-person or online), and make them exciting and rewarding. This could involve providing updates on recent innovations, debates about key issues, guest speakers, or brainstorming sessions for bringing in new members. The goal is to create a vibrant and engaging environment that members will want to share with others.
> 
> 2. **Clear Communication**
>    Keep members informed about the Hub's achievements, goals, and projects. This will give them stories to tell and reasons to engage others. Use a variety of communication channels - email newsletters, social media updates, or a dedicated web portal - to ensure everyone stays engaged and informed.
> 
> 3. **Member Recognition**
>    Recognise and celebrate member contributions. This gives members the sense that they are part of something meaningful and encourages them to involve others.
> 
> 4. **Networking**
>    Capitalize on the networks of current members. Encourage each member to bring a friend or colleague to the next meeting, or host a “friend-raising” event where members can invite potential new members.
> 
> 5. **Buddy System**
>    Implement a 'buddy system', where existing members pair up with new ones to help them get acclimated. This can encourage hesitant invitees to join, knowing they'll already have a relationship inside the advisory committee.
> 
> 6. **Personalised Outreach**
>    Approach potential members directly with personalised invitations. Current members can play a crucial role here by identifying individuals in their wider networks who would be valuable additions to the Hub.
> 
> 7. **Motivation**
>    Understand what motivates the prospective members. Whether it's prestige, desire to give back, professional development, or learning, cater to these motivations to attract more members.
> 
> Remember to maintain a diverse and inclusive committee; this balance will lead to a wider variety of thoughts and ideas, ultimately benefiting the DC Building Innovations Hub.
