> In a LASSO analysis (in R), I want to include a bunch of interactions between core variables. However, I am concerned that the LASSO will drop some of these core variables, just leaving their interactions, and that will reduce the interpretability of the result. Should I do anything to handle this?

> It's a valid concern that LASSO may drop some core variables while retaining their interactions, making the results less interpretable. One possible solution is to use group LASSO, a variant of LASSO that can enforce grouped selection of variables, such that either all variables within a group are included or excluded. In your case, you can define the main effects and their corresponding interactions as groups.

> # Load your data and create the design matrix X, response y, and groups
> # ...
> # Define your groups such that main effects and interactions are in the same group
> groups <- ...
> 
> # Apply group LASSO
> grplasso_result <- grpreg(X, y, groups)
> 
> # Display the results
> coef(grplasso_result)

This approach should help you maintain the interpretability of the results, as variables will be included or excluded in groups, providing a clearer understanding of the relationships between core variables and their interactions.
