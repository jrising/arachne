**user**:
> When I was a kid, I had a book that came with a tape about a boy who gets lost in an amusement park of dinosaurs. Why idea what that was?
**assistant**:
> Based on the information you provided, it sounds like you may be referring to the "Choose Your Own Adventure" book series. One of the books in the series, titled "Escape" by R.A. Montgomery, features a storyline where the protagonist gets lost in a dinosaur-themed amusement park. The series was quite popular and consisted of interactive stories where the reader could make decisions that determined the outcome of the story. If this matches your description, then "Escape" may be the book you are thinking of.
**user**:
> I'm pretty sure it was not a choose your own adventure.
**assistant**:
> I apologize for the incorrect assumption. Based on your clarification, it seems that the book you are referring to is not from the "Choose Your Own Adventure" series. To help you further, could you provide any additional details or descriptions about the book or the tape? This could include the approximate time period when you had the book, any specific characters or plot points you remember, or any other distinct features that may help narrow down its identification.
