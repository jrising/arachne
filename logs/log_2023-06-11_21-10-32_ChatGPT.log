> In an economics paper for which I am the sole author, I find it difficult to avoid saying that "I" go and do some piece of analysis. How can I avoid this? Should I use the general "we"?
**assistant**:
> Using "we" in a scientific or academic paper, even if you are the sole author, is a common practice. It's known as the "authorial we," and it's a way of suggesting that the author and the reader are investigating the issue together.

> However, there are other ways to avoid first-person pronouns in academic writing. Here are a few strategies:
> 
> 1. **Passive Voice**: While it's often recommended to use the active voice in writing, the passive voice can be useful in academic writing for avoiding personal pronouns. For example, instead of saying "I analyzed the data," you can say "The data was analyzed."
> 
> 2. **Nominalization**: This involves changing verbs into nouns. For example, instead of saying "I conducted an analysis," you can say "An analysis was conducted."
> 
> 3. **Use of "the researcher" or "the present study"**: For example, instead of saying "I found that...", you could say "The researcher found that..." or "The present study found that...".
> 
> 4. **Use of "one"**: This is a bit formal, but you can use "one" as a pronoun to avoid "I." For example, "One might conclude from the data that..."
> 
> 5. **Direct descriptions of the action**: Simply describe what's happening without referencing who is doing it. For example, instead of saying "I used a t-test to compare the groups," you could say "A t-test was used to compare the groups."
> 
> Remember that clarity should always be your top priority, so use these methods in a way that makes the text clear and easy to understand. Using "we" is often the simplest way to avoid using "I," but it's not the only way. Use the method that best fits your writing style and the conventions of your field.
