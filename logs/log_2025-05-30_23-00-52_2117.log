> I'm seeing some strange behavior from load_dotenv. I have a ".env" file, but when I just say `load_dotenv()`, it returns false. But I can get it to work if I say `load_dotenv(".env")`.
**assistant**:
> The behavior you're encountering with `load_dotenv()` could stem from the directory from which your script is being executed.
> 
> The `load_dotenv()` function searches for a `.env` file in the current working directory if no argument is provided. If the file is not found, it returns `False`, indicating that no environment was loaded. By specifying `load_dotenv(".env")`, you're explicitly telling it where to find the file.
> 
> Here are a few things you could check or try to resolve the issue:
> 
> 1. **Check the Working Directory**: Ensure that your script is running in the directory where the `.env` file is located. You can print the current working directory in your script using:
> 
>    ```python
>    import os
>    print(os.getcwd())
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Path Verification**: Verify that the `.env` file is indeed located in the directory you expect or consider using a relative or absolute path when calling `load_dotenv()`.
> 
> 3. **Filename**: Ensure the file is named exactly `.env` without typos or different extensions, which could cause it to be unrecognized.
> 
> 4. **Directory Structure**: If your script is nested inside other directories, you might need to traverse up to the base directory where the `.env` file is located or use a relative path accordingly.
> 
> If the above suggestions don't work, could you provide more context about your project structure or scripting environment? That might help pinpoint the issue more precisely.
