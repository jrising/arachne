> I am visiting Korea as an invited speaker. I think this means that I should bring gifts, but I'm not quite sure how many or at what price-point. There's the main person who's been managing our joint project, but I think there's someone more senior than him on the emails sometimes who I will probably meet. And maybe I should be bringing more presents, just out of caution, but I don't know. What is expected?
**assistant**:
> It's wonderful that you've been invited to speak in Korea! Bringing gifts is a thoughtful gesture and a part of Korean etiquette, especially when it comes to professional and formal settings. Here’s a structured approach to ensure you’re well-prepared:
> 
> ### Key Considerations:
> 
> 1. **Number of Gifts:**
>    - **Main Contact:** One for the project manager.
>    - **Senior Person:** One for the more senior person you've noticed in the emails.
>    - **Additional colleagues:** If you expect to meet a larger team or want to be cautious, consider bringing a couple of extra smaller gifts.
> 
> 2. **Type of Gifts:**
>    - **Main Gifts:** Something of good quality and thoughtful. Local products from your home country can be a good choice, such as specialty foods (like chocolates or teas), local crafts, or books.
>    - **Additional Smaller Gifts:** Items like candies, small souvenirs, or practical items (like nice stationery) are appreciated.
> 
> 3. **Price Point:**
>    - Gifts should be moderate – not too extravagant, but also not too cheap. A good range is $20-$50 for the main gifts, and $10-$20 for smaller gifts.
> 
> ### Suggested Gifts:
> - **For the Project Manager and Senior Person:**
>   - High-quality chocolates or gourmet food items
>   - Elegant notebooks or planners
>   - Local wine or liquor (if culturally appropriate and acceptable)
>   - A small piece of art or craft from your home area
> 
> - **For Additional Colleagues:**
>   - Local candies or snacks in pretty packaging
>   - Keychains or small trinkets with cultural significance
>   - Practical items like nice pens
> 
> ### Presentation:
> - Wrap the gifts nicely. Koreans appreciate good presentation and it adds to the thoughtfulness of the gesture.
> - If you have time, handwritten thank-you notes can accompany the gifts to add a personal touch.
> 
> ### Cultural Sensitivity:
> - Avoid gifts with numbers 4 or 9 as they are considered unlucky in Korean culture.
> - Be cautious of giving knives or scissors, as they symbolize cutting off a relationship.
> 
> ### Summary:
> Prepare 3-5 gifts with one or two larger, more thoughtful items for key individuals and several smaller, yet nice, items for additional colleagues. This should cover you well and ensure your gesture is appreciated.
> 
> Safe travels, and I’m sure your visit will be rewarding both professionally and culturally!
