> A line from an ancient Greek poet mentions Theseus as "but a youth in his first prime". Did the Greeks have a conception of people having more than one prime in their lives?

> While there isn't a concrete, documented age-old Greek concept of having multiple "primes" of life as understood by us today, the idea of different stages of life each having their unique value and distinction isn't foreign to ancient Greek thought. The poet's reference to Theseus as a "youth in his first prime" might be more a poetic way to phrase his young, virile status, highlighting the impressive feats he accomplished at such a young age. 
> 
> Traditional ancient Greek society recognized several life stages, reflecting in their mythological narratives, social structure, and philosophical discussions. They acknowledged youth (typically associated with vigor, courage, and beauty), adulthood (often tied to wisdom and leadership), and old age (have connotations of experience and sage wisdom). However, each of these life stages probably wouldn't be termed "primes," but they were all valued in their unique ways.
> 
> In conclusion, while the exact concept of multiple "primes" as we understand it today may not have been prevalent in ancient Greek society, their recognition of different valuable life stages suggests a similar understanding. The reference to Theseus as being in his "first prime" would be appreciated in this broader understanding.
