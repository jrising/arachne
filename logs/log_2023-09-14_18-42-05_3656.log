> My research focuses on the quantitative, interdisciplinary study of climate impacts and the water-energy-food system, with the aim of understanding and managing complex, social-environmental systems under global environmental change.
> I am dedicated to developing quantitative and integrated approaches that provide valuable insights for researchers and policymakers, contributing to the transition towards economic and environmental sustainability.

> \subsection*{Interdisciplinarity in climate risks}
> 
> A key component of my research aims to bridge of gaps that exist between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics to study the economic risks of climate change. I have worked to narrow the gap between these fields through grant-funded workshops and
> publications aimed at opening new avenues of collaboration
> \cite{piontek2021integrated, rising2022challenges, rising2022missing}.
> 
> My collaboration under the Climate Impact Lab (CIL, \url{https://impactlab.org/}), has been instrumental in quantifying climate risks. I developed the analytical engine behind the influential American Climate Prospectus (ACP) \cite{hsiang2017estimating}, and have since developed ground-breaking new approaches to assess climate vulnerability and adaptation costs, across multiple sectors (health, energy, agriculture and labor productivity)\cite{rode2021estimating, carleton2022valuing}.
> 
> %Rapid progress on climate impacts requires new tools-- like my CIL projection system-- which help researchers with the necessary sophisticated analysis. The ACP relied on an innovative online tool I developed for performing econometric meta-analyses (\url{http://dmas.berkeley.edu/}), designed to allow any researcher to expand the database of economic risks.  Drawing from my experience with the CIL's climate risk evaluation and my engagement with the community for detailed-processing modeling \cite{ciscar2019assessing}, I have developed a method to estimate damages across multiple risks that enables rapid, decentralized expansion of the collection of risks \cite{rising2022missing}.
> %I have translated these solutions into public tools and materials to facilitate climate impact projections more widely, including a tutorial under review at the Journal of Open Source Education (\url{https://climateestimate.net/}).
> 
> As a demonstration of these methods, I have produced the first plausibly-comprehensive estimate of the costs of climate change, by combining a large collections of risk models and an estimate of missing risks for the United Kingdom. This work was released as a public report, emphasizing comprehensiveness, spatial inequality, and risk \cite{rising2022will}. I am now preparing an extension of this work for academic publication, incorporating expert elicitation, econometric estimates, process-based models, and spill-over effects. The approach also provides a template for performing high-quality climate risk assessments in other countries, for which I am pursuing funding.
> 
> \subsection*{Complexity and integrated modeling}
> 
> I also study how theoretical issues from complexity science make an empirical
> difference for social and environmental policy. This research focuses on the role of interactions across space (cross-boundary flows \cite{ramesh2019small}, climate inequality \cite{carleton2022valuing}, neighbor-dependence \cite{taylor2021tipping}), as well as cross-scale
> emergence\cite{rising2017flexible} and path
> dependence\cite{dumas2016political}.
> 
> To study these for water and agriculture, I have developed the America's Water Analysis, Synthesis, and Heuristics (AWASH) hydroeconomic model, incorporating forward-looking
> spatiotemporal optimization of resources and
> infrastructure investment \cite{rising2020decision}. This model can provide better insight into water stress accounting for hydrology and infrastructure \cite{rising2022importance}, as well as new investment policies. With a new comprehensive description of inter-basin transfers \cite{siddik2023interbasin}  and state-level water use dataset \cite{josset2019us}, this model has the potential to change our understanding of resource conflicts and environmental footprints and to improved management strategies across the United States \cite{brelsford2020developing}.
> 
> I am also a key contributor to integrated assessment modeling (BC-IAM) to
> support climate policy. I am the lead developer for the PAGE model, after co-leading the translation of the model into an open-source framework \cite{moore2018mimi}. Through a paper led by my Masters students, PAGE now has, 
> perhaps, the most sophisticated representation of empirically-derived damages, adaptation, and climate variability across the CB-IAMs \cite{kikstra2021social}. 
> I am currently expanding the PAGE model to country-level resolution, to study the role of inequality and national adaptation.
> I also helped develop a novel IAM, which assimilates
> all research on economic consequences of climate
> tipping points \cite{dietz2021economic}. We have a working paper further expanding this model to study the potential benefit of rapid methane action.

**assistant**:
> Your research statement is well-written with no grammatical errors or confusing statements. However, there are a few minor suggestions I have to enhance clarity and flow:
> 
> 1. In the first paragraph, consider starting the sentence with "I aim to understand and manage complex" instead of using "with the aim of" for a clearer connection between your research focus and the goal.
> 
> 2. In the second paragraph, the sentence "A key component of my research aims to bridge of gaps" should be revised to "A key component of my research aims to bridge the gaps." Additionally, you could consider rephrasing "the gap between these fields through grant-funded workshops and publications aimed at opening new avenues of collaboration" to "by organizing grant-funded workshops and publishing articles that foster collaboration between these fields." This change provides a more active and concise description of your actions.
> 
> 3. Towards the end of the second paragraph, you might want to clarify the acronym "CIL" by mentioning that it refers to the Climate Impact Lab.
> 
> 4. In the paragraph discussing your work on climate change costs, you could rephrase "combination of models and an estimate of missing risks for the United Kingdom" to "combination of models and an estimate of previously unaccounted risks" for brevity and clarity.
> 
> 5. In the paragraph on complexity and integrated modeling, you might consider rephrasing "state-level water use dataset" to "dataset on state-level water use" for clarity.
> 
> These are just suggestions to improve the overall clarity and flow of your research statement. Feel free to modify and adapt them as per your preferences.
