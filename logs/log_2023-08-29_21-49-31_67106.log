> Can you represent this information in a paragraph for the report? Start by describing the types of freight and tanker contents typical of Delaware. Note that some ships pass through Delaware waters, but most enter the Bay. Note that hazardous contents are also observed, for both cargo and tanker ships. Talk about the average number of employees and a few key statistics.
**assistant**:
> Delaware marine waters support a myriad of shipping activities, among which are coastal freight transport, deep sea freight transport, and tanker operations. Coastal freight transport often revolves around the carriage of domestic goods such as food items, construction materials, and machinery. Notably, coastal freight transport enterprises in the area were staffed by an average of 34 employees between 2011 and 2019, with minima and maxima of 30 and 38 respectively. Correspondingly, the number of establishments varied between 1 and 5 with an average of 3.
> 
> The scope of deep-sea freight transport, on the other hand, encompasses transoceanic operations, often ferrying heavyweight, bulky items, and containers globally. This sector of shipping managed an average of 98 staff members persistently from 2011 through 2019, serviced by between 1 and 4 establishments.
> 
> Tanker ships operations largely focus on the movement of liquid bulk materials, typically comprising chemicals, crude oil, or liquefied natural gas. While a smaller number of these vessels were observed in comparison to cargo ships—approximately 3474 versus 7571—they remain integral in facilitation of international trade. It bears noting that hazardous contents are occasionally transported in both cargo and tanker vessels, underscoring the importance of diligent oversight and proper safety measures. While 22% of cargo ships and 8% of tanker ships simply pass through Delaware waters, the majority still enter the Delaware Bay, demonstrating the undeniable stature of Delaware as a principal maritime hub.
