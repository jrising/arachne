**assistant**:
> In the United States, when someone loses their job and their associated health insurance, there's often a gap in coverage until they can be added to another health care plan. During this gap, medical expenses can be a significant concern. Here are a few options and protections available:
> 
> 1. **COBRA**: The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) allows individuals to continue their employer-sponsored health insurance for a limited time after job loss, usually up to 18 months. The individual pays the full premium, which can be costly, but it provides continuity of coverage.
> 
> 2. **Special Enrollment Period**: Losing your job and health insurance qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) in the Health Insurance Marketplace. This allows you to enroll in a new health insurance plan outside of the usual open enrollment period.
> 
> 3. **Medicaid**: Depending on income and family size, you might qualify for Medicaid, a state and federally funded program providing health coverage to eligible low-income individuals. Eligibility varies by state, but it's worth exploring to cover the gap.
> 
> 4. **Short-term Health Insurance**: These plans can provide a temporary solution, though they often offer limited coverage and benefits compared to comprehensive health plans. They're generally more affordable, but be cautious about exclusions for pre-existing conditions or specific treatments.
> 
> Medical expenses incurred during a gap in coverage generally fall under your responsibility unless you have coverage through one of these means. Always review your options carefully, considering the costs and coverage details before deciding on the best path forward.
