**user**:
> I have N distributions, characterized by their several quantile values (only their quantiles-- I do not have other information about them). I would like to construct a mixture distribution from these. What can I say about that mixture distribution?
**assistant**:
> Given N distributions characterized by their quantile values, you can construct a mixture distribution using a mixture model. However, a variety of information will be obscured or less certain, given the only available input is a series of quantiles. Here's what you can say about such a mixture distribution:
> 
> 1. **Central Tendency**: The mean, median, and mode of the mixture distribution will depend on the relative mixing proportions of the N distributions and their individual centric tendencies.
> 
> 2. **Spread**: The overall spread or dispersion of the mixture distribution will similarly depend on the spreads of individual distributions and their mixing proportions. But due to the limitation of information, the quantile-based spreads may not capture all the nuances of the actual spread of the distributions.
> 
> 3. **Tail Behavior**: The tail behavior of the mixture distribution could follow the tail behavior of the "heaviest" tailed distribution in the mixture, assuming you have enough quantiles to adequately describe tail behavior. If the tail behaviors of your component distributions are significantly different and you only sampled quantiles around the center, your tail information might be significantly off.
> 
> 4. **Quantiles**: Speaking of quantiles, these can be calculated for the mixture distribution by assigning weights according to the mixture proportions in the mixture model for the component distributions. However, this is based on the assumption that the mixing proportions are known, which might not be the case.
> 
> 5. **Limitations**: Importantly, even with the quantile information and the derived mixture distribution, we have to remember that we are operating under certain limitations. Detailed shape, modes, and tails of the distribution will be less accurately captured by quantiles unless you have a relatively dense collection of quantiles for each distribution. Mixtures of distributions with dramatically different shapes, where the quantiles fail to capture the complexity of the distributions, will be poorly represented.
> 
> Remember, with a limited number of quantile values, there is a large degree of uncertainty about the mixture distribution, particularly if those quantiles do not adequately sample the full range of behavior of the component distributions. 
> 
> Though creating the mixture distribution in this way can give you an idea about the potential mixture distribution's behavior, there may be multiple mixtures with very different behaviors but a similar series of quantiles. So any conclusions drawn from this analysis must consider this inherent uncertainty.
