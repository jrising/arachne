**user**:
> I see that Philadelphia has two active meeting houses in central Philly: Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia and Central Philadelphia Monthly Meeting. I can't distinguish between them from their website, but I assume that there are differences. Are there underlying differences between these groups?
**assistant**:
> Yes, there can indeed be differences between different Quaker "Monthly Meetings", even if they are in the same geographic area. The "Monthly Meeting" terminology originates from the traditional Quaker practice of congregating for business meetings on a monthly basis.
> 
> It seems that both Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia (also known as the Race Street Friends Meeting) and Central Philadelphia Monthly Meeting (CPMM) are both located in Central Philadelphia and are part of the larger Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. However, the two Meetings likely have differences in their community cultures, styles of worship, demographics, and social concerns, among other factors.
> 
> The differences may be nuanced and not immediately visible on their websites, so the best way to understand the unique atmosphere of each Meeting is to visit them. Friends' meetings place a high value on direct, personal spiritual experience, and such nuances are often best appreciated through participation. You might want to consider attending a Monthly Meeting at each location when possible, and see which one resonates more with your beliefs and expectations.
> 
> You can also reach out to each Meeting's "Clerk", a representative role akin to a congregational leader, with your specific queries. They would be more than happy to clarify any confusions along with providing more specific information relevant to their Meeting community.
