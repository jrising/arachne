> In order to reach its net-zero goals in the coming decades, the United States is making significant investments across a variety of clean energy technologies, and re-designing policies to address barriers to deployment of these clean energy technologiesy. Many academic researchers across the earth sciences, environmental and materials engineering, and energy system models spaces are engaged in uUnderstanding whichwhat technologies will supportaid in reaching these goals, who will benefit or be harmed by different approaches, and what the varying climate and environmental impacts of our decisions will have is the goal of many academic researchers across the earth science, environmental and materials engineering, and energy system models spaces. A key challenge for iIntegrating this research into the policy environment so that it is truly used to inform an equitable transition that accounts for the best state of science, is the communication divide can be difficult without improved communication across the divide of between scientists/engineers and policymakers.

> The academic process of research process, and paper-writing, often based on collecting evidence and providing our best analysis of the qualitative or quantitative data, , that is often the root of academic research goals is not always in line with the best way to provide information to decision makers. As part of During a week-long bootcamp in Washington D.C., early-career academics engaged in discussions with policy-makers and aides a theme across multiple ranks, departments, and divisions. A key theme that emerged was the desire for storytelling, with material closely targeted for something that is connected to the mission of a given department, the constituents of a representative, or athe  technology that is the subject of an ongoing legislative processbeing investigated. 
> Researchers in technical and quantitative spaces or in traditional academic settings can often find their typical scientific approach, and or the required outputs of their position, at odds with the outputs that are most desired within the policy environment. Pulling a few key sentences away from a technical paper and turning it into a story that will attract the attention of the most relevant congress member or department is not a skill set academicswe were  are trained with. On the other side, as scientists, it is concerning to see that decisions can be made based on the best story rather than the most comprehensivecompelling evidence. Within the climate and energy space, as early career scientists, we aim to inform policy, which can require building long-term relationships, and being able to produce fast results and convincing story-lines that pertain to individuals or specific departments. In contrast, the academic structure for early career scientists asks us to move institutions and locations as we complete a PhD, enter a postdoc, and move on to more permanent positions. Tenure does not account for a number of policies you have been cited in or influenced, but rather numbers of publications, coursework taught, and service done. 
> How DC vs. Academia Work
> Academic research aims to stimulate novel discoveries by investigating new lines of thought using a systematic approach that yields reproducible yet novel results. Academics undergo years of general preparation on how to effectively perform systematic research and then years of preparation to become experts in their chosen field(s). Theoretically at least. In practice, researchers, more often than not, attempt to identify lines of inquiry that are likely to be funded based on previous funding patterns and current “hot” research topics. Then they attempt to use their training and expertise to build on those existing themes in a novel way. Thus, recently academic researchers seem to respond to new trends rather than lead them which is evident in the new hot topics like generative AI. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it can add an important “academic” perspective to the zeitgeist since the systematic approach is still used and applies rigor to new research directions. However, in practice only academics with a similar background read let alone review or critique other publicly available work. Therefore, academics can be said to add a systematically rigorous and publicly verified (academically at least) perspective to ideas, information, and new themes in the zeitgeist. 
> 
> In contrast, policy makers aim to create policy that delivers for their constituents. They are less worried about processes and their tools tend to be much less systematic and more relationship-based. They are more focused on how policy can be implemented and the cost (usually political) to do so. They are somewhat worried about the effect of policy at least in the short term but perhaps more worried about the perceived effect of a policy as that will be what enacts a potent political cost. So, unlike academics they are less focused on producing policy that is systematically rigorous and academically verified but policy that produces political benefit at minimal political cost.
> 
> However, even with these differences there are remarkable similarities. Academics are also reactive to emerging trends as illustrated by the boom of research in generative AI. Furthermore, researchers in particular areas generally know each other or know of each other so their work shares common themes and techniques similar to how policy makers use their relationships to shape policy. Finally, academics despite the protections afforded by tenure are also responsive to societal and sometimes political pressures to research certain topics and to try to find answers from a certain perspective. 
> 
> Nonetheless, academia has much to offer society and policy makers, as was traditionally the case, by providing a systematically rigorous approach to a given perspective which includes a long term focus on potential effects. Academics also bring expertise to given topics and should be aware of the current trends and what current research says about those trends. Lastly, academics can stress test different policy ideas to identify the likely short, medium, and long term effects. 
> 
> Academia seems to have lost the trust of the public and now ideas accepted by the majority of academics, are frequently not accepted by the majority of the public. This means that policy ideas that derive from academic research might be politically unpalatable even if they are correct. Thus, academics have fallen out of favor with policy makers since the political cost of enacting academically preferable solutions can be high. Nevertheless, academics even without providing prescriptive solutions can provide value by informing policy makers of the basic principles of an idea (i.e. providing their expertise), highlighting both recent academic scientific research and public opinion (which is another field of academic research) on a given topic, and stress testing the impact of policies both on a system (e.g., clean energy funding) and on the public’s interest in topics. This view marries the systematic rigor of academia with societal impacts and provides policy makers the complete view including potential public opinion. 
> 
> No longer can academics prescribe solutions because “that is what the science backs” instead they must present both the scientific information along with impacts on the system and people’s perception of the impacts on them in order to be useful to policymakers.
> 
> [Erick to add themes of Prescriptive vs. scenario based solutions.]
> 
> Succinctly, academics must shy away from prescriptive solutions that policy makers can simply cut and paste and then justify as having the backing of science. The general erosion of trust in public institutions, the perception of academia as inaccessible and partisan (i.e., the ivory tower), and the lack of accountability when the general research zeitgeist was wrong has soured the public and by extension policy makers on “solutions” provided by academics. Nonetheless, academics are regularly employed by industry, government, and the general public to provide expertise on subjects and to evaluate potential impacts of different decisions. In other words, general expertise and scenario-based investigations are still very much valued. Thus, the perceived paternalistic prescription of solutions must be replaced with policy maker / public led scenario generation and academics simply provide their expertise and evaluate potential impacts of those scenarios. Thus our role is more supportive rather than leading, more guidance than direction.
> We argue that policy briefs can re-align the incentives of academia and policy makers, as was the case historically, by rewarding academics with publications in emerging areas that are used by policy makers who could potentially support applications to future funding opportunities. However, these policy briefs must have an impact evaluation rather than solution-prescription focus in order to more effectively transfer academic research to policy makers in a politically palatable way.
> 
> 
> Random Aside
> Nonetheless it is important to realize that there are multiple systematic approaches, not just the scientific method as popularly understood. For example, engineers often use heuristics to achieve a goal rather than test a hypothesis using the scientific method. So, a systematic approach for a group of academics can be dramatically different than another group but all groups attempt to ensure their accuracy with peer review and by publicly publishing their work so anyone can verify or critique it.

> The relationship between climate and energy research and policymaking is complex and evolving, with a growing emphasis on the integration of research into practical policy development. 
> Prior studies have highlighted important tools that are expected to support policy-making through scientific research. For example, DeCarolis et al. (2020) emphasize the pivotal role of open-source tools in enhancing transparency and collaboration in energy system modeling research work, which is essential for crafting adaptable and inclusive energy policies. These tools promote cost savings and innovation, while fostering more accessible decision-making processes that support evidence-based policies. On the other hand, policies also influence modeling in terms of data, assumptions, and study scope (Süsser et al., 2021). In addition to research tools, policy briefs have also proven to be an effective knowledge transfer tool, bridging the gap between research and policymaking by offering easy-to-understand and credible insights (Arnautu et al., 2021). The use of policy briefs also allows the interaction between policymakers and scientists, encouraging the policymakers to attentively consider the policy brief and provide feedback.
> Despite increasing academic research on climate change and energy, this type of research is facing challenges from different perspectives, out of which disseminating research findings to policymakers and the general public requires much time, effort, and skill. Hanna et al. (2022) suggest that policy-focused workshops would help scholars to directly interact with government officials to sharpen research questions and seek collaboration opportunities. However, guidance on more effective communication between scientists and policymakers that better facilitates evidence-based and transparent policy-making processes is still very limited. To fill this gap and ensure that scientific findings can be effectively integrated into actionable climate policies,  we discuss xxxx. 
> 
> To address critical energy and climate issues, policy-makers need to make informed decisions. Without scientific evidence and guidance, such informed decisions are often difficult, leading to ineffective or uncertain policies (Khomsi et al., 2024). In turn, policy uncertainty over energy and climate can severely hinder the transition to clean energy. This is particularly relevant to the United States, where climate policy uncertainty has been triggered by the initial withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and subsequent re-commitment (Borozan and Pirgaip). 
> 
> Over the last three decades, significant efforts have been made to translate scientific work on energy and climate into policy action (Tangney, 2022). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has emerged as a key source of scientific guidance, effectively reducing the communication gap between academia and policy-makers (Offutt, 1993). Recent examples of scientific evidence influencing policy include work by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, which informed governmental decisions on updating the social cost of carbon and expanding transmission lines for clean energy growth. However, communication gaps remain, and scientific evidence is often only partially reflected in policy actions. Despite the vast amount of academic research, there are limited examples of its conversion into policy. Even when government agencies receive extensive scientific information, there is little knowledge of how this information is used in policy design (Head, 2015). 
> 
> To close existing gaps, a key question that emerges is how can academic evidence i) become more relevant to policy-makers, and; ii) be better communicated to policy-makers? Tangney (2022) suggests combining elements from two models of expertise: the “linear model”, which assumes that impartial academic expertise directly drives rational policy-making, and the “co-production model,” where academic experts and policy-makers collaborate as equal partners. For either model to work, modern energy and climate research should engage with pressing problems. Sovacool et al. (2020) and Matos et al. (2022) propose future research directions, including integrating behavioral change with technological innovation, exploring the socio-technical aspects of the energy transition, examining the role of digital technology, understanding the politics of design and resilience, and addressing equity and justice issues. These directions highlight the need for interdisciplinary teams to produce policy-relevant work. Academics are often trained in a single discipline and publish in specialized outlets, but most energy and climate policy issues are multifaceted, involving technological, political, economic and social dimensions, and therefore require integrated knowledge from various disciplines.
> 
> Whether a linear, or a co-production, or any other model of collaboration between academics and policy-makers is followed, the second part of the key question remains critical. Toft (2018) notes that policy-makers’ needs often differ from what academics deliver. Policy-makers require good (not perfect) answers and clear predictions quickly. They need specific, timely, and actionable recommendations, not generalizations. Often, they are not trained to understand complex statistical models and their outputs. While academics are uniquely positioned to identify solutions to improve current and future policy, they are not necessarily trained to communicate with policy audiences. To bridge these gaps, we suggest an improved approach to delivering policy briefs produced by interdisciplinary teams of academics.

> One option is to: (Advocating for one thing while weighing a series of options.) We propose to create a website that hosts climate-energy research briefs for policymakers. The purpose of this webpage is to connect the output of researchers to policymakers through 2-page briefs written in plain language. Teams of researchers from interdisciplinary backgrounds in the climate and energy space will contribute. Research briefs allow for more efficient communication between researchers, journalists, and policymakers. Research briefs allow scientists to reframe their motivation and findings in the language of policymakers based on timely events and current contexts. The briefs may include specific anecdotes that capture policymakers' attention that would typically not be included in peer-reviewed literature. Short and medium-term implications of the findings may be included when typically only long-term implications would be included in the literature. Generalizable findings of the peer-reviewed publication will be delivered to the policymaker but in language targeted for them. We will recommend distilling these findings as three key points for decision-makers in a template research brief that we will provide.
> 
> During our time at the Bootcamp, we noted a significant gap between peer-reviewed literature and the decision-making by policymakers. Several of the members we met with in D.C. explained that the lack of time and expertise to read entire academic papers were part of the barriers to their access. This means that some decisions that are made may not have been based on the research and work that is publicly funded, which is often proposed and completed with the goal of informing policy. We need better policy-oriented outputs from research, and we believe a research brief web platform is a way to put our perspective into action.
> 
> Conclusion (needs better name)
> 
> Several barriers currently undermine the role of science in policy-making. A major challenge is the misalignment of incentives between academics and policy-makers. Academic researchers are not recognized for their contributions to policy, and are discouraged from investing time and resources to understand the political economy behind policy change. At the same time, policy-makers are only tangentially interested in reaping any benefits that scientific results may have for their work. Policy-makers are accountable to their constituencies, so disinterested improvements in efficiency are rarely useful to their work.
> 
> However, most scientific work in energy and climate has direct benefits for interested parties, and scientists are often motivated to go beyond their academic demands to improve outcomes in the real world. The pathway for scientific results to improve policy-making can be significantly improved by addressing the potential for (1) framing and relevance, (2) storytelling, and (3) learning.
> 
> The results from academic studies can be relevant to many different audiences. By reframing results for each audience, and recognizing the differing needs of households, workers, firms, governing institutions, and politicians, a significant barrier to engaging with academic results can be removed. Audience-specific framing is not sufficient though. Politicians operate in a world of individuals, where even identifying the benefits to a single person can be powerful. We call this step "storytelling", and it makes the results concrete to the political process. As one federal staffer said, "Stories are the currency of DC."
> 
> Finally, the process of developing a relevant framing and a concrete story is a learned skill. It is also a skill that develops hand-in-hand with relationships between academics and policy-makers. The long-term reduction in barriers between science and policy requires an iterative learning process, where scientists can receive feedback on their attempts, and people involved in the policy-process can seek out long-term relationships with researchers who have the potential for impactful work.
