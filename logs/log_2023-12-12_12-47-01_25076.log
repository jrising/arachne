> Reasons for a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware
> The global community is grappling with an escalating challenge: environmental degradation and
> resource depletion. Among these concerns, the issue of illegal small-scale mining, commonly
> known as “galamsey” in Ghana, has emerged as a critical environmental and socio-economic
> problem. As a passionate advocate for addressing the adverse effects of galamsey on my
> homeland, I am driven to pursue a graduate degree in Environmental Economics at the University
> of Delaware. In this essay, I will articulate my motivations for selecting this program, elucidate
> how I intend to tackle the galamsey issue through my studies, and explain why the University of
> Delaware is my chosen institution. Galamsey has emerged as one of Ghana’s most pressing
> environmental and economic challenges. This informal and illicit small-scale mining practice
> involves the extraction of precious minerals, particularly gold, without adherence to
> environmental regulations and sustainable mining practices. The repercussions of galamsey are
> multifaceted, spanning from deforestation and water pollution to land degradation and health
> hazards. Despite government efforts and policies, this issue continues to persist, underscoring
> the necessity for innovative and sustainable solutions.
> My motivation to study Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware is deeply rooted
> in my ardent desire to make a meaningful contribution to resolving the galamsey problem in
> Ghana. This program is renowned for its interdisciplinary approach, blending economics,
> environmental science, and policy analysis. Such an approach is imperative for a comprehensive
> understanding of and effective responses to complex environmental challenges like galamsey. The
> program aligns perfectly with my academic and career goals. The curriculum not only delves into
> the theoretical foundations of environmental economics but also places a strong emphasis on
> practical applications and policy development. This equilibrium between theory and practice will
> equip me with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively address intricate environmental
> challenges like galamsey. Furthermore, the University of Delaware boasts a distinguished faculty
> specializing in Environmental Economics, prominently featuring Prof. Leah Palm-Forster. Her
> research focus within Environmental and Natural Resource Economics closely aligns with my own
> interests. I initiated contact with Prof. Palm-Forster to express my eagerness for mentorship, and
> I am pleased to report her enthusiastic response, indicating her anticipation of reviewing my
> admission application. Her guidance and insights, and those of other distinguished faculty, are
> bound to prove invaluable as I endeavor to formulate effective strategies for addressing the
> environmental and socio-economic repercussions of galamsey.
> Through my enrollment in this graduate program, I aim to attain a comprehensive grasp of the
> underlying economic drivers fueling illegal small-scale mining and the attendant environmental
> ramifications. My intention is to harness advanced economic tools and methodologies to evaluate
> the true costs and benefits associated with illegal mining activities. This in-depth analysis will serve
> as the foundation for crafting innovative policy interventions designed not only to deter illegal
> mining but also to foster sustainable alternatives for affected communities.

**assistant**:
> Dear Charles Lwanga Siewobr,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your motivations and aspirations for addressing the critical issue of illegal small-scale mining in Ghana. Your passion for environmental economics and policy intervention is impressive.
> 
> In your case, I believe the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware is indeed the most appropriate program. As you correctly pointed out, this program provides an interdisciplinary approach, blending environmental science, economics, and policy analysis - all crucial domains to tackle the complex issue you are passionate about.
> 
> However, do keep in mind that funding is always a constraint for our programs. If your research aligns with my areas of expertise - climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling - I would encourage you to mention me in your statement of purpose. This will make you a more attractive candidate should funding become available.
> 
> I recommend you apply by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funds. Your background and dedication could make significant contributions to our program and global sustainability. As you are considering this program, I also suggest reaching out to Prof. Leah Palm-Forster, whom you mentioned you have already contacted, for more information on funding and support.
