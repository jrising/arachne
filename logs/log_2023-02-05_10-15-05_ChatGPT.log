> Yes, the Huns, a nomadic people originating from Central Asia, did invade China. During the Northern and Southern dynasties period (386-589 AD), the Xiongnu, a tribe of nomadic people similar to the Huns, frequently raided and invaded China. The Xiongnu were eventually incorporated into the Northern Wei dynasty (386-534 AD).
