> I have grey poupon  mustard that says it expired 5 months ago. is it so good?
**assistant**:
> Like many condiments, Grey Poupon mustard doesn't become harmful after its expired date but it may start to lose its flavor after the "best by" date. 
> 
> The "best by" or "use by" date is about quality, not safety. When properly stored, the shelf life of mustard past its best by date is approximately 1-2 years. 
> 
> So, if it has only been 5 months, your mustard should still be good to use. However, you should check for signs of spoilage such as an off smell, a change in appearance, or mold: throw it out if you observe any of these. 
> 
> Still, the best approach is to taste a small amount: if it still has its typical flavor, feel free to use it.
> 
> Please remember this information should not replace the advice of a medical or food safety professional.
> 
> If in doubt, go with the adage, "When in doubt, throw it out."
