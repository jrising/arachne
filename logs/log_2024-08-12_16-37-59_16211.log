> In Plots for Julia, how can I make gaps in a time series line? There are regions of the x-axis where I don't want to show the line.
**assistant**:
> To create gaps in a time series plot using the Plots.jl package in Julia, you can insert `NaN` values into your data where you want the line to be disconnected. The plotting function will automatically skip over these `NaN` values, resulting in a gap.
> 
> Here is an example:
> 
> ```julia
> using Plots
> 
> # Example data
> x = 1:10
> y = [1, 2, 3, NaN, NaN, NaN, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # NaNs will create a gap in the plot
> 
> # Plot with gaps
> plot(x, y, label="Line with Gaps")
> ```
> 
> In this example, `NaN` values are inserted into the `y` data at the positions where you want to create gaps. Adjust the indices of `NaN` values according to where you want the gaps to appear in your actual data.
