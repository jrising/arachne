**user**:
> What port would the Pequod have sailed from on Nantucket in Moby Dick?
**assistant**:
> The Pequod would have departed from the port town of Nantucket itself. In the 19th century, when "Moby-Dick" is set, Nantucket was a leading whaling hub, featuring one of the busiest whaling ports in the world. The name "Nantucket" was even used interchangeably to refer both to the island and the main port town on the island. There was only one primary harbor, so any ship, including the Pequod, setting sail from Nantucket would have left from there.
