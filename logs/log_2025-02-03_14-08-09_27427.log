> PROPOSAL: SPATIAL AND TIME EVOLUTION OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FOOD PRODUCTION – NUTRITION – HUMAN HEALTH UNDER THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
> 1.	Overview and Objectives
> The effects of climate change on the value chain (VC) in the food and agriculture industry, and their subsequent relevance for human food consumption (nutritious, high quality, affordable and accessible) and health, remain understudied and poorly understood. This project will fill this knowledge gap by developing and presenting a geospatial analysis and evaluation of the structure and human nutrition-health implications of the food industry in the United States (US). The project will expand this knowledge by quantifying current and future effects of climate change on the VC of the food systems, and estimating the consequences to food-security and human health.
> FAO et al. (2024) define food security as having four dimensions: availability of, access to and utilization of food, and the stability of the mentioned three dimensions. A VC comprises different levels of activities, from bringing a product or service from its conception (farmers who grow crops and livestock) to its end use (final consumers of the final products). In addition, it includes activities of businesses and people in the middle of the VC responsible for adding value to the industry such as processing, transporting, storing, and packaging food, as well as distributing and providing food services (USAID, 2008; Willett et al., 2019; Rockström et al., 2023; Zanello et al., 2024). Thus, VCs involve human interactions and decision-making, and how humans transfer or exchange products, money, knowledge, technology, and information.
> In 2023, 47.4 million people in the US lived in food-insecure households. Among all food-insecure households in 2023, 36.1 percent were households with children (Rabbitt et al. 2024). Food-insecure children are likely at an increased risk for a variety of negative health outcomes (Dunifon and Kowaleski-Jones (2003) Gundersen and Kreider (2009), Metallinos-Katsaras et al. (2012), Cook and Frank (2008), Miller et al. (2022)). On the other hand, states in the US that are highly agriculture dependent are significantly different from each other with respect to the market value of their crops and livestock. Furthermore, some states with high product market values have citizens with suboptimal levels of food security. It is still unknown how such attributes will be transformed spatially and over time as a result of climate change.
> Given how climate change could impact the food and agriculture industry and its VC and the consequences for nutritional value, food security, and human health for vulnerable populations, there is an urgent need to assess, measure and characterize how the geospatial configuration of the food systems and human health could evolve over time as a consequence of the impacts of adverse climate change in the years to come. The long-term goal of this project is to expand knowledge about the impacts that adverse climate change could have, in the short- and long-run on the configuration of the VC in the food systems, and the consequences of such impacts to food security and human health outcomes. In the absence of the knowledge that this project aims to provide, it will be likely difficult to evaluate, define and suggest optimal and effective mitigation and adaptation policies to counteract the effects of climate change on human health that result from food insecurity, and eradicate existing food-insecure households in the US.
> This project will measure by how much farmers (i.e., primary producers) sell disproportionately to final consumers (i.e., farmers are downstream in the VC), or sell little to final consumers (i.e., farmers are upstream in the VC). The overall objective is to identify which levels, structures and functions of the VC in the food system will be most affected by climate change, in order to quantify the degree by which such impacts on the different VC levels are accountable for households’ health conditions, especially for those that are vulnerable and living in states of the US experiencing food security and adverse climate change. The central hypothesis is that more upstream farmers (primary producers) are in the VC (there is long distance separating the primary production and consumption, organizational and/or geographical), will have two consequences: 1) weaker linkage between i) the primary producer’s goals and households’ nutrition needs and socioeconomic characteristics, and ii) the crop type production and households’ good health goals; and 2)  households would become more vulnerable to food security and health risks if many production sectors along the VC are susceptible to climate change.
> To attain the overall objective, this project will pursue to address the following specific objectives:
> a)	To predict and obtain statistical estimates of the effects of climate change on the production sectors along the VC of the food systems by staple product and state, using geospatial data, and determine whether the effects will be different across states. The working hypothesis is that the climate change will have negative effects on the productivity of the production sectors in the VC, and that the differences across states will be due to i) culture, social, and economic conditions; ii) structure and organization of the VC of the food systems; iii) existing governance arrangements of the authority and power relationships that regulate, coordinate, and monitor all levels of the VC; and iv) institutions that shape the rules, norms, and standards in which a VC is embedded. 
> b)	To measure how climate change can impact the role that each of the production sectors in the VC, in municipalities and states, plays in determining the spatial organization of their agricultural economic activities, and in explaining the existing wide variation in food security among states in the US. The working hypothesis is that the more upstream the primary producers operate, the greater food insecurity, because it creates a weaker linkage between the primary producer’s goals and households’ nutrition needs and socioeconomic characteristics than otherwise, and climate change makes that link feebler.
> c)	To present a geospatial and quantitative analysis of the effects that climate change has had and can be expected to have in the future on the relationship between these VCs and human health, when the latter is associated to food security. The working hypothesis is that the more upstream the primary producers operate, the greater because the linkage between the agriculture production type and households’ good health goals is weaker than otherwise, and more so if the other production sectors along the VC are sufficiently enough susceptible to climate change.
> d)	To generate a geographic understanding of VCs and the implications of that spatial structure for potential future changes for producers and consumers of food. The working hypothesis is that VCs are fundamental geospatial, and that their geospatial relationships shape how they provide value to agents along them and how these agents are locked-into existing outcomes.
> The rationale underlying the proposed research project is that, by identifying, assessing and making predictions about the most important impacts of the VC of the food systems to climate change and extremes, and the consequential impacts on food security and health of households, policymakers can design better-targeted mitigation and adaptation policies and reduce at a minimum such risks.
> This original proposed scientific approach will develop and motivate interdisciplinary work by expanding and coupling the geospatial sciences, environment, human geography, social sciences, and quantitative methods in order to contribute to the understanding of the interlinkages between human health, the food systems and climate. Regarding expected outcomes are determine the magnitude of the effects of climate change on the VC of food systems and the consequences to human health, as well as highlighting the direct and indirect pathways in which the physical impacts of climate change may work through the food systems to impact food security and, subsequently, human health. The positive impact of these outcomes is to protect the most vulnerable population from food shortages and scarcities, and the producers’ productivity, large and small producers, and other participants of the VC with warnings on undesirable climate change and extreme weather events. 
> The team is well prepared to undertake this project because of its expertise, previous research and scientific publications on environment and natural resources, human geography, economics, multiple quantitative methods. We have an extensive experience in the interdisciplinary research on the environmental risk in the food systems that is needed for this project. The team will count with exceptional facilities at the University of Delaware, such as the Delaware Advanced Research Workforce and Innovation Network (DARWIN) which could support the team with diverse software and hardware needs including large datasets; in addition to the Artificial Intelligence Laboratories which are dedicated, among other things, to develop algorithms and machine learning modelling applied to interdisciplinary research.
