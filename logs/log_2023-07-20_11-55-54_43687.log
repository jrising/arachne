> Dear Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki,
> 
> I'm delighted to hear of your interest in the Ph.D. Program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. From the details in your email, you seem well-qualified to do research in this field, especially given your focus on climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, sustainable development, and economic growth.
> 
> Our program is a good choice for non-traditional students or those coming from a less-quantitative background. However, funding is invariably a constraint in our ability to accept students into our Ph.D. programs. We do have limited funding available, but I would advise you to apply by the end of the calendar year so that you can be considered for any available funds.
> 
> Please be aware that the Masters in Marine Policy has now transitioned to the thrilling new Environmental Science & Management program, which includes a Marine track. For this new ESM program, limited funding is available, and it is self-funded for most students. 
> 
> As your research aligns well with interdisciplinary quantitative modeling related to climate change risks, you might also make a strong candidate for our Masters in Environmental Economics program. Note that this is a self-funded program.
> 
> If you're considering one of the natural science programs offered by the School of Marine Science & Policy, I would recommend contacting Xinfeng Liang at <xfliang@udel.edu>.
> 
> In summary, considering your background and interests, I warmly encourage you to apply. Your research areas are compelling and we look forward to having your application reviewed.
