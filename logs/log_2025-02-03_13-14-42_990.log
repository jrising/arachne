> how can the natianl housing trust support the work of the venfor mathmaking tool devloped by the building inoation hub? " One of the barriers to opportunity within Black and Brown communities is adequate access to the internet and technology. NHT is working to bridge that gap. With support from funders, we installed free, high-speed internet in 193 households at our properties. The Truist Foundation also awarded funds to implement a Device Loan Program, which provides residents access to short-term laptop loans from NHT's lending library. The Device Loan Program is absolutely free and residents can volunteer in community programs to earn laptop ownership. With unlimited access to these devices, residents can expand their knowledge through online digital literacy training and participate more fully in the digital world.

> Equity in the Workplace
> NHT has made a commitment to integrating a racial equity focus and strategy into our organizational structure and long-term strategic plan. We want to establish NHT as a pioneer in racial equity and antiracism among those who work in the housing industry, including advocates, developers, and policy experts. We also want to proactively make connections between systemic racism, access to affordable housing, and workplace issues. The racial, cultural, and life experiences of the communities we serve will be better represented by the NHT Staff and Board. NHT will actively seek out and keep employees of color and those who share our commitment to racial fairness. The distribution of resources, including funding, human capital, and programming, will demonstrate a dedication to racial equity.
