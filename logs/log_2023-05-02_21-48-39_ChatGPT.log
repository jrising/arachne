**assistant**:
> As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I cannot provide information on models released after that date. However, I can recommend a similar machine within the Dell OptiPlex line that was available as of September 2021. You might want to consider the Dell OptiPlex 7090 Tower or the Dell OptiPlex 7090 Ultra.
