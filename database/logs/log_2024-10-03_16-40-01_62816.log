In a conversation about best practices for throwing user-facing errors in Julia, James inquired about the appropriate methods. I advised using standard error types like `ArgumentError`, creating custom exceptions if necessary, and crafting descriptive messages that convey the issue clearly. I emphasized the importance of simplicity in the error-throwing code and suggested using `@error` logging for non-critical issues. Additionally, I recommended localizing errors near their source for easier resolution. To illustrate, I provided an example function that throws an `ArgumentError` when an invalid `user_id` is passed, demonstrating an effective way to communicate issues to users.
