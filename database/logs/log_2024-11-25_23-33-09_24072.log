In this conversation, James Rising requested assistance in crafting a response to an inquiry from Urmila Selvakumar about potential postgraduate opportunities related to fisheries and climate change. I highlighted the need to direct her towards various programs, including the transition from the Masters in Marine Policy to the Environmental Science & Management program with a marine track. I noted her qualifications indicate suitability for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics and emphasized limited funding availability, particularly for traditional Ph.D. tracks. The response included a suggestion to complete a form for program selection guidance and encouraged her to mention their shared research interests in her application.
