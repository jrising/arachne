Jacqueline A. Dowling's research explores the role of long-duration energy storage in meeting short-term storage needs by efficiently providing electricity during gaps in solar and wind resources. The study investigates how regional variations in wind and solar energy resources influence the value of utilizing single or multiple storage technologies to reduce the overbuilding of solar and wind generation capacity for meeting electricity demand reliably.
