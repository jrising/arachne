In the conversation, James provided a list of references from Google Scholar focusing on the economic impacts of climate change, including various studies that analyze temperature deviations and their effects on productivity and growth. Key papers discussed include Kahn et al. (2021) examining long-term macroeconomic effects across countries, Bilal & KÃ¤nzig (2024) estimating larger-than-expected macroeconomic damages, and Kotz et al. (2021) on daily temperature variability's impact on economic growth. I synthesized the references into a structured table detailing authors, publication years, and journals for easy reference, highlighting foundational studies in the field of climate economics.
