This conversation revolves around providing a response comment from a progressive welfare economics perspective to the draft update of Circular A-4, which guides regulatory analysis in the US. The response comment emphasizes several key points. First, it highlights the need to consider distributional effects and the impact of regulations on different income groups, marginalized communities, and future generations. Second, it calls for a broader definition of well-being that includes non-monetary factors and alternative metrics. Third, it emphasizes the importance of considering the environment and sustainability in regulatory analysis, particularly in addressing externalities like climate change. Fourth, it advocates for a global perspective in analyzing regulations. The conversation also covers the appropriate use of revealed preference methods, distributional effects analysis, utilization of distributional weights, accounting for diminishing marginal utility, and quantitative analysis of uncertainty. The synthesis concludes with an official comment acknowledging the importance of the updates and identifying areas for further improvement, with a focus on ethical considerations, modern welfare economics, and climate change cost-benefit analysis. The additional bullet point added to the letter highlights the incorporation of distributional effects in cost-benefit analysis as a crucial step towards aligning US policy with contemporary welfare economics.
