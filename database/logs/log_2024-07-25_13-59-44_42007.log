The supplementary information details a method for inferring missing data in ecological studies by leveraging taxonomically related species. It outlines the principles behind the method, data preprocessing steps using larval dynamics, taxonomy data, and home range information, construction of an integrated taxonomy, and a hierarchical inference process. The method involves species-specific lookup, genus-level aggregation, and a hierarchical taxonomic search to impute missing values effectively. This structured approach enhances the reliability and comprehensiveness of ecological analyses, contributing to more accurate and sustainable environmental models.
