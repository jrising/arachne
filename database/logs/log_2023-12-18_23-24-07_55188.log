The earliest carbon emissions trading system implemented in the US was the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), established in 2009. RGGI is a cooperative effort among ten states in the northeastern region to cap and reduce CO2 emissions from the power sector. It was the first mandatory market-based program in the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. RGGI operates as a cap-and-trade system, setting an overall limit on emissions from power plants and allowing trading of allowances to find the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions.
