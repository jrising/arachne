James inquired about an issue with additional "Unnamed" columns being added when combining data into a CSV file using Python's pandas library. I explained that this often occurs due to improperly saved index columns or inconsistencies between DataFrames. I recommended ensuring the CSV is saved without the index by using `index=False`, checking the DataFrames for alignment during concatenation, and verifying the reading process. Additionally, I suggested a method to programmatically drop unwanted "Unnamed" columns if they still appear after taking preventive measures. Following these suggestions should help James resolve the issue effectively.
