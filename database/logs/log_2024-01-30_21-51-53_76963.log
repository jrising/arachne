Drawing from the insights outlined in Dewberry Engineers (2018), the Delaware ocean and bay spatial planning process must acknowledge critical aspects where data may be lacking. Key issues include maintaining the safety of shipping channels, managing conflicting uses between recreational and commercial vessels, and ensuring proposed projects do not impact shipping channels. Data requirements identified in the report include vessel monitoring systems (VMS) for commercial fishing activity, automatic identification systems (AIS) for tracking vessel traffic, synthesized oceanographic parameters, and human and cultural use areas. Other crucial datasets with possible gaps are bathymetry, recent aerial imagery, and the locations of on- and off-shore facilities. These data gaps must be addressed to facilitate the unimpeded growth of global ocean trade, maintenance of port facilities, and the safety of various vessels operating in the Delaware ocean and bay areas.
