The data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process, as identified in reports by Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021), highlight the need for improved abundance and distribution data of marine species. These gaps encompass marine mammals, birds, fish, and deep sea corals, and are often addressed through at-sea transect surveys, trawl data, and aerial/shipboard surveys. Data improvements would support offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience, climate adaptation, offshore renewable energy siting, and oil/gas exploration. Additionally, more data is needed for areas beyond the Atlantic, focusing on invasive species and trend analysis. The availability and accessibility of both observation and modeled data is crucial, utilizing GIS-ready formats to promote effective decision-making. Proper funding, regular updates, and documentation of data processes are required to maintain and refresh models. The findings emphasize the importance of obtaining timely, species-specific data to inform Delaware's marine spatial planning efforts.
