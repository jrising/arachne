James sought assistance on adding "www." as an option to his domain "openmodeling.org" registered with Google Domains. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions on adding a CNAME record in the DNS management of Google Domains. The CNAME record would redirect any DNS queries for "www.openmodeling.org" to "openmodeling.org". Arachne also mentioned that DNS changes might take some time to propagate, and advised that after the propagation period, James should be able to access his site using "www.openmodeling.org". She also mentioned that the site might need time to update its SSL certificate to include the www version of the domain. James was satisfied with the instructions and didn't require any further assistance.
