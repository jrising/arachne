James inquired about organizing a list of functional groups of fish categorized by size and type. I recommended structuring the data into three main categories: Large (>=90 cm), Medium (30 - 89 cm), and Small (<30 cm), along with a category for Small to Medium (<90 cm) species. Each size category was then organized into specific functional types (e.g., bathydemersals, pelagics, rays, etc.). This classification aimed to enhance clarity and usability, suggesting the potential for nested data structures like dictionaries or DataFrames for further processing or documentation purposes.
