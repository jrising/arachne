The conversation revolved around drafting a professional email response for Bornali Mondal, who expressed interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. Bornali reached out to James Rising for feedback on her research paper about the Environmental Kuznets Curve and mentioned her application for fall 2025. In response, I provided a concise draft for James to acknowledge her follow-up, encourage her research pursuits, and suggest scheduling a Zoom chat for further discussion. The email maintained a professional tone, addressed her inquiry, and invited further communication through a provided link.
