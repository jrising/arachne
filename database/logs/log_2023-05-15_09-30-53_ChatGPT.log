James requested a blessing that combines elements of his family's Lutheran and Jewish roots, a secular blessing, and the Native American Thanksgiving Address. The initial options provided by the AI were considered too corny, so James asked for alternatives with four lines. He also wanted to remove explicit references to multilingualism. The AI provided simplified versions, and James selected one with four lines. However, he requested variations to change the phrase "hands unseen" to explicitly mention the people involved. James also asked for powerful sayings or blessings that could be incorporated, and the AI suggested a few options from different traditions. James then modified the selected blessing to achieve a consistent syllable count in each line. The AI offered several variations to meet James' request. James was satisfied with one version and asked for slight modifications to adjust the syllable count. The AI provided alternative options, and James selected a final version that met his requirements.
