James inquired about the closed-form solution for the matrix inversion of `(k - I_N)`, where `k` is a scalar and `I_N` is the identity matrix of size `N x N`. I confirmed that the inverse exists as long as `k â‰  1`. The inversion can be expressed as `A^-1 = 1/(k - 1) * I_N`, where `A = (k - I_N)`. I explained that the diagonal elements of `(k - I_N)` are `(k - 1)`, making the matrix invertible, while highlighting the importance of avoiding division by zero when `k = 1`.
