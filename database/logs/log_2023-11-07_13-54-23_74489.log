The methodology section for the report on estimating current climate losses is presented in LaTeX format. The Projections subsection outlines the steps involved in the analysis. It begins with the utilization of ERA5 reanalysis weather data from 1940 to 2022 and the incorporation of Monte Carlo simulations to account for parameter uncertainty. The immediate impact of climate change on GDP is calculated by simulating models under actual weather conditions and a hypothetical scenario with no climate change. The impacts are then aggregated over time using a formula that considers the persistence of climate shocks. The global projections are derived by combining country-specific results. The methodology provides a robust and comprehensive approach to estimating current climate losses and will support discussions and policy decisions.
