In the previous conversation, James asked about the number of grants Lenfest gives annually, to which I provided an explanation that I don't have specific information on that. James then inquired about creating and raising user-defined exceptions in Python, and I provided an example illustrating how to define and raise custom exceptions. Subsequently, James asked about defining class-level methods in Python, and I explained how to do so and provided an example. He then asked if it is possible to define a static method that can be overridden by subclasses, and I confirmed that it is indeed possible and explained how to do it. James also asked how to call an overloaded static method using an instance, and I clarified that it is not possible since static methods are not bound to instances. Finally, James asked for the standard practice for creating a Zoom invite title for an interview, and I gave several guidelines to consider.
