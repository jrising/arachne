James inquired about budgeting for full-time childcare in London for his 3-year-old and 5-year-old. I explained that childcare costs can vary significantly based on care type and location. I provided estimates: nursery care for a 3-year-old ranges from £1,200 to £1,800 per month; after-school clubs for a 5-year-old typically cost £100 to £200 per week; childminders generally charge £7 to £10 per hour; and nanny shares usually range from £11 to £15 per hour. I also highlighted potential cost offsets through government free childcare schemes for eligible families and the availability of employer benefits like childcare vouchers. Additionally, I advised considering extra costs for registration, meals, and activities.
