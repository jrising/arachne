James inquired about a short way to refer to a liberal arts college, to which I responded with the acronym LAC. He then mentioned several colleges he thought were in the Delaware area, seeking clarification on their names. I noted that the colleges listed were actually in Pennsylvania and provided the corrected list: Haverford College, Bryn Mawr College, Swarthmore College, and Gettysburg College. This discussion focused on accurately identifying and naming liberal arts colleges in nearby states rather than Delaware.
