James asked how to use the `listings` package in LaTeX to format R code, specifically concerning `\lstinline{rbar <- 200:900}`, noting issues with symbol sizes and spacing. I recommended including the `listings` package in the preamble and defining a custom R language setup using `\lstdefinelanguage`. I provided code snippets to handle symbols and spacing correctly and suggested using `\texttt{}` for short inline code. For longer code, I advised using the `lstlisting` environment to encapsulate multiple lines. This setup should suffice for proper formatting in LaTeX documents.
