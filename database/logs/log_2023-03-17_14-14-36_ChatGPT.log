James asked when COVID started and I provided a concise summary. I explained that the COVID-19 pandemic originated in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the first cases were reported in December of that year. I also mentioned that the outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020.
