The discussion revolved around the reading assignment of a research paper on cod fishing history by Rosenberg et al., which estimates cod biomass on the Scotian Shelf using historical fishing logs from the 19th century. The study highlights the drastic decline in cod populations, estimating a biomass of 1.26 million metric tons in 1852 compared to less than 50,000 metric tons today. Key concepts such as "shifting baselines syndrome" were introduced, emphasizing the risks of underestimating historical fish stocks when setting management goals. To assess students’ understanding, multiple-choice questions were crafted, covering details like the primary sources used in the study, fishing techniques, and the implications of the historical perspective on modern fishery policies. The questions aimed at testing the students’ comprehension of the paper’s main points and broader ecological implications.
