In a discussion on collaboration between the National Housing Trust (NHT) and the Building Innovation Hub in Washington, DC, James inquired about how they could support each other's efforts. I outlined several key strategies, including knowledge sharing and expertise, collaborative projects focusing on sustainable housing, joint advocacy for policies promoting equity and sustainability, training and capacity building initiatives, networking opportunities with local stakeholders, and the development of pilot projects to demonstrate innovative and affordable housing solutions. The overall aim is to create a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable housing ecosystem in DC, leveraging the strengths of both organizations.
