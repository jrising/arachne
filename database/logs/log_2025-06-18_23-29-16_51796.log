James inquired about the value of the infinite sum \( A d^n \) for \( d < 1 \). I explained that this corresponds to an infinite geometric series, given by \( S = A + Ad + Ad^2 + Ad^3 + \ldots \), which converges when the common ratio \( d \) is less than 1. The formula for the sum of such a series is \( S = \frac{A}{1 - d} \). Thus, the value of the sum is \( \frac{A}{1 - d} \), applicable as long as \( d \) remains within the range of -1 and 1.
