In a discussion between James and the assistant, James sought guidance on combining two plots side-by-side in `ggplot2`, indicating that one plot was using `facet_wrap` and wanted the left plot to take up half the space. The assistant suggested using the `patchwork` package for layout flexibility but encountered an error regarding mismatched data frame sizes. Following James's clarification that the plots had different data structures but shared x-variable groups, the assistant emphasized that `patchwork` allows independent plots. After further discussion, James opted for the `cowplot` solution and requested assistance to remove y-axis labels from the right plot for a seamless appearance. The assistant provided the necessary code to achieve this, ensuring a cohesive visual presentation.
