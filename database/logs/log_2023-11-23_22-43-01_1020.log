James sought assistance on creating a series of related plots in ggplot2 that would line up exactly on consecutive slides. He wanted to show only specific lines and exclude them from both the graph and legend. Arachne suggested manipulating the 'alpha' aesthetic in ggplot2, using a function that rendered certain lines invisible by setting their alpha value to 0. Additionally, Arachne provided an alternative approach to remove the non-visible groups entirely from the plot and legend. James was encouraged to let Arachne know if further assistance was required.
