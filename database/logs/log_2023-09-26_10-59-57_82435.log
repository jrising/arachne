Soil fertility in Africa has been lost due to nutrient mining, inadequate use of fertilizers, deforestation, erosion, climate change, and poor land management practices. Farmers often extract more nutrients from the soil than they return to it, leading to nutrient depletion. Many use organic fertilizers, but they are insufficient, and inorganic fertilizers are either unaffordable or inaccessible. Deforestation for agricultural land and firewood negatively impacts soil structure and organic matter. Unsustainable farming practices accelerate soil erosion, stripping away fertile topsoil. Climate change, with changing rainfall patterns and increased temperatures, further impacts soil fertility. Poor land management practices like monocropping and overgrazing also contribute to declining soil fertility. Comprehensive solutions are needed to improve farmers' access to environmentally sound fertilizers and promote sustainable land management practices.
