The discussion was about the stylized picture of concentric commercial, industrial, and residential regions in theoretical studies of urban geography. The Concentric Zone Model, also known as the Burgess Model, was described as a representation of a city with a central business district, zone of transition, zone of independent worker's homes, zone of better residences, and a commuter's zone. It was noted that this model simplifies the complexity and diversity of actual cities.
