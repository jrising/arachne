In a previous conversation, James asked about the stylized picture of concentric commercial, industrial, and residential regions described in theoretical studies of urban geography. I explained that this picture is referred to as the "Concentric Zone Model" or "Burgess Model." I described the model, which was created by sociologist Ernest Burgess in the 1920s, and outlined its five zones: the Central Business District, Zone of Transition, Zone of Independent Worker's Homes, Zone of Better Residences, and Commuter's Zone. I also noted that while the model provides a basic structure for urban development, it oversimplifies the complexity and diversity of real cities.
