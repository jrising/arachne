James is attempting to run an old TurboGears site using MongoDB but encounters errors related to Ming and PyMongo compatibility. The errors include a TypeError indicating a deprecated method, and an OperationFailure stating that a command is unsupported due to version discrepancies. I confirmed that these issues result from using incompatible versions of MongoDB, Ming, and PyMongo. I suggested downgrading MongoDB, recommending a version like 2.6.x as a starting point while cautioning about the risks of downgrading, including potential data loss. I emphasized the need for data backup and advised considering future upgrades to ensure compatibility with newer technologies for better performance and security.
