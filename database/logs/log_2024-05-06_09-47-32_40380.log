James inquired about coffee prices denoted as "USX" on Yahoo Finance, wondering if they were inflation-adjusted. I clarified that "USX" refers to US dollars without inflation adjustment. Commodity prices on Yahoo Finance are reported in nominal terms, reflecting market prices at the time without considering inflation. To compare real value over time, manual adjustment for inflation using an index like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) would be necessary.
