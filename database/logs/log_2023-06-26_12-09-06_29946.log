The user asked about handling the potential reduction in interpretability when using LASSO regression. The assistant suggested using group LASSO, a variant of LASSO that enforces grouped selection of variables, allowing for better interpretation. The assistant provided a basic example of how to perform group LASSO using the "grpreg" package in R.
