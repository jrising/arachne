In a previous conversation, James asked about handling the potential reduction in interpretability of LASSO results when core variables are dropped but their interactions are retained. The assistant suggested using group LASSO, which enforces grouped selection of variables. The assistant provided an example using the `grpreg` package in R and advised James to define groups that include main effects and their corresponding interactions. By applying group LASSO, variables will be included or excluded in groups, preserving the interpretability of the results.
