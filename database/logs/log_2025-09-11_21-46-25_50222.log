Bornali Mondal expressed her interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics under James Rising, sharing her research on the Environmental Kuznets Curve. After initial correspondence where James acknowledged her application and enthusiasm, he informed her of the lack of funding for new students in 2025. Despite Bornali's repeated requests for guidance and potential funding options, James reiterated that financial constraints prevented him from accepting new students and suggested she seek external scholarships. He provided resources like the Commonwealth Scholarship and Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation Scholarships to assist her search. Bornali inquired about future funding opportunities, and James indicated that he would notify her if circumstances changed.
