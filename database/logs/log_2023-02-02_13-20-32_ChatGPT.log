When computing Conley standard errors for a time series model, it is important to choose appropriate spatial and temporal cut-offs. Best practices include using a Moran's I test for spatial cut-offs and an autocorrelation function (ACF) plot for temporal cut-offs. Balancing spatial and temporal cut-offs is crucial to strike a balance between model complexity and interpretability. The specific context and goals of the analysis should be considered when selecting cut-off values. The optimal cut-offs may vary between studies and datasets. These guidelines ensure the accuracy and validity of the results.
