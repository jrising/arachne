In the previous discussion, James wanted to estimate a regression tree with only 9 observations but was only getting a root node using the rpart function in R. The assistant suggested several things to try, including adjusting the complexity parameter (cp), minimum number of observations required to split a node (minsplit), and minimum number of observations required in a terminal node (minbucket). The assistant also recommended trying different algorithms like ctree or rpart.plot, and considering alternative modeling approaches for small sample sizes. In a subsequent query, James asked how to extract split values and leafs from an rpart object. The assistant provided an example using the summary() function to extract split values (`tree$split$breaks`) and leaf values (`tree$frame$yval`) from the rpart object.
