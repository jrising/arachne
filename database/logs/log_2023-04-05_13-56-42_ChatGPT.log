James wants to estimate a regression tree but is getting only a root node with the rpart function in R due to the small sample size of 9 observations. The assistant recommends adjusting the complexity parameter, minimum number of observations, or trying a different tree-building algorithm. The assistant also suggests considering alternative modeling approaches suited for small sample sizes. James then asks how to extract split values and leafs from an rpart object. The assistant provides an example using the `summary()` function and explains how to extract the split values and leaf values.
