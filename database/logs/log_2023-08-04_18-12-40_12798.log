James was looking for a way to include non-parenthetical citations using the Zotero plugin in Google Docs. I informed him that the Zotero Google Docs integration does not support non-parenthetical citations natively but provided two possible workarounds: customizing the citation format after inserting it or using a different citation manager that supports non-parenthetical citations. James then asked if he could create a "hidden" citation that would appear in the bibliography without being visible in the main text. I explained that he can create a hidden citation by inserting a citation placeholder, modifying its formatting to make it inconspicuous, and refreshing the bibliography. However, I cautioned him that if he refreshes the citation, any formatting changes may be overridden and would need to be reapplied.
