In the previous conversation, James asked about creating non-parenthetical citations using the Zotero plugin in Google Docs. The assistant explained that the current Zotero plugin does not support non-parenthetical citations natively, but provided two workarounds: manually customizing the citation format after inserting it or using a different citation manager that supports non-parenthetical citations. The assistant also suggested requesting this feature in Zotero's roadmap. James then asked if he could create a "hidden" citation to ensure its inclusion in the bibliography without it being visible in the main text. The assistant confirmed that this is possible and provided steps for creating a hidden citation in Zotero. The steps included inserting a visible citation placeholder, modifying its formatting to make it inconspicuous, and refreshing the bibliography to include the hidden citation. The assistant advised reviewing the final document to ensure the hidden citation functions as intended.
