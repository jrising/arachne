James sought a textbook recommendation for advancing his input-output modeling skills with a focus on linear algebra. The suggested books were "Input-Output Analysis: Foundations and Extensions" by Ronald E. Miller and Peter D. Blair, "Input-Output Economics" by Wassily Leontief, and "Matrix Methods in Economics" by Ichiro Takayama for matrix operations and theorem proofs. Emphasizing the importance of balancing linear algebra with economic intuition, the conversation aimed to steer James towards a deeper understanding of input-output modeling principles.
