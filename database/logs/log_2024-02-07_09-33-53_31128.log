James asked about the number of allowances his wife should put on her W-4 form since he has already claimed the children as dependents on his taxes. Arachne explained that since they are filing taxes jointly, the number of allowances on the W-4 form should be determined together and based on their total allowances and deductions. However, if they are adjusting their W-4 forms for withholding purposes, a larger number of allowances means less tax will be withheld. Arachne suggested that for a family of four, it is common to put 3-4 allowances, considering the standard deduction for a married couple and credits for two dependents. She recommended claiming 2 allowances for themselves and 1 for each dependent, totaling 4 allowances, as a general guide. However, the actual number can vary based on individual financial situations, and consulting a tax adviser is advised. James then asked if his wife should claim 0 allowances since he has already claimed them. Arachne explained that it is common to claim 0 allowances when starting a new job to maximize tax withholding and avoid unexpected tax bills. However, claiming 0 allowances may result in higher taxes being withheld than necessary, leading to a larger tax refund. She suggested considering claiming 1 or 2 allowances if they prefer to have more money in their paychecks throughout the year. The decision should be based on their specific tax situation and preferences, and it is recommended to consult a tax professional or use online tax calculators.
