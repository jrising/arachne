The discussion focused on refining and adjusting the objectives for Objective 3 and Objective 6 of the "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)" project's Statement of Project Objectives. The main aim was to develop a comprehensive and strategic Community Benefits Plan (CBP) that promotes equity, diversity, inclusion, and environmental justice within the offshore wind industry. The adjusted objectives emphasized the importance of designing a robust implementation strategy for the CBP and continuously improving and enhancing the CBP's impact. The objectives were modified to ensure concrete and tangible outcomes, including active support for vulnerable communities and the creation of economic opportunities in the renewable economy.
