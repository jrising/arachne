James asked how to delete a list of items from a SQLite database in SQLAlchemy when he had the full objects from a select call. The assistant provided guidance on two methods: individually deleting each object using a loop and batch deleting using IDs extracted from the objects. Examples of both methods were given with cautionary notes on bulk operations and session management. James was advised to choose the method that best suited his use case.
