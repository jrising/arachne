The user wanted to know how to remove the rounded rectangle surrounding the `geom_labels` in ggplot. The assistant provided a code snippet that includes setting the `label.padding` and `label.r` to `unit(0, "lines")` within the `theme` function. The user mentioned that they still got a square box around each label and wanted to make it transparent. The assistant then provided an updated code snippet that includes setting the `label.background` to `element_rect(fill = NA)` within the `geom_label` function. This sets the background of the labels to transparent. The user thanked the assistant and the issue was resolved.
