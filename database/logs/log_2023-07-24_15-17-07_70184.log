The user asks how to remove the rounded rectangle around `geom_labels` in ggplot. The assistant provides code examples using the `theme` function to remove the background from various elements and adjust padding, but the user still sees a square box around each label. The assistant then provides a revised code example using `label.background = element_rect(fill = NA)` within `geom_label` to make the square box transparent.
