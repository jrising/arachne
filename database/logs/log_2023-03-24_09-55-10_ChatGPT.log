In the discussion, James asked for a word that sounds like "commerce" but refers to storage or space. The word "commissary" was provided, defined as a store or storage space. James then requested other words derived from the same root as "commissary" related to its definition. The response provided six additional words derived from the Latin root "commissarius," including commission, commissariat, commissaryship, commissure, committee, and commodious. These words have various meanings related to storage, supply, or delegation of duties.
