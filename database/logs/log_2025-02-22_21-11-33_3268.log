James sought a beginner-friendly piano book featuring folk music for family sing-alongs, having prior experience with multiple instruments. I recommended "The Simple Collection for Piano," which I later clarified was not a specific title. Instead, I provided suggestions like "Easy Piano Folk Songs" by David Carr Glover, "First Book of Jazz Songs for Piano" by David Dutkanicz, "The Leisurely Pianist: Folk Songs" by Helen S. Barlow, and "The Kingâ€™s Singers: Folksongs." Each recommendation aimed at playing accessible music that would engage him and his family in singing together. I offered continued support if he needed help finding these books.
