James approached Arachne for suggestions on how to run a LASSO on a large dataset with a high number of predictors. Arachne provided several strategies to tackle the memory issue, including sampling a smaller subset of the data, distributing the computation across subsets of predictors, and using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. Arachne also suggested increasing available memory or trying alternative regularization algorithms or machine learning tools. These strategies would help James address the memory constraints and still obtain accurate and useful feature importance information.
