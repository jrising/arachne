Both the I-20 and DS-2019 forms are official U.S. government documents that certify eligibility for F (academic) or J (exchange) visa statuses. The I-20 is used to apply for an F-1 student visa and indicates admission to a full-time study program or a language-training program at an accredited educational institution. On the other hand, the DS-2019 is required for a J-1 exchange visitor visa and is issued by program sponsors for participation in exchange programs, such as studying, teaching, conducting research, or receiving training. In summary, the forms have similar functions but are used for different types of visas and are issued by different institutions or sponsors.
