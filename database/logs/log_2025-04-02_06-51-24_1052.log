The conversation focused on the degradation of the Amazon rainforest and its economic risks, highlighting that substitution possibilities for dependent sectors diminish as climate shocks increase. Studies indicate that compounded climatological effects are reducing forest resilience, affecting agricultural outputs and leading to significant agribusiness lossesâ€”like a 5.5% decline in Brazil's earnings during a drought. Furthermore, operations downstream may be restricted due to global forest degradation, with Southeast Asia and Africa also facing significant losses in forest cover. The discussion outlined Phase 3, assessing risks to and within the financial system, showing how economic risks from the Amazon's degradation can transmit via traditional categories, particularly impacting banks linked to ecosystem services. Research revealed that 46% of Brazilian banks' loans are tied to these sectors, with potential for a notable rise in non-performing loans as ecosystem services collapse.
