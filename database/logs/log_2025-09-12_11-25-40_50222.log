James inquired about good PhD programs in environmental economics. I shared a list of notable programs across various regions: in the United States, institutions like Harvard University, UC Berkeley, Yale University, and Stanford University were highlighted for their strong focus on environmental and resource economics. In the UK, I mentioned the London School of Economics and Political Science and the University of Cambridge for their interdisciplinary approaches. In Europe, ETH Zurich and Tilburg University were noted for their emphasis on sustainability and economic policy. Lastly, the Australian National University was recognized for its work on sustainability and climate policy. I emphasized the importance of considering faculty and research centers alongside the institution's reputation when selecting a program.
