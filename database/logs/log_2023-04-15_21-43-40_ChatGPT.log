James sought assistance in evaluating statements of purpose from multiple candidates applying for a research assistant position in updating the PAGE integrated assessment model. Arachne provided rankings for each group of candidates based on their skills, interests, and alignment with the project description. James then requested updates to the rankings based on additional preferences, including motivation for working in climate policy, the ability to learn the Julia programming language, clear communication, and aptitude for environmental economics. Arachne revised the rankings accordingly. Later, James expressed concerns about the top candidate's focus on data science, leading Arachne to reassess the rankings once more.
