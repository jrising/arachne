In a previous conversation, James asked for an appropriate representation of absolute time that is not dependent on timezone and can be saved in a YAML file in Python. Arachne suggested using Unix/Epoch time, which is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 1 January 1970 in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Arachne provided Python code to obtain the Unix timestamp using the `time` package. The timestamp can then be saved in the YAML file. It was also noted that when reading the timestamps, conversion back to the appropriate timezone may be necessary.
