James seeks assistance in creating a "random encounter" table for a Moby Dick-based game. Arachne provides a preliminary list of events, including sighting different types of whales, encountering other ships, and experiencing various situations. James asks about the probabilities of these events occurring. Arachne suggests rough probabilities based on the frequency of incidents in Moby Dick and historical context, and provides a Python list of events and probabilities. James requests probabilities for nothing happening based on the boat's location. Arachne suggests probabilities ranging from 60-70% near-shore, 50-60% en route, and 30-40% on a whaling ground. Arachne recommends experimenting with different values to balance excitement and downtime in the game.
