James sought advice on helping his 5-year-old son transition to sleeping in underwear while managing bedwetting. I suggested several strategies, including limiting liquids before bedtime, establishing a consistent bedtime routine with bathroom use, and incentivizing dry nights through a reward system like stickers. Additionally, I recommended using a waterproof mattress protector to alleviate stress about accidents. For persistent issues, bedwetting alarms were mentioned as a potential solution. I encouraged open discussions to normalize the situation and emphasized patience, noting that each child develops at their own pace.
