James was searching for a song from the 2000s, mentioning the artist Monte in connection to a line "what do we know, we're only 17". Initially misremembered as Mondo Rock, the correct song was "The Bad Touch" by The Bloodhound Gang, known for their comedic style. When James inquired about bands with "Monte" in their name from the 90s-00s, options like Monte Pittman, Mondo Cane, and The Monte Carlos were suggested, none perfectly fitting the comedy group description he mentioned.
