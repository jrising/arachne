The original proposal by James Rising aims to estimate the current macroeconomic losses from climate change for each country. The project will develop best-estimates of the percent reductions in GDP per capita and capital wealth in 2023 compared to a world without climate change since 1950. The methodology involves combining existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate and using a machine learning model to produce estimates that reflect the most advanced features of multiple papers. The proposed methodology for the "Capital Accumulation" section is also provided, which involves a conceptualized model of capital dynamics influenced by climate change effects. Various equations and data sources are used to simulate the impacts of climate change on renewable capital, produced capital, and human capital. The model fitting employs the MCMC computational Bayes method with Stan.
