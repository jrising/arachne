James sought to add tooltips to individual options within a group of checkboxes in his Shiny app. The initial solution using `{shinyBS}` provided tooltips for the entire group, not individual options. I recommended customizing HTML elements with JavaScript to add tooltips to each checkbox option individually. By assigning unique identifiers and utilizing jQuery to set tooltips based on option text, James could enhance user experience and clarity in selecting options within the app.
