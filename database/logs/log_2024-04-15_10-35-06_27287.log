James requested assistance in creating a global map in R showing curved lines between start and end points. Arachne provided a detailed solution using `ggplot2`, `sf`, and `geosphere` packages, including a custom function `add_gc_interpolate` to generate interpolated points along the great circle routes. The plot showcased the curvature of the paths, with the `gcIntermediate` function calculating the routes. Arachne emphasized adjusting the granularity (`n` parameter) for smoother lines and highlighted the use of `coord_map()` for accurate map scaling. The solution offered a visually appealing representation of global connections based on latitude and longitude data.
