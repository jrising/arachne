The conversation focused on developing a consensus list regarding adaptation investment points. James sought to refine previous points, especially around the positive yet realistic framing of adaptation investments and their alignment with private sector opportunities. A revised list was proposed, incorporating Paul's insights on private sector financing. The six proposed points emphasized government support, context-specific benefits, international funding opportunities, resilience investments, and challenges in integrating adaptation with decarbonization and development efforts. James invited further discussion or a Zoom meeting to solidify the case studies and their connections to the consensus points.
