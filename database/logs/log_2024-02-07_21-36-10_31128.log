In this conversation, James asks for guidance on how to use the different glue containers that came with his model boat kit, given that the instructions mention "white (or carpenter's) glue" and "contact (or cobbler's) glue". The assistant provides a detailed explanation, associating the glues in the kit with the ones mentioned in the instructions. The D3 PVA Fast Setting glue is identified as the white (or carpenter's) glue, suitable for quick bonding of larger pieces. The High, Medium, and Thin viscosity adhesives are linked to the contact (or cobbler's) glue, with different viscosities serving different purposes, such as gap-filling or precise applications. The assistant also provides instructions on how to use each glue type, emphasizing proper ventilation and cleanup.
