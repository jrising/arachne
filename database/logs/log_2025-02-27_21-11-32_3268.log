On 2025-01-23, James inquired about an appropriate name for sections at the end of an academic paper, such as acknowledgments and code availability. I suggested "Supplementary Sections," but James pointed out potential confusion with "Supplemental Information," which he uses for his appendix. I then proposed alternatives like "End Matter" or "Final Sections" to avoid overlap and maintain clarity for readers. Additionally, I mentioned "Postscript" as a creative option, but emphasized the importance of clear terminology in academic writing. Ultimately, the goal was to ensure the sections were distinctly labeled without ambiguity.
