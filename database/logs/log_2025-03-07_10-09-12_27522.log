Sophie Schumaker reached out to Dr. James Rising for guidance on admissions to programs related to the School of Marine Science and Policy, expressing her interest in transitioning from a languages/international studies background to marine ecology. She is motivated despite lacking formal science degrees but has completed relevant coursework. In response, Dr. Rising suggested the Master's in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) at the University of Delaware as a suitable program due to its flexibility for non-traditional students. He acknowledged that the admission timeline for this year had ended and encouraged Sophie to consider applying in the future, also inviting her to inquire further as needed.
