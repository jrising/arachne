James inquired about creating a Plotly plot with three histograms. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions for both overlaying the histograms and displaying them side-by-side. For overlaying, she recommended setting the `barmode` to `'overlay'` and adjusting the `opacity` for better visualization, while for side-by-side histograms, setting the `barmode` to `'group'. Arachne highlighted the potential for further customization with colors, bin sizes, and layout options.
