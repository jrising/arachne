In the discussion, James inquires about the relationship between life expectancy and mortality rates. I explain that the relationship is not straightforward and caution against a simplistic one-to-one interpretation. While a mortality rate of \(1/100\) might suggest a life expectancy of 100 years, real-world mortality rates vary significantly by age, impacting life expectancy calculations. James then poses a follow-up question about whether an increase in total mortality rates would lead to a decrease in life expectancy. I affirm this is true, elaborating that higher mortality rates indicate more deaths in relation to the population, leading to a lower average life span. I highlight that results in life tables, age distributions, and health trends also play crucial roles in determining life expectancy.
