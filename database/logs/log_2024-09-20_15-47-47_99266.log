James requested an R script to extract a population grid for the contiguous U.S. from multiple `.asc` files, which was provided. He later asked for modifications to output the file as NetCDF and manage temporary directories for handling multiple zip files. The revised script saves the cropped raster as NetCDF, creates a temporary directory for processing each zip file, and deletes it after extraction. This efficient setup allows for handling a large list of zip files while ensuring temporary files are managed appropriately.
