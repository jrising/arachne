The discussion focused on aligning the proposed project, the Coastal Barometer, with the Delaware Sea Grant strategic plan for 2024-2028. Key areas of fit were identified across several functional work areas, including Coastal Community Resilience and Planning, Economic Development, Healthy Coastal Ecosystems, and Environmental Literacy. Specific priority areas and objectives were highlighted, such as enhancing understanding of coastal resilience, assessing local economic growth capacity, promoting habitat restoration, and improving environmental literacy. The Coastal Barometer aims to provide a comprehensive dashboard of data that supports strategic planning and sustainability, ultimately empowering coastal community leaders to make informed decisions. A detailed table was created to present these connections clearly, emphasizing the project's strategic relevance to the identified objectives.
