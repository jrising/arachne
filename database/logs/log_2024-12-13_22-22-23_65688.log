James asked how to extract a multiline block of text enclosed between triple backticks (```) in a Python string. I provided a solution using the `re` module, specifically the `re.findall()` function with a regular expression pattern that captures text between two sets of triple backticks. The example demonstrated the use of the `re.DOTALL` flag to allow the dot (`.`) to match newline characters, enabling the extraction of multiline text. The resulting matched blocks are returned as a list.
