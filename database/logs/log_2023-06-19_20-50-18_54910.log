In this discussion, James asked how to create a JavaScript text field that submits when the return key is pressed, but not when shift-return is pressed. The assistant provided a solution by adding an event listener to the text field and checking for the 'keydown' event, the return key, and the absence of the shift key. The assistant shared an HTML example with a form and JavaScript code that included the event listener. The listener prevented the default behavior and manually submitted the form when the conditions were met. This solution allows the text field to submit only when the return key is pressed without the shift key.
