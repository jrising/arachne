The conversation explored the worst-case number of "rounds" for a parallel odd-even sort of 6 elements, determining it to be 12 rounds in sequential computation. However, in parallel computation, each round can be conducted simultaneously, reducing the optimal time to 6 rounds. The odd-even sort, although efficient in parallel computation, is not recommended for large datasets due to the existence of more efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.
