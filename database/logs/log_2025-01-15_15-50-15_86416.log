In this conversation, James inquired about the NiGEM model, a macroeconomic tool developed by the NIESR, which is widely used for projecting economic developments. I explained its structure, reliance on a comprehensive dataset, system of equations, policy analysis capabilities, and the importance of modeling interconnected economies. James later asked whether he could download and run NiGEM, to which I clarified that I cannot do so, but he could not download it for free since it is proprietary software requiring a license from NIESR. I offered assistance in exploring alternatives if needed.
