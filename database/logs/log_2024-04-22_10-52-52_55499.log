James asked Arachne to map disciplines from a collection of CVs to fields in a survey of earned doctorates. Arachne provided heuristic mappings such as "Behavioral Decision Research" to Psychology, "Biology" to Biological, biomedical, and biosystems engineering, and "Doctoral degree with focus on sustainable development" to Sustainable development. Arachne noted variations in naming across disciplines and that some mappings might not be perfect. This mapping is suggested for a general reference and may need validation for specific uses.
