James assigned Felgenhauer & de Bruin's 2009 paper on climate change mitigation and adaptation to his class on Climate Change Economics. The paper explores optimal strategies under certainty and uncertainty, highlighting the importance of incorporating adaptation into climate policy alongside mitigation efforts. The AD-DICE model modifies the traditional DICE framework by explicitly including climate change adaptation. Key findings include lower optimal levels of mitigation and adaptation under uncertainty before learning occurs, and the impact of Climate Sensitivity variance on mitigation levels. Mitigation and adaptation are shown to be complementary strategies, with adaptation essential for an efficient and cost-effective response to climate change. The paper underscores the necessity of considering both mitigation and adaptation in climate policy for a sustainable future.
