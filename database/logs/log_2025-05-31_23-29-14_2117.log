In the discussion, James encountered a "Protocol Error (Page.navigate): Session closed" while using Pyppeteer to access URLs. The issue persisted despite `page.isClosed()` returning `False`. I provided various troubleshooting steps, including checking for premature page closure, ensuring proper code execution flow, managing timeouts, and verifying session integrity. When later faced with issues navigating to a different URL, we explored potential bot detection mechanisms by the target website, suggesting adjustments such as changing the User-Agent string, running in headed mode, and implementing delays between actions. Overall, the conversation focused on debugging navigation issues and the possibility of bot detection affecting access to certain sites.
