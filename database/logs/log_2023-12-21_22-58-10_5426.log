In a previous conversation, James asked how to save a map display from Matplotlib as a web-readable file. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions on using `plt.savefig()` to save the figure in various formats, such as PNG, PDF, SVG, and JPEG. The recommended format for web readability was PNG. Arachne explained the parameters `dpi` for adjusting the resolution and `bbox_inches` to fit the image bounds to the plot. Arachne also advised calling `plt.savefig()` before `plt.show()` to ensure the changes are reflected in the output. A code example was given to illustrate the process, and the necessity of importing the Matplotlib module was emphasized.
