The social cost of carbon (SCC) has become a cornerstone metric in climate economics, representing the estimated monetary value of the damages associated with an additional ton of CO2 emissions, including both market and non-market impacts. This review aims to elucidate the progress in understanding and applying the SCC, its critical role in policy-making, and avenues for future research.

Over the past decade, estimates of the SCC have significantly increased from $52 to $190 per ton of CO2, highlighting profound advancements in climate impact assessments and methodological rigor. These evolving estimates carry immense policy implications by influencing cost-benefit analyses of climate actions, effectively guiding mitigation strategies even in scenarios lacking full international cooperation.

However, substantial uncertainties and debates surround the SCC, stemming from predictions of long-term climate impacts, socio-economic trajectories, and ethical considerations in valuation methods. This review will delineate current disagreements and cutting-edge discussions, outlining the SCC’s foundational assumptions, the evolution of integrated assessment models, and the integration of risk assessment in climate policy.

Further, we will explore contemporary knowledge regarding SCC contributions across sectors and models, emphasizing essential factors such as discounting methodologies and their relation to economic theories. The future of SCC research involves tackling broader economic risks, cascading climate impacts, and the role of inequality.

Finally, this paper will scrutinize the SCC’s application in policy-making, spanning its historical journey and regional uses, while assessing its influence on carbon pricing frameworks and regional SCC applications. By providing a comprehensive examination of the SCC, this review seeks to guide policymakers in utilizing this metric amidst uncertainties, fostering informed decisions to mitigate climate change effectively.
