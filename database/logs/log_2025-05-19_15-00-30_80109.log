James inquired about calculating the mean and standard deviation of a column in a Julia `DataFrame` based on grouping from another column. I explained that this can be achieved using the `DataFrames` package with `groupby` and `combine` functions. I provided a step-by-step example starting from creating a sample data frame to applying the `groupby` and `combine` commands to compute the required statistics. The resulting data frame illustrates the mean and standard deviation for each group, demonstrating how to adapt the example to his specific data.
