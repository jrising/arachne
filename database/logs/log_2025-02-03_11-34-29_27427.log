This conversation focused on aligning the proposed Coastal Barometer project with the Delaware Sea Grant strategic plan. Key areas of discussion included identifying functional work areas, priority areas, and specific objectives from the strategic plan that the project addresses. The table created highlighted connections and included a column for end users. James requested the addition of specific organizations such as DNREC, Delaware DOT, and the Association of Coastal Towns (ACT) as end users, noting their relevance to the research's applicability. The integration of these organizations emphasized their roles in climate adaptation, infrastructure planning, and supporting healthy coastal ecosystems, alongside Delmarva Power's considerations for sustainable energy planning. The final outcome included a comprehensive overview demonstrating how the Coastal Barometer would serve multiple stakeholders by providing necessary data for strategic decision-making in coastal management.
