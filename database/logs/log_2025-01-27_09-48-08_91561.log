James inquired about processing a large zipped CSV file (2.7 GB) in R, aiming to aggregate data to a country-year level by averaging Monte Carlo results. I suggested using the `data.table::fread` function to read the file in chunks and compute averages efficiently. Later, James requested enhancements to include standard deviation computations and a grouping variable. I provided an updated code snippet to incorporate these features. However, James encountered an error with `fread` not recognizing `chunkSize`. I clarified that `fread` does not support `chunkSize`, recommending a method to read the file in chunks using `nrows` and `skip` instead. The revised code ensured proper processing without memory overload while allowing for the desired calculations and grouping.
