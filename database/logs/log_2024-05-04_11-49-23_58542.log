In a conversation with James's 3-year-old son, Austin, about his interests, Arachne shared a story featuring Emperor Palpatine. The tale revolved around Palpatine embarking on an adventure to retrieve a treasure stolen by a Dragon, which had the power to make “Austin’s” moon shine brighter. Arachne described Palpatine's journey in a spaceship and a duel with the Dragon using a red lightsaber, akin to a sword fight. The treasure was successfully retrieved, enhancing the moonlight. The discussion concluded with Arachne prompting Austin to imagine what happened next.
