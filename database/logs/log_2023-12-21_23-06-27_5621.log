In a previous conversation, James reported a problem with his flask application, which encountered an assertion failure and illegal hardware instruction that caused it to crash. Arachne identified the assertion failure as related to the macOS graphical user interface and the illegal hardware instruction as an unsupported instruction set. Arachne suggested updating the system software, checking Python and Flask versions, inspecting GUI operations, profiling the application, and investigating the semaphore issue as potential solutions. In a follow-up, James suspected that the issue was caused by matplotlib code. Arachne provided suggestions related to GUI interactions, compatibility issues, resource leaks, concurrency issues, and hardware or system instability. James was advised to set the correct backend for matplotlib, check the versions of dependencies, ensure proper cleanup of figure and axes objects, synchronize concurrency if applicable, and investigate hardware or system issues if the problem persists.
