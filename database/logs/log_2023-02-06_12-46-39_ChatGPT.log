In this conversation, James asks for a recommendation on which 30-page excerpt from Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" to assign to students in a philosophy of research class. Arachne suggests assigning the first chapter titled "The Route to Normal Science," as it provides a comprehensive overview of Kuhn's concept of "normal science" and sets the stage for the rest of the book. Arachne also highlights that this chapter introduces the broader philosophical implications of Kuhn's ideas for understanding scientific progress.
