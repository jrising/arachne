In a previous conversation, James requested assistance in writing criteria for selecting individuals in his professional network to receive holiday cards. I provided a list of six key criteria: 1) ongoing professional relationships, 2) those who made a significant impact on his work, 3) recent acquaintances from networking events, 4) key stakeholders in his field, 5) past mentors or significant colleagues, and 6) current or previous team members. I emphasized that the purpose of the holiday card is to maintain connections and express gratitude, suggesting that personalizing the message adds a genuine touch.
