The analysis provides estimates of damage to different sectors in terms of percentage of GDP for three time periods (2011-2030, 2041-2060, 2081-2100) under different policy trajectories. Notable findings include:

- **Drought & inland flooding losses**: Under current policies, impacts are expected to be 0.6% [0.1% - 1.2%] of GDP by the end of the century. High mitigation policies could reduce these impacts to 0.1% [-0.02% - 0.3%], avoiding 0.4% [-0.1% - 0.7%] of GDP.
- **Agriculture losses**: Best estimates suggest small negative impacts on agriculture, ranging from -0.01% to 0.33% of GDP, with no significant difference between policy trajectories.
- **Coastal impacts**: Coastal damages are estimated to range from -0.04% to 0.97% of GDP. High mitigation policies reduce impacts by 0.2% [-0.5% - 0.6%] compared to current policies.
- **Trade losses**: Trade losses range from 0.23% to 3.17% of GDP. Implementing high mitigation policies would substantially reduce these losses, by 0.71% [0.1% - 1.9%] to 2.06% [0.6% - 3.2%].
- **Catastrophic damage risk**: The largest losses at end-of-century are from catastrophic risks, estimated at 4.1% [-2.8% - 11.9%] under current policies. Following a high mitigation pathway could reduce these impacts by 2.9 pp [-2.0 pp - 8.6 pp].
