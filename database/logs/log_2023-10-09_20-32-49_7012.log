This section discusses the outcomes and challenges of recent rebuilding efforts in fisheries. While some ecosystems have seen reductions in exploitation rates, there is an overall trend of stock depletion. The section highlights the trade-off between short-term yields and conservation measures or selective targeting to protect vulnerable species. It notes that the analysis focuses on scientifically assessed and researched fisheries, leaving out small-scale fisheries that are harder to track and manage. Successful rebuilding efforts involve local communities in co-management arrangements and employ tools like closed areas and gear restrictions. Various management tools for rebuilding fisheries are identified, including gear restrictions, closed areas, reductions in fishing capacity, catch shares, and community co-management. The section also addresses challenges such as resistance from fisheries-dependent communities and the problem of unreported and illegal fishing. It emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and better global oversight to ensure the sustainability and conservation of marine resources.
