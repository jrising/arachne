James sought assistance with the Web Speech API, expressing that upon pressing a button to start it, the API triggered an `onstart` event followed by `onend` quickly, resulting in no recordings. I provided several troubleshooting steps, including checking microphone permissions, enabling continuous mode on the recognition instance, implementing logic to restart recognition after `onend`, ensuring a stable internet connection, and adding comprehensive logging for debugging. Additionally, I stressed browser compatibility and the importance of error handling to capture potential issues. These strategies aimed to resolve his challenges with the API effectively.
