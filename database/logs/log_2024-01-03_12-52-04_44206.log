In a previous conversation, James asked about the tradition of putting out shoes as kids and waking up to find them filled with chocolate coins. Arachne informed him that this tradition is typically associated with St. Nicholas' Day on December 6th. However, James mentioned that his family celebrates this tradition in January. Arachne suggested that this could be related to the Feast of the Epiphany, also known as Three Kings' Day, which is celebrated on January 6th. Arachne explained that on this day, children often put out their shoes the night before and find them filled with gifts and sweets in the morning, symbolizing the gifts of the Three Wise Men to the baby Jesus. Arachne advised James to confirm with his family if it's the Epiphany celebration they are referring to, as traditions can vary.
