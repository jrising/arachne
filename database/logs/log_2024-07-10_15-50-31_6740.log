James received a request related to the United Nations Nippon Foundation Fellowship 2025 from Dr. Zeb, with a background in horticulture, seeking support. James, not specialized in horticulture, revised a draft email response to kindly express that the proposal did not align with his expertise. The revised email suggested seeking support from other individuals or organizations better suited to provide advocacy. This exchange showcases James's professionalism and consideration for others' aspirations, even when he cannot offer direct support in their field.
