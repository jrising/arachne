In the discussion, James inquired about the existence of a rift valley in Africa despite it not being located where tectonic plates meet. I explained that the East African Rift is formed by continental rifting, driven by extensional tectonic forces that pull the lithosphere apart. This process results in crust thinning and faulting, leading to the creation of rift valleys. I highlighted the active geological processes involved, including mantle dynamics and ongoing rifting that signify the early stages of ocean basin formation. Additionally, I noted that the East African Rift is unique due to its volcanic and seismic activity, as well as its role as a biodiversity hotspot stemming from the environmental changes it created.
