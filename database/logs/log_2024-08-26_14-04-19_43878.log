James inquired about using total column ozone (TCO) as a proxy for ground-level ozone exposure. The AI explained that TCO measures ozone from the surface to the edge of space, not reflecting ground-level exposure. Ground-level ozone, affecting health and the environment, is formed close to the surface from various sources. Local pollution, weather, and geography affect ground-level ozone differently from TCO. To assess exposure accurately, direct measurement from ground-based stations is necessary, rather than relying on TCO. For reliable evaluation, specific tropospheric ozone data is recommended over total column values.
