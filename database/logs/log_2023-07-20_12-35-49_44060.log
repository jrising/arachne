In a previous conversation, James asked about the stylized picture of concentric commercial, industrial, and residential regions described by urban geography. The assistant explained that this picture corresponds to the "Concentric Zone Model" or "Burgess Model," which suggests that cities develop in concentric rings around a central business district (CBD). The breakdown of zones includes the CBD, the zone of transition, the zone of working-class homes, the zone of better residences, and the commuter zone. James then inquired about the placement of heavy industry and commercial stores within this model. The assistant clarified that the original model does not account for these specific land uses but provided common scenarios. Heavy industries are typically located in designated industrial zones outside the concentric rings, close to transportation infrastructure. Commercial stores are concentrated in or near the CBD, with possible extension into adjacent zones. The assistant also mentioned that modern urban planning considers more complex factors to create sustainable and livable environments.
