In a previous conversation, James asked for alternatives to a pie chart for visually representing how several parts combine to make a whole. The assistant provided a list of alternatives, including bar charts, stacked bar charts, column charts, stacked column charts, donut charts, treemaps, waffle charts, area charts, Sankey diagrams, and pictogram charts. The assistant noted that the best option depends on the specific data and audience.
