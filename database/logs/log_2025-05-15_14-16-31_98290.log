James asked about the cost of installing shutters or shading for UK housing stock, specifically per house. I explained that costs vary based on factors like type, size, material, and installation complexity. Interior shutters can cost between £150 and £300 per window, while exterior shutters may range from £500 to £1,500 per window. Blinds and shades are generally cheaper, costing £50 to £200 per window. I noted that professional installation could add £50 to £100 per window. For an average 3-bedroom home with 8-10 windows, total costs could be approximately £1,200 to £3,000 for interior shutters and £500 to £1,500 for blinds. I recommended getting multiple quotes for a tailored estimate and highlighted potential energy savings and aesthetic improvements that could enhance long-term value.
