The conversation revolved around coordinate systems and projections in geospatial data analysis. James initially asked about the projection coordinate system in Global Gridded Climate Models (GCMs). Arachne clarified that GCMs are typically modelled on a global spherical coordinate system with latitude and longitude. When it comes to visualizing or analyzing the data, it may be projected onto a 2D map using map projection systems like WGS84 or UTM. James then inquired if data specified in latitude/longitude requires a coordinate projection system. Arachne explained that latitude and longitude are spherical coordinates that do not require a projection system when used to reference a location on Earth's surface. However, when visualizing or analyzing data on a 2D map, coordinate projection systems are used to transform spherical coordinates into Cartesian (x, y) coordinates. This enables the representation of Earth's surface on a 2D map, taking into account distortions caused by flattening the curved surface.
