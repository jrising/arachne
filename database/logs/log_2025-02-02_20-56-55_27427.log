James inquired whether all countries could build nuclear power plants. I outlined key considerations influencing this capability, including technical expertise and infrastructure, financial resources, regulatory and legal frameworks, political will and public acceptance, compliance with international treaties, geographical and environmental factors, and supply chain stability. Ultimately, while many countries could technically pursue nuclear power, practical implementation relies on a combination of these factors. Some nations may opt for alternative energy sources better suited to their specific resources and capabilities.
