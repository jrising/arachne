James wants to set up a Flask app served under Passenger to return immediately while processing continues in the background, so that client-side JavaScript can monitor the progress. I explain that he can achieve this by using a task queue like RQ or Celery, installing the necessary packages, adding tasks to the Flask application, setting up a queue with Redis as a backend, running workers to process tasks, and using shared, persistent storage to maintain shared state. I emphasize the need to avoid starting long-running tasks directly in Flask and provide links to the documentation for Celery and RQ.
