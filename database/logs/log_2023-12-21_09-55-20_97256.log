This conversation involved James requesting a summary of the statements of purpose from three applicants for the Marine Policy Graduate program at the University of Delaware. The conversation included an initial summary of each applicant's statement of purpose, which highlighted their faculty mentions, research interests, quantitative capacity, UD specificity, writing fluency, growth, and DEI discussions. James then requested a shortened version of the summary table, specifically focusing on the "Quantitative capacity" column. The final table provided a concise summary of each applicant's information, including the adjusted "Quantitative capacity" column using keywords from the original rubric.
