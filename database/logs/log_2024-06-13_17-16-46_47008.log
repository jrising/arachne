James encountered a `DimensionMismatch` error in Julia due to broadcasting issues when trying to assign the result of `argmin` to a subarray. The solution involved extracting integers from `CartesianIndex` objects returned by `argmin` to match the dimensions correctly. By using a list comprehension to access the `.I` field of each `CartesianIndex` object, James was able to populate `strat[:, Fi]` with integers derived from the `argmin` operation, resolving the type conversion problem and successfully assigning values to the subarray.
