The conversation discussed the use of non-informative priors in Bayesian models with Gaussian variables. The assistant explained that while non-informative priors express a lack of prior knowledge, a prior distribution must still be specified for Bayesian inference. Broad, flat priors, such as a wide Normal distribution for the mean (`mu`) and a log-uniform or Half-Normal distribution for the standard deviation (`sigma`), are commonly used when no prior information is available. The assistant also mentioned the inverse-chi-square distribution as a common choice for a non-informative prior on variance parameters like `sigma^2`. The debate regarding what truly constitutes a non-informative prior was mentioned, with some statisticians preferring flat priors and others arguing for the maximum entropy represented by the inverse-chi-square distribution. The importance of testing the sensitivity of results to the choice of prior and updating beliefs based on new evidence in Bayesian statistics was highlighted.
