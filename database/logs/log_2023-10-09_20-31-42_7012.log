This paper discusses the use of models to analyze the effects of exploitation rates on fish populations, communities, and ecosystems. It describes how single-species models determine the exploitation rate that provides maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and introduces multispecies models that predict the effects of exploitation on species composition, size structure, and biomass. The paper shows that increasing exploitation rates initially increase fish catch but eventually lead to overfishing and the collapse of species. It presents the results of an analysis of 10 large marine ecosystems, which found that exploitation rates that avoid 10% collapse rates were lower than the MMSY rates. The paper also discusses scientific stock assessments, research trawl surveys, and global fisheries catches, highlighting declining biomass, changes in species composition, and increases in species collapses over time. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of reducing exploitation rates to ensure sustainability and avoid species collapses.
