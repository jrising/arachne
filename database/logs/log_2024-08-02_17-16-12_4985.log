James sought help in Julia with comparing tuples in a DataFrame column as a whole rather than element-wise. The assistant provided a solution using the `==` operator with `.@.` to broadcast the comparison correctly. By defining the tuple to find and using broadcasting, James could identify rows matching a specific tuple in the DataFrame. The assistant demonstrated this using an example with a sample DataFrame, showing how to find and view the matched rows either as a boolean array or a filtered DataFrame.
