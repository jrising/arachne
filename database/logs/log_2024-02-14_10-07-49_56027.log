Abdulbaki Ubandawaki reached out to Dr. Xinfeng Liang, expressing his desire to know the status of his application for the PhD program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. In his response, Dr. Liang informed Abdulbaki that no faculty members had expressed interest in recruiting him at that time. He offered to keep Abdulbaki's application in the pool until April 15th when final decisions would be made. Abdulbaki followed up, expressing his eagerness for a decision and mentioning that he had been waiting for almost three months. In James' drafted response, he informed Abdulbaki that unfortunately, University funding had not been secured for his PhD journey. He offered the option to transfer his application to the Environmental Economics Masters program, which is self-funded. James extended an invitation to further discuss Abdulbaki's situation through a zoom chat.
