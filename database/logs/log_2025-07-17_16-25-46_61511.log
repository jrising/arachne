James sought to articulate a mathematical relationship involving the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and discount rates, specifically, how SCC_a/SCC_b approximately equals discount rate_b/discount rate_a. I confirmed that SCC is inversely proportional to the discount rate. I suggested a detailed explanation emphasizing the implications of different discount rates on SCC. When he requested a shorter version, I proposed a more concise statement. James wanted to maintain clarity about the inverse ratio relationship, so I provided the final phrasing: "The ratios of SCCs are inversely proportional to the ratios of discount rates."
