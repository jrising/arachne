James asked how to extract individual words from a string in R using regex. I provided two methods: using `strsplit()` with a regex that matches whitespaces to split the string into words or using stringr library's `str_extract_all()` with a regex `"\\b\\w+\\b"` to extract complete words. Both methods ensure distinct words are extracted without partial matches. James was able to use these examples to extract words from his strings in R for further analysis or processing.
