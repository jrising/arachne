James sought guidance on extracting a bounding box from a shapefile using Python. I recommended using the `geopandas` library for its efficiency in handling geospatial operations. I provided a concise step-by-step process that included installing `geopandas`, reading the shapefile into a GeoDataFrame, and using the `total_bounds` property to obtain the bounding box as a NumPy array. I detailed the output format as `[minx, miny, maxx, maxy]`, representing the bounding rectangle's coordinates. I also encouraged James to reach out with any specific requirements or issues he might encounter.
