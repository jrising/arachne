Drawing from a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018), this synopsis summarizes key issues and data requirements for fisheries management relevant to Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. The issues include understanding fishing productivity, economic importance of fishing areas, future commercial fishing trends, management of protected species and fishing quotas, avoiding disturbance to fishing areas, and engaging fishing industry stakeholders. The data requirements encompass jurisdictions and regulated areas, abundance and distribution of marine species, oceanographic parameters, commercial fishing effort through Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and Vessel Trip Reports (VTR), vessel traffic through Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), human and cultural use areas, bathymetry, sand and borrow sites, species and habitat locations (including benthic habitat), water quality, geophysical characteristics, climate projections, and traditional ecological knowledge. Identifying and addressing these data gaps will facilitate more effective spatial planning in Delaware's ocean and bay areas. [REFERENCE: Dewberry Engineers (2018)]
