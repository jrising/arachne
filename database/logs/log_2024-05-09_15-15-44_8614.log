James assigned the reading "Evolution of the International Climate Change Policy and Processes: UNFCCC to Paris Agreement" by Naser et al. (2022) for his Climate Change Economics class. The reading highlights the evolution of international climate change governance, from the UNFCCC to the Paris Agreement, emphasizing the shift towards a bottom-up approach in setting emission targets. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to 2°C, with efforts to reach 1.5°C. The Kyoto Protocol, although criticized for not compelling emissions reductions from major developing nations, played a role in advancing market-based flexible mechanisms. Key concepts include the North-South divide in climate negotiations and the role of international agreements in driving climate litigation against corporations and financial institutions. Multiple-choice questions were provided to assess student engagement with the reading.
