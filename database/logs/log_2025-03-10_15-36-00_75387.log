James inquired about which parts of the US government are required to conduct cost-benefit analysis (CBA), particularly in relation to the social cost of carbon (SCC). I explained that federal executive agencies must perform CBAs under Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 for significant regulatory actions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidelines through Circular A-4, recommending the use of SCC for regulations affecting greenhouse gas emissions. While independent agencies like the Federal Reserve and SEC are not strictly bound by these orders, many still perform CBAs. The SCC, developed through an interagency process, helps monetize climate-related costs and is used variably across agencies based on their regulatory focus. Overall, CBA is essential for decision-making related to environmental, health, and safety regulations.
