In a conversation about scheduling calendar invites with Zoom links using Google's features, James sought clarification on how to delay the sending of invites. I explained the steps to create a Google Calendar event without immediately inviting guests and suggested composing a separate email with details while scheduling it for future delivery. James expressed concern about the calendar invites simply sending emails as attachments, aiming for a solution that mimicked that exact effect. I outlined a process for composing an email with the meeting details, scheduling it, and then adding guests to the event separately to ensure invites were sent at his desired time. This approach allows for effective communication without immediate notifications to invitees.
