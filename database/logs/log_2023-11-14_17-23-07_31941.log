The email from Min Thura Mon expresses strong interest in the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program at the University of Delaware. They have a background in economics and environmental management, with a focus on environmental and energy economics in Southeast Asia. They are particularly interested in the economics of environmental and resource policy, climate change impacts, and poverty in the region. Arachne responds, acknowledging their research interests and academic background, and recommends mentioning James Rising in their statement of purpose due to the alignment of their research interests. Arachne notes that funding for the program is limited, especially for international applicants, but encourages Mon to apply by the end of the calendar year. Arachne also mentions the possibility of remote work, considering Mon is currently studying in Thailand.
