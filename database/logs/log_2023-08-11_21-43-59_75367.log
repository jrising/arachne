The discussion focused on identifying resources and activities that should be considered for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. The key resources and activities discussed were:

1. North and South Firing Ranges: Former artillery ranges utilized by the Delaware National Guard that may contain unexploded ordinances (UXOs).

2. NASA Wallops Flight Facility: A NASA facility on Virginia's Eastern Seashore that launches rockets and balloons and has radar operations that could be impacted by wind projects.

3. Historic Places: Several coastal properties in Delaware with historical significance that may be affected by wind turbines. Consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) may be required.

4. Assateague Island National Seashore: A national seashore off the coasts of Virginia and Maryland, which may require a scenic buffer if wind projects conflict with public outdoor recreation.

5. Archaeological Shipwrecks and Delaware Antiquities: Known shipwrecks and archaeological resources along the Delaware/Maryland coast that must be maintained and protected during construction projects.

6. Native American Artifacts: The potential discovery of Native American artifacts during construction, requiring ceasing construction and obtaining a federal permit for removal.

These resources and activities will inform the development of the Ocean & Bay Plan by taking into account their spatial extent, stakeholders, and potential impacts.
