The discussion focused on identifying resources and activities that need to be considered for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. The identified resources and activities include former firing ranges, the NASA Wallops Flight Facility, historic places, Assateague Island National Seashore, archaeological shipwrecks, and potential native American artifacts. The implications of these resources and activities on offshore wind energy development were discussed, including potential risks of unexploded ordinances, radar impacts, and visual conflicts. The consultation process with relevant stakeholders, such as Delaware State, Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs, State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, was also outlined.
