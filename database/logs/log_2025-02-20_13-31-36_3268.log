In a discussion about running a Python code snippet using `exec`, James encountered a "NameError: name 'keywords' is not defined." I explained that this could stem from issues with incomplete code execution in `exec`, typographical errors, or execution context. To troubleshoot, I provided an example of how the complete code should be structured within a single string. Additionally, I suggested checking for scope issues if the code is called inside a function. The focus was on ensuring that the entire code, from import to the last statement, was included in the `exec` call for successful execution.
