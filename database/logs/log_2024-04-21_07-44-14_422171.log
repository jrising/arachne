James recalled a "huge yellow bookstore cafe" in Connecticut that offers free books with food, but struggled to find it. I suggested it might be The Book Barn in Niantic, known for its barn-like setting but not typically described as a cafe offering free books. James clarified that itâ€™s definitely a cafe with free books. I then identified "Book Barn & Cafe" in Niantic as the potential place, emphasizing its cozy atmosphere and the opportunity to browse books while enjoying food. I also recommended checking current operating hours and guidelines, particularly due to pandemic-related changes.
