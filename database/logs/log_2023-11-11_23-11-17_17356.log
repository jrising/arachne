In a previous conversation, James asked about issues with his TTS tool that was only reading the first and last sentences. The AI assistant suggested that the issue may be related to the `pygame.mixer.Sound` objects being garbage collected before they finished playing. A revised version of the code was provided, which stored the `Sound` objects in a list to prevent premature garbage collection. However, James reported that the issue persisted and requested clarification on the function's setup and the purpose of `task_done()` and the infinite loop. The AI assistant explained that `task_done()` signals the completion of a previously enqueued task, and the infinite loop is used to continuously process sentences from the queue. To address James' concerns and enable a clean exit from the loop, the AI assistant provided a new version of the code that introduced an `exit_flag` variable and a timeout for other code execution. It also cleaned up any remaining `Sound` objects before exiting the function. James was asked to try the revised code and provide feedback.
