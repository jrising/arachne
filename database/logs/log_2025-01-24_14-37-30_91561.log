The discussion focused on a grant proposal addressing the economic and fiscal risks of climate damage in the UK and the benefits of adaptation actions. James emphasized the need for high-resolution impact estimates for local adaptation, highlighting variability and uncertainty in damage estimates under different warming scenarios. Key points from responses included the importance of incorporating granular data from the Met Office through Project Delta and improving adaptation benefit evidence. The conversation concluded with plans for collaboration across multiple teams, reaffirming the project's objectives of integrating sector models into a macro-modelling framework like NiGEM while ensuring transparency and accessibility of data for policymakers. The next steps involve further engagement with stakeholders to finalize the project scope and refine the grant proposal.
