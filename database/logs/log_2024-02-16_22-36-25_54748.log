James inquired about the distinction between "spatial" and "geospatial" datasets. Arachne explained that while the terms are often used interchangeably, there are nuances. "Spatial data" is a broader category encompassing any data with a spatial relationship, not limited to Earth's surface. In contrast, "geospatial data" specifically pertains to location on Earth, including geographic coordinates. Arachne clarified that while geospatial data is a subset of spatial data, not all spatial data is geospatial. This distinction helps understand the varying scopes of location-based information in datasets.
