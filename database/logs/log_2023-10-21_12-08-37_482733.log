In a previous conversation, James asked about the modes of transportation used for imports into the US, and the relative shares of those modes. Arachne responded that the primary modes of transportation for imports include ocean freight, air freight, trucking, and rail freight. Ocean freight is the most common method for importing goods, accounting for around 71% of total US import value in 2020. Air freight accounts for approximately 16% of the total import value and is used for high-value and time-sensitive goods. Trucking plays a vital role in distributing imported goods within the US, while rail freight has a lesser share compared to the other modes. The relative shares can vary depending on factors such as the type of goods, location, and global trade dynamics.
