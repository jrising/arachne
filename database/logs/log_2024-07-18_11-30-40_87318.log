James sought to retrieve the total size of a box and its children in a Google TreeMap when clicked. Arachne advised using the `select` event, providing a code snippet to demonstrate this. The solution involved listening for the event, extracting selected data, and calculating the total size using a custom function. Arachne highlighted the flexibility to tailor the `calculateTotalSize` function to fit the data structure. This guidance empowered James to enhance interactivity and user experience within his TreeMap visualization tool.
