James recalled a music video by The Beatles released after their breakup, featuring John Lennon singing in a ghostly manner, around 1995. I clarified that he was referring to "Free as a Bird," part of the "Anthology" project. The song, originally a demo from 1977, was completed by Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. I explained how the music video utilized archival footage to create the illusion of Lennonâ€™s presence, aligning with his description of a ghostly appearance. This project was a unique way to reconnect the band, even posthumously.
