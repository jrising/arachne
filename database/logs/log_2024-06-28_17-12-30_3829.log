James inquired about finding the minimum value of a specified column in Google Sheets using an index. I guided him on using the `INDEX` and `MIN` functions, providing a step-by-step explanation and an example formula. The process involved identifying the data range, specifying the column with `INDEX`, and finding the minimum value with `MIN`. James was encouraged to adapt the formula to his needs and seek clarification if required.
