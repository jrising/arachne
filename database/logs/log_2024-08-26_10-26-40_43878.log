James sought alternative terms for classifying datasets as "old" (> 10 years since an update) and "coarse" (> 10km resolution) without negative connotations. Arachne suggested alternatives like "Legacy," "Historical," "Mature," and "Archived" for "old" datasets, and options such as "Broad-scale," "Low-resolution," or "Macro-scale" for "coarse" datasets. These alternatives aim to convey the classification clearly while avoiding potential misinterpretations.
