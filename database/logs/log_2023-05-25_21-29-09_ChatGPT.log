The conclusion highlights the importance of Delaware's coastal economy and its significant contributions to the state's overall economic health. The diverse range of industries within the coastal economy, such as real estate, tourism, and healthcare, showcase its dynamic and adaptable nature. The coastal economy's exceptional growth over the past decade and its resilience highlight its potential for sustained prosperity. The economic contributions of coastal activities extend beyond direct economic output to stimulate job creation and generate substantial tax revenue. Investing in coastal resilience, through a combination of hard, soft, and hybrid projects, is crucial for long-term growth and adaptability. The development of a "Coastal Barometer" can provide a holistic understanding of the coastal economy's health and guide informed decision-making. Future research should focus on implementing the Coastal Barometer and deepening the understanding of climate change impacts and disaster preparedness in order to support the resilience and prosperity of Delaware's coastal economy.
