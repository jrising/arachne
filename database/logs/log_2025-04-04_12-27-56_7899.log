James encountered an issue using `parLapply` from the parallel package in R, where the variable `trade.method` was reported as not found when sourced in a separate script. Initially, he was confused about the variable scoping, believing that local variables within the worker environment were accessible after sourcing. After some discussion, it became clear that sourcing only accesses the global environment of each worker. James diagnosed the issue correctly when he noted that using the global assignment operator `<<-` allowed `trade.method` to be accessible, confirming that each worker indeed gets its own global environment, thus avoiding variable clobbering. This solution proved effective, allowing him to proceed without errors.
