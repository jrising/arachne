James inquired about how to add a GitHub repository as a submodule to a Git repository. I provided a detailed step-by-step guide, which included navigating to the root directory of the existing repository, using the `git submodule add` command with the appropriate URL and path, initializing and cloning the submodule, and committing the changes to track the submodule. I also specified how to push changes to the remote repository and update the submodule whenever the upstream repository has updates. Finally, I mentioned the importance of using the `--recurse-submodules` flag when cloning a repository with submodules.
