The Coastal Barometer is tailored to benefit various end users, including community officials, resource managers, private sector businesses, and educational professionals. Community officials will utilize the comprehensive data to inform land-use planning and enhance resilience against climate change impacts. Resource managers will leverage insights to improve conservation strategies and resource management. Private sector businesses, particularly in tourism and aquaculture, will enhance strategic planning using the data to identify opportunities and mitigate risks. Educational institutions will incorporate the Barometer's data into curricula to advance environmental literacy. The need for this research has been communicated through the Delaware Sea Grant strategic planning process, with input from state and local officials, as well as feedback from partnerships with relevant organizations and industry stakeholders.
