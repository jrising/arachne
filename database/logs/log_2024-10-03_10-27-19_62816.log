In the conversation, Peal Ahamed Shanto expressed his interest in transferring to the Department of Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware after previously applying without success. James Rising acknowledged Peal's strong application but mentioned funding constraints that limited opportunities for new students. He offered to keep Peal's information in the pool for future openings, and Peal was grateful for this consideration. After several follow-ups from Peal, James informed him that new applications must be submitted each year and recommended waiting until the end of the month for clarity on funding before applying again. James also offered a Zoom meeting for further discussion.
