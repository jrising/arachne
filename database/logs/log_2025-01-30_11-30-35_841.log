James requested assistance in writing a short script for a phone conversation aimed at existing corporate supporters of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) to help with gap funding due to recent executive orders. I provided a concise script that included an introduction expressing gratitude for support, a transition to the request for gap funding, a highlight of the impact their support could make, an appeal for additional help, and a closing statement. The script was crafted to be direct and compelling while allowing for personal customization based on relationships with the supporters.
