In a previous conversation, James requested assistance in shaping a funding proposal for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) aimed at securing $200,000 from the McKnight Foundation. The discussion focused on emphasizing IMT's role in designing and implementing Building Performance Standards (BPS) to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, which represent over 70% of U.S. electricity usage. I suggested restructuring the proposal to align with McKnight's goals, enhancing its focus on the Midwest and detailing IMT's previous successes in the region. Key strategies included conducting research, providing technical assistance, and disseminating model laws. Attachments for the application included financial documents and strategic plans to support decision-making, emphasizing potential progress towards a cumulative reduction of 15 million metric tons of CO2e by 2040.
