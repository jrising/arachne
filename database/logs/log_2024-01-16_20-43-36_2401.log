James asked for a term to describe a methodology that studies multiple steps in a process independently and then builds a stronger view of them based on the fact that they build upon each other. The term "cumulative" was suggested by Arachne, which implies that each step or level of the analysis is building upon the previous one. The term "cumulative" captures the idea that each step adds depth and complexity to the overall analysis. The suggested term was incorporated into the sentence provided by James, which now reads, "The use of both model-based and statistical approaches across these three cumulative levels of analysis provides multiple lines of evidence."
