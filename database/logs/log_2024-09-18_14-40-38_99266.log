Md Abedur Rahman, a prospective Ph.D. student, contacted James Rising expressing interest in the Environmental Economics program. James acknowledged Md's strong profile in climate change and food waste policy, encouraging him to apply early due to limited funding. Md followed up, requesting James as his advisor and a meeting to discuss research alignment. James welcomed Md to list him as an advisor but suggested considering other potential advisors for funding flexibility. He invited Md to schedule a meeting to explore their alignment further. The conversation reflects a positive exchange and potential collaboration between Md and James in the Ph.D. program at the University of Delaware.
