James sought assistance in matching tax data provided by a county in Delaware with corresponding categories in the IMPLAN model. The discussion focused on aligning county data such as realty transfer tax, building permits, fire fees, and property tax with IMPLAN categories. Considerations were made for items like dividends, corporate profits tax, and personal taxes. It was clarified that Delaware has no sales tax, advising James to exclude it from the analysis. Recommendations included seeking clarity from the county on categorizations and mapping non-matching items. James was encouraged to proceed with the analysis, dropping sales tax from consideration.
