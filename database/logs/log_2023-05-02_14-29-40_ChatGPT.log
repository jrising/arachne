James asked if he could use R's raster's `disaggregate` function on the time dimension of a `RasterStack` to duplicate each time's value within each grid cell multiple times. I informed him that `disaggregate` is primarily designed for spatial disaggregation and provided an alternative approach. I suggested manually creating a new `RasterStack` with the desired number of layers and copying the values from the original one. I provided example code to illustrate this process. James can determine the number of layers in the original stack and set the desired duplication factor. By running the code, he will obtain a new `RasterStack` with each time's value duplicated according to the specified factor. I also mentioned that higher duplication factors and larger numbers of layers will require more memory.
