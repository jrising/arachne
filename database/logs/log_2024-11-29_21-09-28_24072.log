The discussion focused on the relationship between installed capacity and costs in green technologies and the frictions that add hidden costs to the adoption of abatement technologies. Key phrases included "learning curves," which describe how costs decrease with increased cumulative capacity; "experience curves," emphasizing cost reductions from manufacturing experience; and "economies of scale," which highlight efficiency gains. Additionally, phrases like "implementation barriers," "transaction costs," and "inertia" were noted as factors causing hidden costs in adopting technologies. Frictions such as "risk perception" and "regulatory uncertainty" further complicate the adoption process. Overall, the conversation explored how understanding these relationships and frictions is essential for effectively transitioning to sustainable energy solutions.
