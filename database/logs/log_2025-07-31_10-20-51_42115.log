James is writing a report for Ministries of Finance on climate change adaptation investments, focusing on Brazil as a case study. He seeks high-level, exciting narratives that could attract international funding, akin to his previous work on Bangladesh. I provided several angles, including agroforestry, renewable energy, urban resilience, and sustainable Amazon development, emphasizing their economic benefits and resilience gains. James also introduced the idea of exploring how Brazil can integrate adaptation, decarbonization, and development while overcoming coordination challenges to attract private finance, particularly relevant to COP30. I suggested topics such as integrated climate policies, innovative financial instruments, ecosystem-based adaptation, and cross-sector collaboration, framing these narratives to highlight their potential to unlock private investment and foster sustainable growth in Brazil.
