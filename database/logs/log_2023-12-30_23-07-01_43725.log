In a previous conversation, James asked how to create a button on a webpage that uses jQuery to slide a textarea into view and toggle its visibility. Arachne provided HTML and jQuery code for achieving this functionality. The HTML structure includes a button with a title and a triangle symbol that flips down and back to the right on click. The jQuery code uses the slideToggle() method to slide the textarea up and down and manipulates the arrow symbol to change its orientation based on the visibility of the textarea. Arachne also mentioned the need to include relevant CSS for proper alignment of the title and arrow. The conversation concluded with a request for James to modify the code as per his webpage's CSS and requirements.
