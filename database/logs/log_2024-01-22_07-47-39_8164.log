James asked for a tool that would allow his baby to type on his computer in a locked mode, where the baby can see their actions on the screen without accidentally making changes. The assistant recommended using AlphaBaby, an application that locks the keyboard and allows the baby to press keys, triggering fun responses without affecting other work or settings. James was advised to download AlphaBaby from the Mac App Store, grant necessary permissions, and lock the screen using the "Lock Screen" button or the shortcut "Command+L". To unlock, he can press "Command+Q". The assistant also emphasized the importance of saving open work and closing important applications before giving the baby access to the keyboard with AlphaBaby running.
