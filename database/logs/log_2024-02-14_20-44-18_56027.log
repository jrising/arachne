In a previous conversation, James asked if "overheads" includes both fringe benefits and Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs in a budget plan. Arachne responded that yes, "overheads" typically includes both fringe benefits and F&A costs. Arachne then explained that fringe benefits encompass employee-related expenses like health insurance and retirement benefits, while F&A costs include expenses for common or joint objectives that cannot be easily identified with a specific project, such as utilities and administrative services. Arachne also mentioned that these costs are often calculated as a percentage of the total direct costs of a project, and the specific percentages can vary by organization and project type.
