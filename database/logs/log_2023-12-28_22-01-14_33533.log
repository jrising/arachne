This blog post discusses a student paper on the impact of ecotourism on Florida Keys coral reefs. The paper highlights the importance of coral reefs in providing ecosystem services and supporting tourism, while also highlighting the threats they face from climate change and human activities. A dynamic coupled system model is used to analyze the effects of ecotourism and normal tourism on coral health and cover, showing that rising sea surface temperatures lead to increased bleaching rates and decreased coral cover. However, the study also demonstrates that appropriate levels of ecotourism funding can mitigate these effects through conservation efforts. The findings have policy implications for balancing tourism and coral conservation, suggesting the allocation of resources from ecotourism revenue for restoration and conservation strategies. Keywords: Coral reefs, ecotourism, sea surface temperature, bleaching, conservation, tourism revenue, dynamic coupled system model.
