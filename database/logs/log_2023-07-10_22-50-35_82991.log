In this conversation, James is seeking assistance in creating a structured interview template for a research project focused on identifying data gaps and understanding stakeholder usage and information needs related to the Delaware Bay and nearby ocean. The assistant provides a structured interview template with 13 specific questions and prompts for each section: aspects of utilization and relevance, information needs, data gaps, future outlook, and other feedback. The template includes an introduction, specific questions on usage and data sources, identification of data gaps, and an unstructured section for open discussion. The assistant advises James to adjust the script as needed to fit the context and desired tone.
