The conversation involved Damodar Gautam inquiring about PhD opportunities in James Rising's research group. Damodar expressed his background in Agr-Economics and interest in climate change modeling, referencing James' work. James encouraged Damodar to apply for the Fall 2025 term, noting funding constraints, and clarified that the program does not require GRE scores. Damodar later submitted his application materials and sought updates, to which James unfortunately replied that due to policy changes, no funding was available for PhD candidates this year. James suggested exploring a Master's program instead, leading to Damodar expressing continued interest but reiterating the need for funding support. Ultimately, James appreciated Damodar's enthusiasm and promised to inform him of future opportunities.
