India has been identified as the country with the fastest growing emissions, attributed to its rapidly growing economy and population, vulnerability to natural disasters, dependence on agriculture, rapid urbanization, and reliance on fossil fuels. It also has the largest number of poor people among all countries, with poverty defined as the inability to meet basic needs for survival. Factors contributing to climate vulnerability among the poor in India include lack of access to resources and basic services, dependence on vulnerable natural resources, limited ability to adapt to climate change impacts, high levels of debt and limited access to credit, disproportionate exposure to hazardous work and environments, and lower levels of education.
