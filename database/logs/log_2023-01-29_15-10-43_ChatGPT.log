In this conversation, James asked about the country with the fastest growing emissions (India), reasons why India would be a good choice for a climate risk assessment (rapidly growing economy, vulnerability to natural disasters, dependence on agriculture and monsoon patterns, rapid urbanization and coastal development, large energy sector), whether India has more poor people than any other country (yes), how poverty is defined in that statistic (inability to meet basic needs for survival, measured by income or consumption levels), and reasons contributing to climate vulnerability among the poor in India (lack of access to resources and basic services, dependence on vulnerable natural resources, limited ability to adapt, high levels of debt, disproportionate exposure to hazardous work and environments, lower levels of education).
