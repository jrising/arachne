Delaware has 14 permitted artificial reef sites in Delaware Bay and along the Atlantic Coast, created using cleaned and stable construction materials, boats, and subway cars. These reefs provide new or enhanced hardbottom habitat, attracting sessile organisms and serving as a food source and refuge for juvenile marine life. They also support expanded recreational fishing and diving. The reef programs effectively manage and develop the sites, and actively communicate their locations to anglers to enhance fishing opportunities. The map in the report shows various datasets, including rock deployments, high points, reef guide locations, and other artificial reefs. The rock deployments and high points are primarily concentrated in Delaware Bay Sites 4, 6, and 7. The reef guide locations consist of concrete, rock, ballasted tires, marine cables, and salvaged vessels, which serve as artificial habitats. The data were obtained from state websites, NOAA, and internet research. Overall, these artificial reefs contribute to the conservation and diversification of marine ecosystems in Delaware waters.
