In a previous conversation, James asked how to convert the type of a tibble column from character to numeric. The assistant provided a solution using the `as.double()` function from the `tidyverse` package. James was shown an example using the `mutate()` function to convert a single column and achieve the desired result. The assistant also introduced the `mutate_at()` function as an option to convert multiple columns at once. Additionally, the assistant mentioned that the `as.double()` function returns `NA` for values that cannot be converted, and suggested using the `na.rm = TRUE` argument to remove `NA` values during conversion. Overall, the assistant provided a comprehensive answer to James' question.
