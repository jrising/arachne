James inquired about how to open multiple NetCDF files named in the pattern "daily_edds_YYYY.nc4". I provided a Python code snippet using the `glob` module and `xarray`'s `open_mfdataset()` to read and combine the files. He then asked if Dask was necessary for `open_mfdataset()`, and I clarified that it is recommended for large datasets but not required for smaller ones. Later, James reported an error indicating that Dask was missing. I advised him to install Dask using Conda or pip and suggested an alternative method using `xr.concat()` to combine files without Dask, ensuring he could still achieve his objective.
