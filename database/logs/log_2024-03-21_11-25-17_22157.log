James sought a user-friendly carbon footprint calculator for classroom use, desiring detailed calculations without complex inputs. Options like The Nature Conservancy's and the WWF's calculators offer simplicity but lack in-depth breakdowns, while tools like the Clean Air-Cool Planet and CoolClimate Network calculators provide more detailed insights but may require additional information. The suggestion to use a simpler calculator and discuss calculations separately or engage students in creating their own calculator aligns with James's educational goals of understanding carbon footprints effectively in a classroom setting.
