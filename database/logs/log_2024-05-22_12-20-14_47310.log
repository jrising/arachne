James set out to create a custom RSS aggregator incorporating material from email lists. Through a step-by-step guide, he learned to auto-forward emails, create a dedicated email account, access emails programmatically, parse emails into RSS items, generate and serve the RSS feed, and host it on a web server. The strategy focused on automation, error handling, regular updates, and monitoring for minimal maintenance. The plan suggested using existing tools alongside custom coding, emphasizing simplicity and efficiency in managing the aggregator for long-term sustainability.
