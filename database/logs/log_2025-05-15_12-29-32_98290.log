The conversation revolved around James Rising's response to Fattah Arif’s email concerning his rejected application (#899337128) to the University of Delaware for a program in Environmental Economics. Fattah expressed his passion for the field, specifically citing Dr. Rising’s work on larval dispersion of fishes and interests in neural networks, international trade, and climate change implications. He sought clarity on the reasons for his rejection and potential avenues for appeal or future application. In response, James drafted a professional email explaining that limited funding resulted in very few acceptances and noted that Fattah's GPA was below the admissions requirements. He encouraged further academic improvement and offered to discuss Fattah’s concerns via a scheduled Zoom meeting.
