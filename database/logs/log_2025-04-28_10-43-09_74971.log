James inquired about how to properly cite a press release from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). I provided guidance on including key citation elements such as the organization name, press release title, release date, and URL. I offered citation formats in both APA and MLA styles, giving specific examples for clarity. I encouraged him to adapt the templates according to the specific details of the press release, and invited further questions about particular citation styles or requirements.
