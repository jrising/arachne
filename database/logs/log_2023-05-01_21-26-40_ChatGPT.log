James asked how to transform a long-format dataframe into a wide-format one in R, with multiple counties and time periods. The AI suggested using the `spread()` function from the `tidyverse` package. The AI provided code examples for spreading a single value column and spreading multiple value columns using `gather()` and `unite()`. The AI explained that the `spread()` function would create a new dataframe with one row for each county and a separate column for each time period. James can use this approach to transform his dataframe into a desired wide format.
