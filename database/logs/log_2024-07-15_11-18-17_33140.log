James inquired about extracting the hour-of-day from a `DateTime` object in Julia. I provided a solution using the `Hour` function from the `Dates` module, demonstrating a sample code snippet. The example utilized a DateTime object and extracted the hour-of-day successfully, displaying the result as output. I offered further assistance if required.
