James inquired about converting a NetCDF file containing hourly data into daily averages while retaining the time variable "valid_time" in the same units (seconds since 1970). I provided a step-by-step guide using Python's xarray library, detailing necessary package installations and a script. The process included loading the NetCDF file, converting "valid_time" to datetime format, resampling the data to calculate daily averages, reconverting the time back to seconds since 1970, and saving the results to a new NetCDF file. The completed script emphasized file handling and time conversions, ensuring clarity for James to adapt it to his specific dataset.
