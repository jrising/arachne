James asked how to manage paragraph spacing in Google Docs, as the tool was keeping his paragraphs together, affecting his ability to meet a page limit. I provided several solutions: checking paragraph settings for spacing options, removing controls that prevent paragraphs from breaking (like widow/orphan control), adjusting margins for more space, and manually inserting page breaks where needed. I advised that a combination of these adjustments should help him better distribute paragraphs across pages, inviting him to reach out for further assistance if needed.
