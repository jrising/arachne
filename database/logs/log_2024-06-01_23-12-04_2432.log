James inquired about ensuring code runs at the end of a function with yields in Python to avoid leaving files open. I explained how to use the `finally` clause in a generator function to close files reliably, even if the generator is not fully consumed. I provided a code example demonstrating the `try`...`finally` structure within the generator function to guarantee proper file closure, regardless of the generator's execution outcome.
