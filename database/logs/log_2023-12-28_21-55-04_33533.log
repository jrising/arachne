This study titled "Offshore Wind and North Atlantic Right Whales: Modeling an Uncertain Interaction" explores the potential impacts of the proposed Ocean Wind 1 offshore wind project off the coast of New Jersey on the North Atlantic right whale (NARW) population. The research utilizes an integrated model that considers factors such as noise pollution, vessel collisions, artificial reef benefits, and stakeholder support dynamics. The outcomes of the model suggest that while NARW populations may not face significant decline due to the wind project, stakeholder support is sensitive to whale mortalities associated with turbine construction. The simulations predict that only 36 out of the planned 98 turbines would be constructed due to stakeholder opposition following 1.6 NARW deaths. Sensitivity analyses reinforce the importance of stakeholder perception in determining the scale of the project. The study stresses the need for careful consideration of both marine conservation and stakeholder concerns in executing offshore wind projects.
