James experienced an issue with predicting using a model due to the error message indicating that the factor `ISO` had new levels. The conversation focused on resolving this by checking and aligning factor levels between the model and new data. I suggested examining the existing levels of `ISO` in the model, adjusting the levels in `newdata`, and ensuring that no unintended dropped levels were causing the issue. Additionally, I provided a method to filter the results based on specified conditions involving `Scenario` and `ISO`, ensuring that the filtering occurred after adjusting the factor levels. Finally, I reinforced the importance of handling factor levels correctly to avoid prediction errors.
