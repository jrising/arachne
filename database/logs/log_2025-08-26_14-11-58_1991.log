James inquired about the possibility of reproducing a figure from a report in the supplementary information of his paper. I detailed key considerations including: obtaining copyright permission from the holder, ensuring proper citation and attribution, checking journal publisher policies regarding previously published materials, and the use of public domain or open access content. I also emphasized the importance of accurately describing any modifications to the figure and noted that while supplementary information may allow for more flexibility, the mentioned points still apply.
