James Rising inquired about his ancestor's voyage on the ship Dorset to Bermuda in 1635, wondering about the ship's type. The AI explained that ships during that period were typically small and suggested that the Dorset could have been a caravel, fluyt, or barque. Given the context of transporting indentured servants, it was likely a merchant vessel like a fluyt. When asked about the number of masts a fluyt would have had, the AI clarified that a typical fluyt had two masts, with a square sail on the main mast and a triangular sail on the foremast, highlighting the vessel's efficiency for trade.
