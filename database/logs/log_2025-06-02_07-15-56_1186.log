James inquired about building a web page to respond to forward and backward audio controls in his car. I confirmed that this is possible but requires compatibility with the car's infotainment system, which may support custom apps. I outlined steps including checking compatibility, using an audio control interface, web app development, integration, testing, deployment, and compliance. James then asked about standard methods potentially applicable through MDN rather than custom apps. I highlighted the Media Session API as a relevant standard for controlling media playback via web technologies, providing a code snippet for event listeners to respond to audio control events. I advised ensuring compatibility with the car's system for the Media Session API while offering further assistance if needed.
