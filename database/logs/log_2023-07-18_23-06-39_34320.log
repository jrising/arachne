In a previous conversation, James asked where to locate a JavaScript file stored in the static directory of a Flask app when including it in an HTML template file. I explained that the appropriate method is to use the `url_for()` function to generate the URL for the JavaScript file. By passing `'static'` as the first argument and `'filename=main.js'` as a keyword argument to `url_for()`, Flask will generate the correct path to the `main.js` file in the `static` directory. This method ensures that the links in the HTML template will always be correct, even if the actual location of the static files changes in future deployments.
