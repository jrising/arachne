The Building Innovation Hub is launching an initiative to engage and educate tenants in Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator (AHRA) buildings about energy efficiency and electrification. This project employs a dynamic mix of in-person gatherings and virtual dialogues to empower residents with knowledge of how changes in their homes benefit them and promote sustainability. The Hub aims to equip tenants with practical skills for operating new energy-efficient equipment while fostering open dialogue for feedback, informing continued improvements in energy programs. Framed as a pilot initiative, the project seeks to gather insights that will enable future scalability, cultivating a culture of energy consciousness and collective responsibility in the community. Ultimately, the Building Innovation Hub aspires to create a resilient, environmentally conscious future that can be passed down to future generations.
