In a conversation, James asked about who cut down a great cypress tree guarded by a giant. The assistant responded by introducing the mythological figure Orion and his pursuit of the Pleiades. The assistant explained that while Orion was often depicted with a club or a lion's pelt, there is less definitive information about his connection with a cypress tree in traditional Greek mythology. The assistant suggested that the connection might be part of an interpretation or particular retelling of the myth. The assistant asked James for more details or context to provide a more precise answer.
