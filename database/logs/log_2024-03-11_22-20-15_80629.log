James assigned a reading on climate ethics from Tol's textbook regarding the social cost of carbon. The AI provided multiple-choice questions to assess student comprehension, covering topics like the definition of the social cost of carbon, its relation to optimal emissions trajectory and discount rates, factors influencing its estimation, and the significance of the pure rate of time preference on climate policy. The questions aimed to evaluate understanding of key concepts related to the social cost of carbon and its implications for climate change mitigation policies.
