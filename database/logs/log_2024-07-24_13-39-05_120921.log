The discussion focused on identifying projects and actions necessary for securing bridge funding and advancing sustainability initiatives across five Midwest states (Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio). Key actions include organizing weekly coordination calls, allocating team time for support needs, notifying cities of funding opportunities, and facilitating in-person gatherings. Proposed projects involve GGRF Training plans, collaboration on grants, and advancing energy codes. The need for federal funding navigation, legislative support, and comprehensive outreach for funding rounds was also emphasized. This list aims to streamline efforts in accessing funding and enhancing project collaboration in the target regions.
