In a previous conversation, James inquired about a Native American phrase similar to "Mitakuye Oyasin" that is easier to say. The assistant explained the concept of "Mitakuye Oyasin" and suggested "Nia:wen" from the Mohawk language as a comparable phrase expressing gratitude. They emphasized the importance of understanding the cultural context and avoiding appropriation. James then asked about a Lenape phrase signifying interconnectedness. The assistant offered "Nëla nikële," meaning "I love you all," as a phrase that conveys unity. They highlighted the need for respect when using indigenous languages and acknowledged the limitations of their training.
