In a previous conversation, James asked how to add a header to a LaTeX document with the text "Research and Teaching Statement - James Rising" centered at the top of each page. Arachne provided a solution using the `fancyhdr` package and explained how to define and customize the header. However, James encountered an issue where the header did not show up on the first page. Arachne suggested adding the `\thispagestyle{fancy}` command right after `\begin{document}` to override the default page style and ensure the header appears on the first page.
