James sought assistance in revising a grant proposal paragraph to clarify the roles of NASRDA and IMR while minimizing repetition of IMR researchers' names. With input from a co-PI, the paragraph was split to highlight NASRDA's focus on WP1 and IMR's involvement in WP3, with IMR researchers mentioned once for efficiency and clarity. The revised paragraphs now clearly distinguish the roles of NASRDA and IMR in the grant proposal, enhancing readability and coherence.
