The section of the report focuses on two resources or activities: waste dump sites and submarine cables. The waste dump sites include three discontinued dump sites and a potential residual mine dump area. Special precautions need to be taken in these areas due to health and safety concerns. The submarine cables consist of undersea cables and pipelines used for telecommunication, oil, and gas. Some cables are operational, while others are non-operational. There is a need to identify and accurately chart all submerged cables, including privately and government-owned ones, for future development and research.
