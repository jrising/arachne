The provided document discusses two key resources or activities for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware. The first resource is waste dump sites, including former locations for municipal sewage sludge, acid waste, explosives, and a potential residual mine dump area. These sites are discontinued but may still pose challenges for development activities. Stakeholders include developers, resource managers, and potentially nearby communities. The second resource is submarine cables, including telecommunication cables and oil and gas pipelines, some of which are operational and others non-operational. The majority of hazardous cables are in the eastern section of the study area. Identification and charting of submerged cables, particularly privately and government-owned ones, are important for future research and development. Stakeholders include telecommunication companies, oil and gas companies, developers, and government entities.
