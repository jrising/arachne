Process-based Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), like IMAGE, consider negative-cost mitigation options even when a carbon price is set to zero, as these models aim to explore the full range of possible options and their impacts. However, the actual implementation of these measures in the real world can be influenced by market barriers, policies, norms, and other factors. IAMs simulate a range of scenarios and uncertainties, rather than providing a deterministic view of the future. Therefore, while IAMs can provide valuable insights, their results should be interpreted with caution and used as a basis for informed decision-making. The effectiveness of mitigation options in the real world is subject to various contextual and institutional factors beyond the scope of the models.
