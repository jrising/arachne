In a previous conversation, James sought clarification on the differences between the titles "Dr.," "Prof.," and "Dr. Prof." for his job application at ETH Zurich. Arachne explained that "Dr." is used for individuals who have completed a Doctorate degree, "Prof." is for those who have a teaching role at a university, and "Dr. Prof." combines both titles. James further asked if any of these titles imply tenure, and Arachne confirmed that the title "Prof." typically signifies having secured a tenured position, which provides job security and academic freedom. However, practices regarding tenure can vary, and it is important to review specific requirements and expectations of the institution being applied to.
