The conversation revolves around Arqam Tariq's request to transfer to the Environmental Economics program. Carlos Moffat responds, stating that although James Rising is open to advising Arqam, funding constraints prevent support for the transfer. Arqam proposes a plan to apply for provisional admission while seeking funding from his current department. He expresses willingness to explore assistantship opportunities during his tenure. In turn, James Rising drafts a professional response highlighting the impossibility of guaranteeing funding for self-pay students and emphasizing the advantages of securing funding through Arqam's existing program before considering a transfer. The email suggests a Zoom chat for further discussion, linking to a scheduling tool.
