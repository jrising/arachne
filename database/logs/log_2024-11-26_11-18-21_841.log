This conversation focused on developing a comprehensive funding strategy for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). Key points included identifying current donors, motivations for giving, and exploring new strategies to engage potential supporters. IMT aims to cultivate new donors through digital engagement, networking events, and partnerships with organizations aligned with its mission. Additionally, there was discussion about collaborative efforts with Future Wave Fundraising to identify funders in the DC region, address funding for Black and Brown CDFIs, and ensure compliance with regulations like the Davis-Bacon Act. The financial goal is to raise $1.3 million over two years for pilot programs. The next steps include refining strategies and establishing clear roles among stakeholders to maximize impact.
