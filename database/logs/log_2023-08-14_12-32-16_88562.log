The conversation was about James filling out a section of a grant proposal for the "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)" project. The focus was on the Community Benefits Plan (CBP) and the tasks involved in its implementation, such as establishing governance and procedures, community identification and engagement, formulating a community advisory board, workforce development and training programs, environmental impact studies and mitigation planning, educational outreach, securing and enhancing the American offshore wind supply chain, and performance evaluation and continuous improvement.
