The conversation focused on James' filling out of a section of the "Statement of Project Objectives" (SOPO) document for a grant proposal to the DOE. The project, named EMPOWER, aims to enable multi-disciplinary pathways in offshore wind education and research while prioritizing community benefits. The discussion outlined the key elements of the EMPOWER Community Benefits Plan (CBP) and its focus on three main objectives: creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, addressing energy equity, and investing in America's workforce.

The conversation further delved into the specific tasks and milestones of the project. These tasks include establishing governance and procedures for the CBP, identifying and engaging with communities, formulating a community advisory board, implementing workforce development and training programs, conducting environmental impact studies, facilitating educational outreach, enhancing the American offshore wind supply chain, and conducting performance evaluation and continuous improvement.

The conversation concluded by highlighting the key go/no-go decision points for each budget period and the desired end goals of the EMPOWER initiative, which include establishing a robust CBP, supporting disenfranchised communities in the Mid-Atlantic region, and measuring success through qualitative and quantitative engagement metrics.
