James inquired whether GDP numbers come from the international System of National Accounts. I confirmed that they do, explaining that the SNA is a globally recognized framework that offers systematic guidelines for measuring economic activity. I highlighted that GDP represents the total market value of all goods and services produced in a country over a certain time period. I also invited James to ask further questions about GDP calculation or its components.
