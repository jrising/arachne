Xiamen University in China uses a system for assigning majors based on students' preferences and a reassessment of major availability. If a student's preferred major is full or their test scores are not sufficient, they may be assigned to a different major, leading to a perception of random assignment. However, this allocation is a result of system-driven factors such as applicant preference, test scores, and major availability.
