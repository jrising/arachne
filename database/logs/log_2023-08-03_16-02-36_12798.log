In the discussion, James asked about the mechanism of allocating majors in Xiamen University, as claimed in a paper he was reviewing. The assistant explained that the allocation process in Chinese universities, including Xiamen University, is not exactly random in the Western sense. Instead, it is based on multiple factors, including students' preference, Gaokao test scores, and the availability of majors. High-scoring students have more freedom to choose competitive majors, while lower-scoring students may be assigned to under-subscribed programs. The paper's claim of students being "randomly adjusted" refers to the university's need to maintain curriculum balance and allocate students to majors when their preferred choices are full. The assistant advised further research on Xiamen University's specific system or a clarification request to the authors for more details.
