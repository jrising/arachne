The AI assistant recognized Lingze's potential fit for the program, especially given their non-traditional background and lighter quantitative experience. The assistant advised Lingze to mention their research interests and programming skills in their statement of purpose, particularly aligning with James's climate change risks and food systems modeling projects. However, the assistant cautioned Lingze about limited funding availability and encouraged them to apply before the end of the year for consideration. The response was drafted in a brief and professional manner, urging Lingze to highlight their qualifications while respecting the constraints of funding opportunities.
