James asked about the term for the ratio of the standard deviation over the mean. I responded that this ratio is known as the "coefficient of variation" (CV), which serves as a standardized measure of dispersion. I highlighted its utility in comparing relative variability across datasets with different units or mean values, and mentioned that it is usually expressed as a percentage.
