James requested a set of 15 distinguishable colors. I provided him with a palette of colors, including Bright Red (#FF0000), Lime Green (#00FF00), Blue (#0000FF), Yellow (#FFFF00), and others, ensuring they are distinct for various applications. I cautioned that color perception varies by display and individual eyesight, especially for those with color blindness, suggesting he use color blindness filters or patterns for accessibility.
