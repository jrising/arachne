James requested guidance on merging changes from the `ccac` branch in an old GitHub repository (`MimiPAGE2020.jl`) into a new repository (`MimiPAGE2025.jl`). I provided detailed command line instructions, including adding the old repository as a remote, fetching branches, checking out the relevant branch, merging changes, resolving conflicts, committing, and pushing updates. Additionally, he inquired about the necessity of `.gitignore` files in subdirectories. I explained that a base `.gitignore` may suffice, but subdirectory files can be useful for specific ignore rules or clarity when dealing with diverse project files.
