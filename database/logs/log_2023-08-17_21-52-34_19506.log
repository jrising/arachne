In this conversation, James asked how to add a layer to a group in QGIS. Arachne provided a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this, including creating a new group or selecting an existing group and dragging the layer into the group or using the "Move to group" option. Arachne also mentioned the flexibility to rearrange layers and groups using the cursor arrow.
