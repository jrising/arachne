James inquired about calculating GDP from an aggregated MRIO matrix, then sought to understand the impacts of a GDP shock on all countries using multipliers. He later asked about obtaining MRIO multipliers from IO matrices and inquired if the total output multiplier matrix reflects impacts on value added or final demand. The assistant provided detailed instructions on calculating GDP and employing multipliers in the MRIO framework. James later asked for derivations of the value-added and final demand multiplier matrices, which the assistant explained step by step within an IO framework, offering guidance on understanding the impacts of changes in value added and final demand.
