James inquired about low-calorie food options to pair with red wine while avoiding hangovers. I recommended grilled chicken, steamed vegetables, fish, salads, and mushroom-based dishes, alongside tips for hydration, eating while drinking, choosing quality wines, and moderating intake. He then asked for low-calorie snack ideas involving crackers and cheese. I suggested whole grain crackers with lighter cheeses (like reduced-fat cheddar), fresh vegetables for crunch, low-fat cottage cheese, and advised portion control to keep calories in check. The discussions centered on achieving enjoyable food pairings and snacks that promote health and moderation.
