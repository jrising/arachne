The conversation discussed the potential environmental impacts of offshore wind projects and the monitoring of marine mammal movements, specifically focusing on the North Atlantic right whale. The report section provided information on the impacts of construction and operation of offshore wind turbines on wildlife, including avian mortality, habitat displacement, acoustic disturbances, and disruption of migratory routes. Mitigation strategies, such as considering the temporal and spatial habitat use by marine mammals when siting turbines, were also mentioned. The conversation highlighted the importance of gathering data on marine mammal movements and habitat preferences to minimize conflict with offshore wind projects. The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (NARWC) database and sighting data were referenced as sources for monitoring right whale movements. The stakeholders involved in these activities included developers, regulatory agencies, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and the larger ecosystem. It was emphasized that the Marine Spatial Planning process for Delaware's Ocean & Bay Plan should take into account other marine species, avian species, aquatic environments, and human uses of these areas, along with considerations such as public consultation sessions, regulatory oversight, ecosystem-based management, climate change, economic valuation, and spatial compatibility analyses.
