In a previous conversation, James asked about how to confirm if FFmpeg is installed on his Ubuntu server. Arachne provided instructions on how to check the installation location of FFmpeg using the "which" or "whereis" commands. Arachne also mentioned that the typical installation path for FFmpeg is `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`. If the commands do not return any output, it indicates that FFmpeg is not installed. Arachne also suggested using the `find` command to search the entire system for any file named "ffmpeg" in case the binary was installed in a different location.
