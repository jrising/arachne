During the conversation, it was clarified that the protagonist's sisters in the original story of "The Little Mermaid" by Hans Christian Andersen do not have names. However, in the Disney animated film adaptation, Ariel is shown to have six older sisters named Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista, and Andrina. The names are fictional and were likely chosen for their sound and to fit with the other names in the film.
