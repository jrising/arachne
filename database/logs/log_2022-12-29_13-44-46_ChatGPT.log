In a discussion about the names of the Little Mermaid's sisters, it was noted that in the original story by Hans Christian Andersen, the sisters are unnamed. However, in the Disney animated film "The Little Mermaid," Ariel has six sisters named Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista, and Andrina. When asked about the meanings of the names, it was clarified that they do not have any particular meaning in any language and were likely chosen for their sound and compatibility with the other names in the film.
