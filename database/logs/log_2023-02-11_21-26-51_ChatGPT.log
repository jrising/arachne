In a previous conversation, James asked about episodes of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" that feature the Philadelphia Eagles. I provided a list of notable episodes, including "The Gang Gets Invincible," where the gang tries out for the Eagles, "The Nightman Cometh," where they put on a musical about the Eagles, "The Gang Wins the Big Game," where they compete in a touch football game on the day of the Eagles' big game, and "The Gang Goes on Family Fight," where they compete for Eagles season tickets on a game show. I also mentioned that there are likely more subtle references to the Eagles throughout the show's 14 seasons.
