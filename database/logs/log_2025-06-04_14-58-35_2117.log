James inquired about taking random draws from a linear regression model in R. He typically uses coefficients and a covariance matrix for this purpose. I provided an elegant approach utilizing the `MASS` package to sample from a multivariate normal distribution and explained how to make predictions using a custom function `random_draw_from_lm`. He then requested an adjustment to allow multiple draws but with the same input dataset. I adapted the function to accept a parameter `N` for the number of random draws, resulting in a predictions matrix where each row corresponds to a different draw.
