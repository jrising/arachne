In this conversation, James asked if it was possible to control the drawing order of features in QGIS based on their attribute values. The assistant provided a detailed solution for achieving this in QGIS. The steps involved opening the layer properties, enabling the rendering order functionality, defining the attribute to be used for rendering order, and selecting the desired sort order. The assistant also mentioned that if the year values were represented as text strings, they would need to be converted into numbers using an expression. Overall, the discussion provided James with a clear and actionable solution for controlling feature rendering order in QGIS based on attribute values.
