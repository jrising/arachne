James is preparing for a class on Climate Change Economics, focusing on Scott Barrett's 1994 paper on self-enforcing International Environmental Agreements (IEAs). I provided multiple-choice questions related to the main challenges, game theory concepts, mechanisms for sustaining IEAs, limitations, conditions for sustainability, critical assumptions, and areas for further research mentioned in the text. James asked for questions specifically related to the section on repeated games, and I tailored additional questions covering challenges, the role of discount rates, renegotiation-proof strategies, the impact of renegotiation, and factors influencing the number of countries sustaining cooperative outcomes. These questions aim to test students' comprehension of the implications and dynamics of repeated games within international environmental agreements, as discussed in Barrett 1994.
