James Rising received a graduate student inquiry from MD Zobayer Rahman, expressing interest in marine resources management at the University of Delaware for Fall 2025. In subsequent emails, Zobayer showcased his strong academic background and requested information about lab projects and the application process. James responded by suggesting Zobayer apply to the new Environmental Science & Management program by December 15 for funding consideration and invited him to a virtual open house. Despite Zobayer's enthusiastic follow-ups and completed application, James eventually informed him of a lack of funding for the current year, expressing regret but encouraging future contact. Zobayer then inquired about potential opportunities for Spring 2026, seeking guidance on how to proceed. James's final response communicated uncertainty about future funding availability while offering a chance to discuss further via Zoom.
