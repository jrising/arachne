With over 20 years in sustainability and philanthropy, I have led teams in mission-driven organizations to build strong communities. My focus has been on creating effective philanthropic strategies and meaningful partnerships. I have helped wealthy individuals and foundations achieve their philanthropic goals through thoughtful program design and coordination of large initiatives that engage diverse stakeholders. At the Institute for Market Transformation, I built a wide network of donors from philanthropy and business, enhancing investments in climate resilience. I also expanded partnerships with over 450 corporate participants at the Clean Energy Buyers Association, developing strategies that prioritize transparency and impact. With a master's in climate science from Columbia University, I excel at translating complex research into engaging narratives for stakeholders and am dedicated to including new voices as a board member of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
