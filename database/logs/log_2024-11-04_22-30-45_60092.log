In a conversation about responding to an email from Yuhui Zhai, a prospective Ph.D. student interested in carbon emissions and environmental policy, James Rising sought guidance on how to encourage the applicant while addressing their questions. The discussion emphasized transitioning from a Masters in Marine Policy to the new Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track, highlighting various relevant programs, including the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics and funding details. A form was recommended to help applicants identify the best program fit. The draft response thanked Yuhui for their inquiry, encouraged them to fill out the form, and suggested mentioning James in their application statement. The response was crafted to maintain a professional tone while outlining opportunities and expectations clearly.
