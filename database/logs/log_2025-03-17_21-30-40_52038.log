In the discussion, James shared content from a PDF regarding the AdapTDR database that captures the returns on adaptation investments, detailing net present values, internal rates of return, and benefit-cost ratios. The database categorizes benefits into three dividends: avoided losses, induced economic and development benefits, and additional environmental and social benefits. A standardized methodology was developed to estimate the present values of benefits not previously monetized. Notably, the terms "monetized," "quantified," and "valued" are defined interchangeably, and the challenges in valuing certain benefits were addressed. The conversation concluded with a detailed description of the benefits associated with each of the triple dividends, emphasizing their multifaceted impacts on climate and environmental interventions.
