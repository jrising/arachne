In the discussion, James sought assistance for modifying his PHP web application. Initially, he wanted to add a "parent_id" column to his `post_statement.php` script for inserting new statements while handling the possibility of NULL values. I provided an updated PHP script to appropriately manage this by conditionally preparing SQL queries based on whether `parent_id` was provided. Subsequently, James faced a 500 error when running the script and I outlined steps to debug the issue, including enabling error reporting and checking various log files. Finally, James requested guidance for handling `parent_id` in his `get_statements.php` script. I advised him on how to display information regarding `parent_id`, checking for NULL values and enhancing the user interface by adding informative messages.
