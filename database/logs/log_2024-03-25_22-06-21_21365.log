In the discussion, we explored the distinctions between open and closed Leontief input-output models. The open model represents inter-sectoral dependencies without explicit inclusion of value-added processes, while the closed model incorporates value-added components like wages and profits. The closed model is deemed more comprehensive due to its inclusion of endogenous factors, providing a deeper understanding of economic activities and relationships. While both models serve distinct analytical purposes, the closed model offers a higher level of completeness and internal consistency, making it a preferred framework for economic analysis and policy evaluation.
