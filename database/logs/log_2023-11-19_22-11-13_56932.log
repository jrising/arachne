James asked how to extract the coordinates from a `shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon` object in Python. The AI assistant provided a solution by accessing the `exterior` property of the polygon object, and then calling the `coords` method on it. The coordinates were extracted as a `CoordinateSequence` and converted into a list. The AI assistant also mentioned that if the polygon had interior rings (holes), their coordinates could be obtained by iterating through `polygon.interiors` and calling `coords` on each. Example code was provided to demonstrate the process.
