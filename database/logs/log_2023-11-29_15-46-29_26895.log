James asked whether vegetable broth that is just over a year past its "best if used by" date is still safe to consume. Arachne explained that as long as the broth was properly stored and the package is in good condition, it is likely safe to consume. The "best if used by" date refers to the product's quality, not safety. Arachne advised James to check for visible signs of spoilage, listen for a "pop" sound when opening a can, and ensure the broth smells normal. If the broth passes these tests, it should be fine to use. Arachne also emphasized that food waste can be reduced by recognizing that "best by" dates may lead to premature disposal of food.
