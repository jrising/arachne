In a previous conversation, James asked for the typical rate of flow into a bathtub. Arachne responded that a typical bathtub faucet pours water at a rate of approximately 15-18 liters (or approximately 4-5 gallons) per minute. This flow rate can vary depending on the water pressure in the home and the type of faucet. Arachne also advised James to measure the flow rate of his specific bathtub faucet if a more precise measurement is needed for a specific situation.
