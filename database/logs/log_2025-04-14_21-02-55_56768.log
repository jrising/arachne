James sought guidance on rendering sheet music for piano in JavaScript, emphasizing the need for well-known notation to minimize the learning curve for users. I recommended the **VexFlow** library, highlighting its compatibility with established formats such as **MusicXML** and **ABC notation**. VexFlowâ€™s ease of use, flexibility, and growing community support were noted as key advantages. I also suggested exploring its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) and [official documentation](https://www.vexflow.com/) for further development insights. Additionally, I mentioned **abcjs**, a library specifically for rendering ABC notation, as an alternative option.
