James Rising engaged in a multi-message exchange with Rupsha Dey, a Research Associate with a strong background in Environmental Economics and Climate Policy. Rupsha expressed her interest in joining James's research team, detailing her significant experience with climate-related economic issues in India, particularly her contributions to the RBI's Annual Flagship Policy Report. James acknowledged her qualifications and suggested that she fill out a prospective student form for the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics. Rupsha completed the form and applied by the December 1 deadline. After submitting her application, she checked in with James regarding the admissions timeline. In the end, James informed Rupsha, with regret, that due to limited funding, her application was not selected.
