James requested assistance in creating a preamble for a letter to the Coalition of Ministries of Finance, which relates to a project on understanding the benefits of climate adaptation. He provided a previous letter as a reference and wanted something brief that acknowledged their past involvement without closely mirroring the earlier text. In response, I crafted an introductory section that expressed gratitude for their contributions, framed the new focus on adaptation opportunities, and emphasized the importance of their insights for the flagship Coalition report.
