In a previous conversation, James asked about determining the stability and behavior of cycles in 2-D sets of differential equations. Arachne provided a step-by-step approach to determine stability using the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. If both eigenvalues have negative real parts, the cycle is stable and spirals inward. If both eigenvalues have positive real parts, the cycle is unstable and spirals outward. If the eigenvalues have nonzero imaginary parts, the behavior depends on the sign of the real parts. Arachne also mentioned that Lyapunov exponents can provide additional insights. Negative Lyapunov exponents indicate stability, while positive exponents indicate instability and potential chaotic behavior. Calculating Lyapunov exponents typically requires numerical methods and can be more computationally intensive.
