In a discussion centered on addressing data gaps in marine spatial planning (MSP), James sought to highlight how findings from Delaware exemplify global MSP challenges. I emphasized that disparities in data quality and availability hinder effective planning, advocating for improved data integration across ecological, economic, and social dimensions. Additionally, we explored the broader impacts of closing data gaps on policy, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement to mitigate conflicts and incorporate diverse perspectives. This approach enhances the relevance and agility of MSP. Ultimately, we stressed that healthier marine ecosystems, supported by comprehensive data, lead to vital ecosystem services for human well-being, ensuring sustainable use and conservation of marine resources.
