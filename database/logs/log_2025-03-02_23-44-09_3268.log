The discussion included an assessment of an ongoing grant project, focusing on objectives and work plans as per the DoA. Key points included progress toward specific objectives (O1-O5), highlighting the need for improved stakeholder co-creation and integration of modeling. Critical evaluations of work packages disclosed gaps in stakeholder input and methodological concerns, particularly within deliverables D2.2, D2.3, and D5.2. The project's overall relevance in addressing EU adaptation issues was affirmed, emphasizing its alignment with the European Green Deal. However, challenges in stakeholder engagement and timely data release were identified as areas requiring attention. Open science practices were noted as integral, yet dependent on publication timelines. The project's management has been deemed effective, maintaining resource allocation consistency. Overall, while the project demonstrates promise, it necessitates enhanced stakeholder interaction and clearer pathways for policy impact.
