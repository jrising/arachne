James sought help on replacing missing values in a Julia DataFrame with the minimum of each column. I provided a detailed guide utilizing the `DataFrames.jl` package: loading the package, creating a DataFrame with missing values, defining a function to fill missing values with column minimums, and applying this function to the DataFrame. A sample DataFrame was used to demonstrate the process, resulting in the replacement of missing values with their respective column minimums. The final DataFrame output showed the successful replacement, providing James with a practical solution for handling missing values in his data analysis tasks.
