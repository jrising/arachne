James requested a synthesis of board member roles and responsibilities to create a list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The discussion outlined each board member's specific focus areas, including strategic alignment, committee roles, and programmatic deployments. Key takeaways included Sandra’s focus on board cohesion and management communication, Eric’s emphasis on strategy and community engagement, Bomee's financial oversight, and other members’ commitments to climate action, inclusive real estate, and network building. The resultant KPIs aimed to measure each member's effectiveness in supporting IMT's mission, enhancing collaboration, and ensuring impactful program execution, allowing for performance evaluation based on their specific contributions.
