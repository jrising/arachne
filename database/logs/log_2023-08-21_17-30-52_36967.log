The Delaware marine waters contain a range of underwater infrastructures, including wastewater outfall pipes in the upper bay and along the coast, pipelines both offshore and near the shore with a 100-foot-wide right of way on each side, and submarine cables for telecommunications and power transmission. These cables are located in various areas, such as the upper bay and near the mouth. The availability and location of the outfall pipes and discharge points may vary due to data constraints.
