James inquired about what constitutes a conflict of interest when agreeing to be a reviewer on an ongoing grant project. I outlined several key scenarios that qualify as conflicts: financial interests tied to the project's outcome, personal or professional relationships with the project team, institutional affiliations that could impact objectivity, competing interests with other projects, or prior involvement in related phases. I emphasized the importance of transparency and urged disclosing any potential conflicts to the requesting party for their assessment.
