In the previous conversation, James asked about the mean of the exponential of a normally distributed random variable. The assistant provided the formula for the mean of the log-normal distribution, which is the exponential of the mean plus half the variance. For a normally distributed random variable `X` with a mean of `0` and a standard deviation of `σ`, the mean of `exp(X)` is `exp(σ²/2)`.
