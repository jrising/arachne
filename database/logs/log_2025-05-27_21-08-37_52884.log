James asked for the equivalent term to "Femme" for men who present in a masculine way. I responded that "Masc" or "Butch" are commonly used in LGBTQ+ communities to describe such masculine gender expressions. I emphasized that context and individual identity are important, as the most suitable term may differ based on personal preference and cultural background.
