James inquired about whether to refer to John Dee as "Dr. Dee" or "Professor Dee" in a 16th-century setting. I provided historical context, noting that while "Professor Dee" would not have been common, "Dr. Dee" aligns with his academic qualifications and honors. Recommending authenticity, I advised using "Dr. Dee" in his story for accuracy and credibility.
