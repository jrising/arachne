James reminisces about the concept of "open borders" in the U.S. and questions its historical implications on border control and treatment of undocumented migrants. Arachne explains that historically, the term "open borders" in the U.S. did not mean completely unrestricted immigration but rather minimal federal regulations before the late 19th century. She highlights the evolution of immigration restrictions and enforcement over time, mentioning significant laws like the Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Arachne suggests that the emphasis on "open borders" in James's childhood might have reflected values of international cooperation, welcoming refugees, and the U.S. as a nation of immigrants. The discussion underscores the complexities of U.S. immigration policy and the ongoing debates surrounding border control and undocumented migrants.
