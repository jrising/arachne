Producing comprehensive climate risk estimates for poor countries is challenging due to several factors. Firstly, poor countries often lack sufficient data on their current and potential future climate, hindering accurate modeling and prediction of climate change impacts. Secondly, limited resources and infrastructure in these countries increase their vulnerability to climate change, including sea level rise, extreme weather events, and shifts in precipitation patterns. Thirdly, weak governance and institutions impede effective planning and response to climate change in these nations. Lastly, the absence of reliable data on economic and social indicators in poor countries makes it difficult to estimate the economic and social ramifications of climate change.
