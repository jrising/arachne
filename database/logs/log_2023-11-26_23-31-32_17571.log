James has been asked to speak on a panel about the challenges of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and implicit goal setting in economic analyses in the context of the Ocean/Coast we want. He seeks guidance on what points to raise. The AI assistant suggests several issues to address, including value pluralism, quantification, distributive justice and power dynamics, time preference and deep uncertainty, value elicitation methods, and the role of CBA in the democratic process. These points tie in with the panel's focus on understanding how social goals are identified, negotiated, and change over time. James can use these insights to provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and limitations of CBA, highlighting the need for a more inclusive and multidimensional approach to goal setting in economic analyses.
