In a conversation regarding a potential role at "Reproductive Freedom for All," James inquired about reasons to pursue this opportunity. I outlined several compelling points: first, the alignment between the organization's mission and his interests in global sustainability and social justice; second, the interdisciplinary approach that parallels his own work; third, the tangible impact he could have on reproductive freedoms; fourth, the potential for skill development in relevant fields; and fifth, the inclusive culture typically found in such organizations. I encouraged further research and conversations with current staff to ensure alignment of values and beliefs.
