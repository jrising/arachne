James inquires about the availability of free data for constructing an Input-Output (I/O) model to research the effect of a transition to a hydrogen economy on different income groups. The assistant suggests several free sources of comprehensive economic data, such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis, EUROSTAT, OECD's STAN input-output databases, and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). While standard I/O models do not differentiate between income groups, the assistant recommends integrating I/O modeling with microsimulation or CGE models that incorporate household-level data to analyze distributional outcomes. The assistant also mentions the Consumer Expenditure Survey as a potential source for household income and expenditure data and suggests using GAMS for building CGE models. The assistant offers further guidance if needed.
