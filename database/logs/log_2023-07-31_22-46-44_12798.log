James inquired about researching the effects of transitioning to a hydrogen economy on households of different income groups. He was concerned about the cost of proprietary Input-Output (I/O) models and whether such models include distinct income groups. I suggested leveraging free data sources like the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), EUROSTAT, OECD's STAN input-output database, and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to construct his own I/O model. I also explained that standard I/O models do not generally differentiate between income groups, but he could integrate I/O modeling with microsimulation or Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models that incorporate household-level data. I mentioned the Consumer Expenditure Survey and GAMS as potential data sources and software for modeling. I offered assistance with training materials or expert advice if needed. James expressed satisfaction with the information provided.
