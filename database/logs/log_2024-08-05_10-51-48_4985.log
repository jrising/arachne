James sought advice on displaying a high-resolution raster atop a map in a Shiny app using Leaflet. The assistant recommended preprocessing the raster into tiles using `gdal2tiles.py`, hosting the tiles on a web server like `nginx`, and integrating them with Leaflet in the Shiny app. Detailed steps on tile generation, hosting, and Shiny app modification were provided to efficiently handle large data sizes and enhance performance, ensuring the effective display of high-resolution raster data in the Shiny app.
