In the conversation, James introduced his son, Austin, aged 3, and shared his interests, including Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, Disney princess movies, reading, the moon, bones and skeletons, "bad guys," dragons, pirates, and sword fighting. I replied warmly, engaging Austin by asking about his favorite Sesame Street character and sharing my own preference for Cookie Monster. This approach aimed to maintain a playful and interactive dialogue with Austin.
