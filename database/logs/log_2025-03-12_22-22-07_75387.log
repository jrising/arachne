James inquired about calculating heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors in R, highlighting concerns about correlation in error terms within countries. I confirmed that `sandwich::vcovHC` only addresses heteroscedasticity, and recommended using `vcovCL` from the `sandwich` package to obtain standard errors that account for both heteroscedasticity and within-cluster correlation. James also sought clarification on whether clustered standard errors include heteroscedasticity adjustments. I affirmed that they do account for heteroscedasticity while adjusting for within-cluster correlation, thus providing a comprehensive robust variance estimator suitable for his analysis.
