In a previous conversation, James Rising sought assistance in responding to an email from Chidinma Amanze, who expressed interest in research opportunities related to climate resilience within fisheries. Chidinma shared her academic background in Maritime Management Technology and her research on COVID-19's impact on the maritime industry, highlighting her quantitative skills. James decided to direct her to the newly transitioned Environmental Science & Management program, and suggested she fill out a form to help identify the appropriate program. He noted the Ph.D. program's limited funding, encouraging her to apply by December 1 if interested in quantitative research. A concise email response template was crafted to facilitate communication while maintaining a professional tone.
