James inquired about the use of Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) to address the issue of estimating multiple coefficients. The AI explained the purpose of SUR in dealing with correlated error terms across equations and distinguished it from the Multiple Comparisons Problem (MCP), which leads to false positives in hypothesis testing. Recommendations were given on correcting for the MCP using methods like Bonferroni correction and False Discovery Rate, suggesting these in addition to or instead of utilizing SUR for addressing chance significant results caused by multiple testing.
