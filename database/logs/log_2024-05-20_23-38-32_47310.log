The 1896 American election featured a vigorous debate between advocates of bimetallism, led by William Jennings Bryan, and supporters of the gold standard, including William McKinley. Key points included inflation concerns, debt relief, economic growth for bimetallism proponents, and stability, inflation prevention for gold standard supporters. Bryan's memorable "Cross of Gold" speech symbolized the bimetallism cause. This debate heightened public understanding of economic policy and monetary systems. Despite McKinley's victory and the maintenance of the gold standard, the election exemplified a robust policy discourse that engaged the populace and shaped future monetary practices towards fiat currency.
