James inquired about efficiently identifying non-zero columns of a specific row in a `dgCMatrix` without converting to dense format. I confirmed that it's possible to do this using the `summary()` function of the Matrix package in R. I provided a step-by-step method to extract non-zero column indices by creating a function that summarizes the sparse matrix. An example `dgCMatrix` was illustrated, along with the function `get_nonzero_columns()` to retrieve the desired indices directly, thus avoiding the generation of a dense vector. This approach follows Râ€™s 1-based indexing convention and offers an efficient solution tailored to James's needs.
