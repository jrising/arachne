In a previous conversation, James sought guidance on whether to include his grant-writing experience in his tenure packet. The assistant advised including this material in both the external and internal statements. For the external statements, James was encouraged to mention his participation in grant-writing groups and any successful proposals, highlighting the impact on research, teaching, and service. In the internal packet, James was advised to provide more details about the number of proposals, funding agencies targeted, and amount secured, along with any interdisciplinary collaborations or skills gained. Emphasizing collaborative experiences can present a cohesive narrative of James' contributions and potential for future success in his academic career.
