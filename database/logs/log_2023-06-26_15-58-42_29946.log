James is preparing his tenure packet and asks if he should include his grant-writing experience in both the external and internal statements. Arachne advises him to include this information in both statements, emphasizing the skills and collaborations gained from grant writing. For external statements, James can mention his participation in grant-writing groups and successful proposals. Internal statements should include details about the number of proposals, targeted agencies, funding secured, and interdisciplinary collaborations. Arachne reminds James to craft a cohesive narrative showcasing his impact as a scholar, teacher, and community member.
