James inquired about specific terms used to describe regions related to food depots, recalling that much of Manhattan was referred to as being in the same "basin." I clarified that he might be thinking of terms like "catchment area," "service area," "supply zone," or "distribution zone," which denote the regions served by food distribution centers. I explained that "service basin" could apply if the depot functions similarly to other utilities, and offered to assist further if he had additional context to refine the terminology.
