James is teaching a class on Climate Change Economics and assigned Chapter 17 of the Stern Review as reading material. Key topics include the fundamental policies for tackling climate change, barriers to action on energy efficiency, the role of regulation, overcoming capital constraints, misaligned incentives, and the importance of information policies. To evaluate students' understanding, a set of multiple-choice questions was provided based on the readings, covering topics such as policy responses, market imperfections, and driving forces for investments in energy-using technologies. These questions aim to assess comprehension of the key messages outlined in the Stern Review.
