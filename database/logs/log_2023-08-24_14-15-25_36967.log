In this discussion, James asked about the standard file ending for a pickle file, to which I responded that it is `.pkl`. James then inquired whether there is a `with` structure for pickled files. I explained that the `with` statement can indeed be used to open and handle pickled files in Python. I provided an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `with` statement with pickled files, showcasing the process of creating a pickled object, saving it to a file, and then loading it back from the file. I emphasized that the `with` statement ensures proper file closure, even in the event of an exception.
