In a previous conversation, James requested an "After Action Review" table to evaluate a project's success and areas for improvement. I provided a template with stages including Pre-Engagement, Engagement, Post-Engagement, and Follow-Up Actions, highlighting what went well and suggestions for improvement. James then inquired about funding sources for climate work in the Greater Los Angeles Area. I shared a list of organizations, including The JPB Foundation, The California Endowment, and The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, that support climate initiatives, emphasizing the need to research each funder's focus areas and application processes to identify the best match for his project.
