In this discussion, James sought a plain-language summary of a complex methodology that uses large language models (LLMs) for systematic literature reviews. The process involves filtering searches based on titles, abstracts, and keywords, employing both OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Gemini’s gemini-1.5-flash models as independent reviewers. To ensure accuracy, papers are only excluded if both models agree on criteria. The system automates PDF retrieval and evaluates each page for relevant content, extracting key quantitative data into a structured format. This methodology is adaptable, demonstrated by its application to 40,000 abstracts on climate change risks, identifying 2,000 potentially relevant papers for a study on macroeconomic risks and adaptation potential. Finally, a meta-analysis of the findings at a national level is presented.
