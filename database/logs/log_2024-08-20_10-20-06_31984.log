James inquired about indicating values in thousands of USD in table headers. The assistant suggested modifying the header to include "(in 1000s USD)" or "(K USD)" for clarity. James asked for a shorter option, leading to the suggestion of using "$'000s" in the column headers for compactness. The assistant confirmed that "$'000s" is a concise and clear notation, offering an example for implementation. This discussion aimed to enhance data presentation in tables for easier comprehension.
