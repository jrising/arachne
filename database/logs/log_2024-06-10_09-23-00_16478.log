The Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS) support the District's green initiatives outlined in the Clean Energy DC Plan, aiming for significant greenhouse gas reductions by 2032. Casinos are adopting BEPS to enhance energy efficiency, reduce operational costs, and attract eco-conscious customers, while also contributing to lower emissions and better public health. The District's strategies for achieving climate goals include promoting efficient building design, transitioning to renewable energy, and electrifying transportation. Since buildings contribute 71% of the District's emissions, improving energy use in this sector is essential for meeting climate commitments.
