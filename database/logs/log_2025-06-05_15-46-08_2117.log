James sought guidance on using `mutate()` and `across()` in `dplyr` to replace `NA` values with "0" across multiple columns in R. I explained that `mutate()` combined with `across()` can apply a function to selected columns, utilizing the `coalesce()` function for this purpose. I provided an example of a data frame and the implementation, highlighting the use of `where(is.numeric)` to select numeric columns and the functionality of `coalesce(., 0)` to perform the replacement. I emphasized ensuring the replaced value's type matched the column's data type, demonstrating the solution clearly and inviting further queries if needed.
