In a previous conversation, James asked about the minimum wind speed needed for a 19th-century 3-mast ship like the whaler Essex to travel. The assistant responded that the minimum wind speed would depend on factors such as the ship's design, load, and sea conditions. While historical records and experiences suggest that a typical large sailing ship could start making reasonable headway in winds of 3 to 5 knots, this can vary. The assistant also noted that wind speed is not the only factor affecting a ship's ability to make progress. The direction of the wind, sail configuration, ship balance, and crew skill are also important. Skilled sailors can maximize wind power and keep the ship moving in light winds, while an inexperienced crew may struggle.
