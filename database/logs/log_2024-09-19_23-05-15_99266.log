James inquired about marsh birds hunted in 17th century UK, leading to a discussion on birds like the Kingfisher, Snipe, and Teal. Further, he explored Puritan associations with hunting these birds, delving into their views on nature and hunting practices. In a later query, he sought information on Puritan priests' titles, clarifying that they did not use "father." Lastly, the focus shifted to other marsh animals intertwined with Puritan values, highlighting species like Frogs, Cranes, and Herons aligning with Puritan principles of humility and introspection, despite lacking direct associations with Puritanism.
