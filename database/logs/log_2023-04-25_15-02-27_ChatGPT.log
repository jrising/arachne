In this conversation, James asked for a reading recommendation that explores the challenges of freedom in academic research from an existential perspective. Arachne suggested two books: "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus and "The Denial of Death" by Ernest Becker. The first book discusses the concept of the absurd and finding purpose in seemingly futile tasks, which can be applied to the pursuit of knowledge in academic research. The second book explores how individuals invest time and effort in various pursuits, including research, to create meaning and a sense of importance in the face of mortality.
