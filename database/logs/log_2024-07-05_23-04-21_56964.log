James inquired about reading and extracting data from `.ini` files with mixed content using Python. Arachne recommended utilizing Python's `configparser` module to handle comments, sections, and key-value pairs. A script example was provided to demonstrate reading and outputting data from the `.ini` file accurately. Following up, James asked about extracting a specific key (`name`) from each section, to which Arachne explained how to modify the script to retrieve and display only the `name` values for each section effectively. This guidance enables James to programmatically access and utilize specific data from complex `.ini` files for his projects.
