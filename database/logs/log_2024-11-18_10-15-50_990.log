James sought strategies for engaging current members of the DC Building Innovations Hub Advisory Committee to encourage them to bring in new members. I recommended several steps, including facilitating engaging meetings, ensuring clear communication, recognizing member contributions, leveraging networking opportunities, implementing a buddy system, personalized outreach, and understanding what motivates prospective members.

Additionally, James requested the development of a stewardship calendar for touch points with board members and funders in 2025. I provided a structured calendar with specific touch points throughout the year, including thank you notes, appreciation events, mid-year progress updates, annual meetings, and ongoing regular check-ins, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong relationships and clear communication with stakeholders.
