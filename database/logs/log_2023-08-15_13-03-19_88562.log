The presented analysis assesses the impacts of climate change on various sectors, highlighting both current and potential future losses. The gravest losses are projected to reach 4.1% of GDP by the end of the century under current policies, with high mitigation efforts potentially reducing these impacts by 2.9 percentage points. Trade losses are also a significant concern, with estimates ranging from 0.5% to 3.2% of GDP by 2100 under current policies. However, a high mitigation pathway could reduce trade losses by 0.6 to 1.9 percentage points. The analysis emphasizes the urgent need for substantial mitigation efforts and notes the uncertainties associated with these estimates. It underscores that climate change-induced disruptions can have far-reaching consequences for global trade and highlights the potential benefits of proactive measures in mitigating these impacts.
