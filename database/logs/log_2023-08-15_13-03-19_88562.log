The discussion focused on the analysis of climate change impacts on various sectors, with an emphasis on damage estimates and trade losses. The analysis revealed that catastrophic damage risks could reach 4.1% GDP by the end of the century, but high mitigation efforts could attenuate these impacts by 2.9 percentage points. Likewise, prevention strategies offer potential for reducing losses from missing risks. Damage estimates for inland flooding, drought, and labor productivity loss were highlighted, with mitigation initiatives promising substantial reductions. Trade losses were also discussed, indicating the potential economic ramifications of climate change on global commerce. Under the current policy trajectory, trade losses are expected to range from 0.5% to 3.2% of GDP, but high mitigation efforts could reduce these losses by 0.6 to 1.9 percentage points.
