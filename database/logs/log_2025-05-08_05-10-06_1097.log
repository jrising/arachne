The conversation focused on developing a comprehensive 6-month fundraising strategy for The Forum Foundation. James requested a plan outlining SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals that align with the Foundation’s mission of inclusion, advancement, equity, and advocacy. Key elements included identifying the target audience, donor segmentation, and strategies for fundraising channels such as individual giving, grants, corporate sponsorships, and fundraising events. 

I responded with detailed fundraising goals aimed at raising $150,000, establishing new corporate partnerships, and increasing donor participation among members. The segmentation categorized potential donors and outlined tactics for engagement. Tactics included storytelling for individual giving, targeted grant proposals for equity-focused funding, and sponsorship packages highlighting corporate social responsibility. The strategy emphasized building community ties and fostering long-term relationships to support the Foundation’s mission.
