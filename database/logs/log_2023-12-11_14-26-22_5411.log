James wanted to construct a matrix in Julia from a CSV file containing parameters for each country and time period. Arachne provided a step-by-step guide, advising James to create an empty matrix using the `Matrix{T}` function, read the CSV file using `CSV.read()`, and add rows to the matrix by iterating over the time periods and countries and assigning calculated values to the appropriate row and column. Arachne emphasized the importance of replacing the file path, country list, and time periods list with actual data and noted that Julia is one-indexed.
