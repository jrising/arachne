James was trying to install Ubuntu alongside Windows but encountered issues with disabling BitLocker and Fast Startup. The assistant provided a step-by-step guide to disable BitLocker and recommended disabling Fast Startup through the Power Options. When James found that the option was disabled, the assistant suggested an alternative method using the Windows Registry Editor. The assistant guided James on how to navigate the Registry Editor to disable Fast Startup by creating/modifying the `HiberbootEnabled` value. James was advised to save any unsaved work and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
