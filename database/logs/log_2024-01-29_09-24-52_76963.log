The "Integrated Science Plan for Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic Waters," developed by the Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative for Offshore Wind (RWSC), provides recommendations and a framework for addressing data gaps in offshore activities, specifically in relation to wildlife and habitat considerations and sustainable energy infrastructure development. The plan emphasizes the need for effective data management, including leveraging existing infrastructure and coordinating data sharing. It also recommends consistent data collection and sharing practices among institutions involved in offshore wind projects. Tailored data collection for specific species and subregions, ongoing baseline data collection, and consistency in methodology and tools are highlighted. The plan calls for expanded wildlife surveys and sensor networks throughout the study area to detect changes in behavior, abundance, and health. The RWSC aims to inspire research objectives, funding decisions, and collaboration within the scientific community, as well as reassess the plan and collaboration framework regularly to address emerging data gaps and changes in the offshore wind industry.
