In a conversation with James, he inquired about the performance difference between a GPU and CPU in performing dot-products. I explained that the speed differential depends on the specific hardware and implementation details of the GPU and CPU in question. However, I mentioned that GPUs are generally optimized for parallel processing and excel at matrix operations like dot products. I highlighted that the performance gain can range from several times to hundreds of times faster for GPUs compared to CPUs.
