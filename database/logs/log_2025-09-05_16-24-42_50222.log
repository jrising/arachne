The discussion centered on why the Amazons fought Achilles in Greek mythology. James inquired about the conflict, and I explained that Penthesilea, the queen of the Amazons, aimed to join the Trojans in the Trojan War for glory and redemption after the accidental death of her sister, Hippolyta. The narrative highlights the Amazons as skilled warriors, with Achilles representing the Greek side as their greatest warrior. I noted the eventual duel between Achilles and Penthesilea, emphasizing Achilles' mixed feelings of admiration and remorse after defeating her. This exchange mirrored themes of honor, fate, and the complexities of war.
