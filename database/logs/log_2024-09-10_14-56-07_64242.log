James Rising received an email from a prospective student, Mahadi Amin, expressing interest in an M.Sc in Marine Science and Policy. James responded, suggesting the Environmental Science & Management program and advising on funding limitations. Mahadi then shared financial constraints and research interests. James recommended the funded Marine Biosciences program and offered to discuss further alignment. The final response from James encouraged Mahadi to consider the funded Marine Biosciences program and provided a link for more information, while welcoming a meeting to explore research alignment.
