James inquired about how the DIVA coastal dataset captures land value and details like infrastructure, building, and capital stock. I explained that DIVA provides generalized economic assessments rather than detailed localized data. Specifically, it estimates land value using aggregated economic data at regional or national levels, while the infrastructure and capital stock information is based on proxies like GDP and land use types, lacking disaggregation. For detailed assessments, I recommended integrating DIVA with more localized datasets or economic models. I emphasized that while DIVA is valuable for broad vulnerability assessments in coastal regions, it does not offer high-resolution data on infrastructure specifics.
