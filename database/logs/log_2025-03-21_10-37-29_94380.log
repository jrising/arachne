James inquired about the relationship between the UK's His Majesty's Treasury (HMT) and the Bank of England. In response, I explained that while HMT manages public finance and economic policy, the Bank of England functions as the central bank, overseeing monetary policy and financial stability. Key points include the Bank's independence in monetary policy, guided by inflation targets set by the Chancellor of HMT, and their collaboration during financial crises via the Financial Policy Committee. Additionally, HMT's Debt Management Office works with the Bank on government debt issuance. There are structured communications between the two entities to ensure cohesive economic strategy, highlighting the importance of the Bank's independence for maintaining credibility in monetary policy.
