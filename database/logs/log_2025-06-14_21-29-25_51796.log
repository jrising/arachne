James Rising received an inquiry from prospective graduate student Muallimul Islam, expressing interest in joining his research team focused on climate change and fisheries. After acknowledging Muallimul's impressive background, James clarified that the application deadline for graduate studentships for the current semester had closed and encouraged him to check the department's website for future opportunities. Muallimul then clarified his intent to apply for the following academic year and sought guidance on enhancing his application or remote engagement with James's lab. James confirmed he looked forward to receiving his application but noted that no RA or TA positions would be available in his lab due to funding challenges. James also offered Muallimul the option to discuss further via Zoom, providing a scheduling link.
