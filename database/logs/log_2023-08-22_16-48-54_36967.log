James was trying to convert 3-hourly netCDF data to daily data using xarray in Python. However, he encountered an issue when trying to write the resulting data back to a netCDF file. The problem was due to grouping the data by a date object, which is not supported by netCDF. The assistant provided a solution by rounding the time coordinate to daily resolution using the `resample` function in xarray. The assistant gave step-by-step instructions, including converting the time dimension to a `datetime64` object, resampling the data to daily frequency using the `mean()` function, and finally saving the resampled dataset to a new netCDF file. James was able to successfully resample his data and save it to a daily frequency netCDF file.
