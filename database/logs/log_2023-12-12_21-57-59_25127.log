In a previous conversation, James asked if there were nutrition determinants of tuberculosis, malaria, or fistula. I explained that nutrition plays a significant role in the outcomes of these diseases. Malnutrition increases susceptibility to tuberculosis, and deficiencies in vitamins and micronutrients can impair immune responses and disease progression. Malnourished individuals are more susceptible to severe malaria, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals are common in malaria patients. Although nutrition has a lesser direct role in fistula, maternal malnutrition can lead to a smaller pelvic size and obstructed childbirth, contributing to the risk of obstetric fistula. In general, good nutrition is crucial for a strong immune system and overall health and well-being.
