The conversation provided information on three activities with potentially conflicting interests in offshore wind development: recreational fishing, sand borrow locations, and artificial reefs. Recreational fishing activities take place in specific areas that could potentially conflict with wind turbine installations. Sand borrow locations involve ongoing dredging operations for beach erosion control, and some of these locations may overlap with proposed wind development areas. Artificial reefs, which act as habitats for fish and popular fishing spots, may create conflicts with wind turbine installations due to physical obstructions. The stakeholders involved in these activities include recreational fishers, offshore wind developers, resource managers, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and state-specific Departments of Fish & Wildlife. The sources of information include NOAA-NMFS, Captain Seagullâ€™s Fishing Maps, NOAA Nautical Charts, and the Delaware Geological Society. It is also noted that specific spatial extents are not provided in the report and would need to be identified on maps that were not provided.
