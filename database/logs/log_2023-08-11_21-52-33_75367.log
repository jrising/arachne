The discussion provided information about three different activities and their potential conflicts with offshore wind development. The activities include recreational fishing, sand borrow locations, and artificial reefs. It was mentioned that recreational fishing in specific areas could potentially conflict with wind turbine installations, but wind projects might also attract more fish and stimulate the fishing industry. Sand borrow locations used for beach erosion may conflict with wind development proposals. Existing artificial reefs may create conflicts due to physical obstructions. The stakeholders involved in these activities include fishers, offshore wind developers, resource managers, and geological surveys. The sources of information varied and included NOAA-NMFS, fishing maps, nautical charts, and state-specific departments of fish and wildlife.
