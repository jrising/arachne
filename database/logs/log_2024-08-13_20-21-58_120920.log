James sought advice on using rclone to sync directories between servers while excluding large folders that he couldn't copy. I recommended using the `--exclude` flag in the rclone command to filter out specific directories, providing examples of how to exclude a folder named `large_files` and additional directories if needed. I emphasized quoting patterns to avoid shell globbing issues and suggested considering data encryption for privacy during transfers. I encouraged him to ask for further assistance if needed.
