James asked if he can make the stir-fry sauce from coconut milk instead of the original recipe. The AI confirmed that it is possible, providing a suggested coconut-based stir-fry sauce recipe. The AI mentioned that the coconut-based sauce will have a different flavor profile and a milder taste compared to the original soy sauce-based sauce. Adding more spices or fish sauce can enhance the taste, but this would omit the vegan aspect of the stir-fry. The AI encouraged James to enjoy his dish with a tropical twist.
