James sought help in condensing a grant proposal work package focused on smallholder decision-making in fisheries and food crop production in Senegal and Nigeria. The AI summarized the key objectives and outcomes of the work package, emphasizing the analysis of smallholder decision-making under climate change, the development of bioeconomic models, and the evaluation of food consumption patterns and nutrient policies. The condensed version highlighted the research gaps, the importance of understanding smallholders' choices in the face of climate change, and the potential contributions to sustainable development goals. The AI's synthesis emphasized the significance of using biophysical and survey data to inform the models and the overarching focus on supporting smallholders in optimizing their production decisions while adapting to changing environmental conditions.
