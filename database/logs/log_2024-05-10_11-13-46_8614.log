James asked about substituting goat cheese and pesto in his pasta salad instead of mozzarella and another dressing. I suggested that the goat cheese and pesto would create a flavorful and adventurous combination, highlighting the creamy tanginess of the goat cheese and the aromatic savory qualities of the pesto. I advised James to consider the tastes of his picnic guests and potential allergies, but encouraged him to enjoy the flavorful substitutions for a delightful picnic experience.
