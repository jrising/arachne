James requested social media and website announcements for his new publication on the economic impacts of climate change, focusing on temperature variability and extreme events. I provided tweet and LinkedIn post drafts, an HTML block for his lab website, and a blog post outline emphasizing the importance of considering various climate indicators beyond annual temperature changes. The study, published in *Nature Climate Change*, highlighted the potential global GDP losses at a +3Â°C warming scenario and the heightened impacts on poorer, low-latitude countries. The findings emphasized the significance of integrating temperature variability, precipitation patterns, and extreme events into economic damage assessments for more effective climate policy and adaptation strategies.
