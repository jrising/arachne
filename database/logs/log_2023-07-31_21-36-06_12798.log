In the previous discussion, James asked if Plato referred to death as the "beautiful risk" in the Phaedo. I reviewed Plato's Phaedo and found no direct reference to this phrase. While the interpretation of ancient texts can vary, I couldn't find any recognized interpretation that matches James' description. James then asked for the Greek letters for "kalos caldunos," to which I provided the correct spelling: "καλὸς καλδοῦνος."
