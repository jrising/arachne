James sought a Dutch/Flemish name for a rat ancestor character linked to the Great Stranger Migration and the later comic-relief rat, Sergeant Buzfuz. The assistant suggested naming the rat "Sergeant Bussevis," connecting it to the Dutch/Flemish culture and phonetically hinting at "Buzfuz." This name provides a bridge between the rat ancestor and the future character, allowing for a playful and authentic narrative progression. Expanding on Sergeant Bussevis's traits and background can enhance the storytelling by blending historical accuracy with creative imagination in the lineage.
