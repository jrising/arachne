James inquired about an online tool he created for voting that forgets usersâ€™ votes after a short period. He provided details on how he uses `localStorage` to save and retrieve votes and suspected that the issue could be related to the Brave browser's handling of cookies. I suggested several solutions, including checking Brave's privacy settings, ensuring sessions are not incognito, and considering alternatives like IndexedDB for persistent client-side storage. I also recommended setting persistent cookies with an expiration time as an alternative method for storing votes. Finally, I advised reviewing the code for any inadvertent resets to the `votedStatements`.
