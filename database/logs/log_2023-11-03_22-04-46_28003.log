James asked for a set of countries to highlight in a graph depicting climate change losses. The countries should represent major economies, high-emitting countries, vulnerable countries, and key players in UNFCCC negotiations. Arachne suggested a list of 11 countries: United States, China, India, European Union, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Maldives, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. James then asked for their ISO codes, and Arachne provided the ISO codes for each country.
