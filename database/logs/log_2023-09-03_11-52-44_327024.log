In the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series by Douglas Adams, an advanced alien race constructs a supercomputer named Deep Thought to find the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything. After Deep Thought provides the answer as 42, the aliens realize they don't know the original question. To solve this, Earth is designed as a supercomputer to uncover the question, but it gets destroyed before completing the program. The characters, including Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect, engage in cosmic misadventures to discover the question but never find it. Douglas Adams intentionally leaves the search open-ended, emphasizing life's absurdity. The iconic number 42 has no specific meaning or corresponding question, allowing readers to contemplate life's mysteries themselves.
