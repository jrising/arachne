James Rising receives an email from Maryam Saadatmand, expressing interest in a Ph.D. program. James suggests the Environmental Economics or Marine Policy programs, asks Maryam to mention his name for funding consideration, and encourages her to apply by the end of the year. Maryam responds, expressing her preference for the Marine Policy program and inquiring about an application fee waiver. The AI assistant informs her that there are no more fee waivers available. James sends a follow-up email, clarifying that TOEFL or IELTS scores are accepted for English language proficiency, not Duolingo. He advises Maryam to focus on preparing for the TOEFL or IELTS exam.
