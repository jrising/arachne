James inquired about exporting tables from R to Microsoft Word. The assistant provided two methods for accomplishing this: using RMarkdown or the flextable package. For RMarkdown, James would need to create an RMarkdown file in RStudio, input the R code into the document, and then knit the document to Word. The second method involves installing and loading the flextable package, creating a dataframe in R, applying the flextable() function to the dataframe, and using the print() function to write the table to a Word document. James encountered an error when trying to install flextable on his Mac due to a missing cairo library. The assistant provided instructions on installing cairo using Homebrew, which should resolve the error.
