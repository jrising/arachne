The discussion involved organizing information about three activities related to the marine environment: Shipping Traffic, Offshore Wind Energy Development, and Anchorage. Details such as description, current status, spatial extent, temporal pattern, potential expansion/changes, stakeholders, and sources were provided for each activity. The importance of spatial planning and the use of tools like the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data handler were highlighted. It was also noted that the designation of the Anchorage area as an official anchorage ground could impact other ocean usage plans, such as wind energy projects.
