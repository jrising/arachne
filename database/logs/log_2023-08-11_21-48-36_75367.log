The discussion provided information on three activities: Shipping Traffic, Offshore Wind Energy Development, and Anchorage. Shipping Traffic involves the movement of commercial vessels in Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs) primarily in the mid-Atlantic and Delaware Bay. It is subject to strict international and national rules, has a seasonal pattern, and may see potential expansion with increased buffer zones and designated anchorage areas. Offshore Wind Energy Development refers to the development and operation of wind energy installations in BOEM-designated lease blocks within the mid-Atlantic region. It is still in the planning and development phase, and its spatial siting is influenced by marine spatial planning to minimize conflicts with shipping. Anchorage refers to areas adjacent to TSS shipping lanes used as anchorage grounds, with the potential to become an official anchorage ground and potentially impact other plans for ocean usage, such as wind energy projects.
