In this conversation, James shared his proposal for a project on estimating current climate losses and requested an outline for the final report. The project aimed to provide high-quality estimates of macroeconomic losses from climate change for each country and to be released during COP28. The report outline suggested by Arachne includes an executive summary, introduction, methodology, key findings, case studies, and conclusion. It emphasizes the importance of the project's purpose, provides an overview of the methodology used, highlights the main findings, and concludes with the implications and next steps. Arachne also recommended adding visual elements and using non-technical language to enhance readability and comprehension.
