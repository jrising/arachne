James received a referee comment on his paper regarding a comparison between the cumulative losses of $26 trillion in low- and middle-income countries and the annual GDP of the developing world. He agreed with the reviewer's sentiment but was uncertain about an equivalent stock-to-stock comparison. In response, I suggested several approaches: estimating the present value of lost income to align with GDP, summing past GDP over a relevant period for comparison, or using a measure of capital stock, like total infrastructure investment. I emphasized that the choice would depend on data availability and the specific context of his analysis, aiming to strengthen his arguments in the paper.
