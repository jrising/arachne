James is seeking assistance in filling out the Statement of Project Objectives (SOPO) document for a grant proposal to the Department of Energy (DOE) for the "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)" project. While providing the template for the SOPO, James seeks guidance on what information to include and exclude. The conversation focused on the formatting requirements of the SOPO, such as excluding dollar amounts, specific dates, subcontractors' names, and marking confidential or proprietary information. The assistant guided James in understanding the requirements and provided an overview of the project objectives section, emphasizing the need for clear and concise high-level goals and expected outcomes. No specific objectives for each budget period were discussed.
