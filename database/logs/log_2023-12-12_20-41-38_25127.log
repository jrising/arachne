She mentions her expertise and interest in GIS, Heavy Metal Contamination, Risk Assessment, Climate Change, and Environmental Pollution, which align well with James's research interests. However, Maryam doesn't specify the exact academic program she's interested in, making it somewhat ambiguous. Based on her background and interests, she may be a good fit for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics or Ph.D. in Marine Policy, both with interdisciplinary approaches. James is advised to encourage Maryam to mention him in her statement of purpose to be considered for available funds related to his research area.
