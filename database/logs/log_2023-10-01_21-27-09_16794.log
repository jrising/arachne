In a conversation with James, it was discussed how to match up datasets of coastal recreational activities. The term "paddling" was identified as corresponding most accurately to "kayak", although it may also sometimes include canoeing or stand up paddleboarding. Other activities, such as swimming, windsurfing, kiteboarding, skimboarding, and surfing, were determined not to fall under the category of "paddling". Additionally, it was clarified that "sailing" does not match up with windsurfing, kiteboarding, or skimboarding, but rather refers to the activity of using wind to propel a boat using sails. These insights were provided by Arachne, the AI assistant.
