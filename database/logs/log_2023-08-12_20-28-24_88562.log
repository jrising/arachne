James received an email from Nasrin Badrzadeh, a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering, inquiring about available funded Ph.D. positions. Nasrin's research interests align with water systems management, particularly in modeling and management practices on agricultural nonpoint source pollution discharges into river systems. James responded, suggesting that Nasrin may be a good fit for the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics program, which is the preferred program for prospective students. James also mentioned limited funding availability and encouraged Nasrin to mention him in her statement of purpose to potentially increase funding opportunities. The email advised Nasrin to apply by the end of the calendar year for full consideration.
