The conversation focused on the importance of financial support from the IMT board. I explained why the board should give money, emphasizing its potential impact on market transformation, influence in policy-making, support for research and education, proven results in energy efficiency, and ethical responsibility. We also discussed the necessity of 100% participation in gifting among board members, highlighting benefits such as setting an example, fostering unity, enhancing credibility, instilling commitment, promoting financial sustainability, and addressing legal or ethical obligations. Full participation signifies collective dedication to the organizationâ€™s mission and can lead to greater overall success.
