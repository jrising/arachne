The conversation centered around "Making introductions to foundations new to IMT," detailing a structured approach for connecting the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) with unfamiliar foundations. Key steps discussed included researching the foundation's interests, preparing a tailored presentation that aligns IMT’s initiatives with the foundation’s goals, arranging meetings with decision-makers, delivering compelling presentations highlighting IMT’s achievements, and ensuring efficient follow-up for ongoing communication. I emphasized my ability to assist with research, presentation preparation, and scheduling, aiming to facilitate effective introductions and potential collaborations between IMT and the new foundations.
