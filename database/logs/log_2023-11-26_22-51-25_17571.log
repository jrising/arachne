Matheus Fronza, a recent graduate of Temple University with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Latin American Studies, reached out to James Rising expressing his interest in the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. Matheus's research interests align with James's work in climate econometrics and modeling socio-environmental systems, particularly in the context of Latin America and the Caribbean. James informed Matheus that he would be a good candidate for the program, but noted the limited funding available. James encouraged Matheus to submit his application by the end of the calendar year to be considered for any available funds. James also suggested that Matheus mention his name in his statement of purpose to highlight their overlapping interests. Matheus expressed his enthusiasm for the interdisciplinary approach of the Environmental Economics program and mentioned reaching out to other faculty members with similar research interests.
