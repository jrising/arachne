The discussion focused on the economic features of the Delaware coast and the changes that have occurred since 2012. The AI provided information on the principle economic features of the Delaware coast, including tourism and recreation, real estate, fishing and seafood industry, and shipping and trade. The AI also discussed possible changes since 2012, such as the impacts of climate change, development and gentrification, tourism growth, and sustainable energy developments.
