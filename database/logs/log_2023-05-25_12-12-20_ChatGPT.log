The Delaware coastal economy, encompassing the region from Lewes to Fenwick Island and the Inland Bays, is a dynamic and multifaceted sector. The coastal economy is primarily driven by tourism and recreation, with the region attracting 7.5 million visitors annually. Residential development has surged, particularly among retirees, resulting in substantial growth in the construction and real estate sectors. The finance, healthcare, and retail industries also play significant roles in the coastal economy. 

Since 2012, the coastal economy has experienced remarkable growth. Factors such as residential development, remote work opportunities, and the region's natural beauty have contributed to increased employment, industrial output, personal income, and value-added. The coastal economy has outperformed the US and Delaware economies, with a growth rate of 86% in coastal value added. The tourism industry has also seen impressive growth, becoming the state's fourth-largest employer. The coastal economy's growth and transformation have broad implications for regional development and the need for sustainable planning and resource management.
