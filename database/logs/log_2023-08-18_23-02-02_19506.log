Delaware's marine waters are home to a range of species with key habitats. The North Atlantic Right Whale has designated biologically important areas for feeding, reproduction, and residence. The Atlantic Sturgeon has a critical habitat that requires special management. The Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark, and Summer Flounder have a Habitat Area of Particular Concern for targeted conservation. The region intersects with two Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2 sectors. The waters also serve as essential habitat for highly migratory fish and shark species, supporting their life cycles and contributing to a healthy ecosystem.
