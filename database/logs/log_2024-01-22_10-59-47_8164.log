James asked how to subset an xarray dataset based on one of its coordinates. Arachne provided two options: using the `sel()` function to select data based on labels, and using the `isel()` function to select data based on indices. Arachne gave examples and explained how to handle multiple dimensions and ranges of values. James learned how to subset the data and was provided with a code example using a sample dataset.
