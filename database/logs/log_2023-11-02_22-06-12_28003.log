In a previous conversation, James asked about the major negotiating blocs present at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings. Arachne provided a comprehensive list of the major negotiating blocs, including the Group of 77 (G-77) and China, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), the Least Developed Countries (LDC), the African Group, the European Union (EU), the Umbrella Group, the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), and the Environment Integrity Group (EIG). Arachne noted that these groups are fluid and may shift their memberships, alliances, or names over time.
