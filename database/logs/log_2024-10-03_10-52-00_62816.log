James sought clarification on the `\firstpage` command in the PNAS LaTeX template, specifically how to use it for a paragraph (#4) that spills onto the second page. The explanation outlined that the `\firstpage` command designates the starting point for the second page, requiring both the paragraph number and the line number where the overflow begins. The response advised identifying the exact line number at the page break, then formatting the command as `\firstpage[<line number>]{<paragraph number>}`. An example was provided, illustrating how to implement the command if the paragraph started on line 3 of page 2.
