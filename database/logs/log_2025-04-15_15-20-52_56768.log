In a previous discussion on April 16, 2024, James assigned reading from Chapter 16 of the Stern Review, focusing on "Accelerating Technological Innovation." Key messages emphasized the need for a shift to low-carbon technologies across sectors like power generation and transport to effectively combat climate change. The discussion highlighted the pivotal role of the private sector in R&D and the necessity for government-industry collaboration to stimulate technology development and reduce costs. It was noted that carbon pricing alone is insufficient due to uncertainties in climate change and technology deployment, and that a diverse portfolio of supportive policies, including enhanced funding for R&D, is essential. Overall, the conversation underlined the urgency for increased global public energy R&D funding to approximately $20 billion and the need for deployment incentives to grow two to five times globally.
