James sought to implement individual timeouts for each feed in his RSS aggregator using concurrent.futures but faced challenges with global timeouts. The initial solution using `concurrent.futures.as_completed` did not work as expected due to global timeout behavior. Our discussions led to modifying the code to employ `concurrent.futures.wait` for individual timeouts. Subsequent refinements addressed asynchronous task execution times by dynamically tracking start times. The final iteration ensured accurate individual timeouts by utilizing `concurrent.futures.TimeoutError` with custom timers. Ultimately, James achieved a robust implementation for managing concurrent tasks with individual timeouts in his RSS aggregator code.
