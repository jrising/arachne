James requested assistance in drafting an academic paper appendix on Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) for the social costs of CO2 and methane. The discussion covered introducing GSA, explaining the analysis steps and methods, and detailing parameter extractions. Key points included leveraging GlobalSensitivity.jl in Julia, utilizing multiple GSA methods, and combining importance measures conservatively. The methodology section outlined the specific steps taken to extract parameters, apply GSA methods, and combine importance measures. The focus was on understanding the variability in SCC and SCCH4 estimates to enhance policy recommendations and research insights in climate economics.
