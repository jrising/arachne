James asked for an anagram pun to end his handwritten addendum to his Christmas letter for someone who loves puzzles and puns. Arachne suggested the anagram pun "Preventing you extra pun: â€˜Puns are Nap Rugs'." The phrase is a whimsical rearrangement of "Puns are Graspin'" and conveys the idea that puns grip our attention and make us think deeply, much like puzzles. Arachne recommended using the pun as the ending sentence, saying, "Wishing you an amazing new year of puzzles and puns and... presenting you this extra pun: 'Puns are Nap Rugs'."
