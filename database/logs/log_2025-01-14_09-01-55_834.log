In a conversation about a proposal for engagement between Bank of America (BofA) and the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), James requested a focus on overall organizational alignment and relevant IMT programs. I synthesized the collaborative benefits of a partnership that aligns BofA's sustainability goals with IMT's mission for energy efficiency and social well-being. Key programs discussed included Green Lease Leaders (GLL), which supports green leasing practices, the Building Performance Partnership (BPP) that connects BofA to localized decarbonization resources, the Building Innovation Hub for industry collaboration, and the Corporate Engagement Opportunities (CEO) program for policy tracking. The proposal highlighted the potential for BofA to solidify its role as a sustainability leader while accessing valuable insights and data, ultimately benefiting both organizations in their sustainability efforts.
