This digest summarizes selected log entries of past conversations, providing a concise overview of the main topics discussed. It includes troubleshooting issues with `dplyr`'s `across` function, obtaining a covariance matrix from a Stata regression command, setting up voice commands on an Android device for URL queries, using the term "hackathon" to describe a day of developer project work, exploring an undersea electricity transmission hub, understanding the use of `reset_index()` in Pandas code, repeatedly calling an Ajax command until the server asks to stop, creating random forests from model trees using `ranger` in R, using the `find` command to list directories three levels deep, and handling categorical variables in the `ranger` package in R. The response to James's question clarifies that in `dplyr`, `mutate()` is called separately for each group when used after `group_by()`, allowing for group-specific calculations.
