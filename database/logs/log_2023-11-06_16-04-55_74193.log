In a conversation with Austin, age 3, Austin shares his interests, including Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, Disney princess movies, reading, the moon, bones and skeletons, "bad guys," dragons, pirates, and fighting with swords. Austin asks why houses are made of bricks, and the assistant responds by explaining that houses are made of bricks because they are strong, durable, and provide insulation. The assistant also draws a connection to the story of the Three Little Pigs. The assistant then asks Austin what his ideal house would look like and whether it would have space for a dragon or a pirate.
