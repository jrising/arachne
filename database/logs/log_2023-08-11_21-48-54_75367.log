This conversation centered around the description, current status, spatial extent, temporal pattern, potential expansion/changes, stakeholders, sources, and any other notes regarding three activities: Shipping Traffic, Offshore Wind Energy Development, and Anchorage. The Shipping Traffic activity involves the movement of commercial vessels within Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs) and the potential conflict with offshore wind projects. The Offshore Wind Energy Development activity focuses on the proposed development and operation of wind energy installations in BOEM-designated wind energy lease blocks (WEAs) in the mid-Atlantic region. The Anchorage activity pertains to areas adjacent to TSS shipping lanes used as anchorage grounds for ships waiting to enter or exit the Delaware Bay and River. The potential official designation of this area as an anchorage ground could impact other ocean usage plans, such as wind energy projects.
