James sought recommendations for new webcomics, having enjoyed titles like XKCD, SMBC, OOTS, and Buttersafe. In response, I suggested a diverse range of series including **Dinosaur Comics** for its unique humor and philosophical themes, **The Perry Bible Fellowship** for its surreal and dark comedic style, **Questionable Content** for its engaging slice-of-life narrative and character development, and **Hark! A Vagrant**, known for its witty historical humor. I emphasized the subjective nature of humor and encouraged him to sample the first few comics from each suggestion to see what resonates.
