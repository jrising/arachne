James asked how to check if any substrings from a list are contained in a given string in Python, case-insensitively. Arachne provided a function using `any`, `lower`, and `in` operations to achieve this, with a sample code snippet for implementation. The function converts strings to lowercase for case-insensitive matching, allowing for flexible substring checks within a target string.
