James asked how to create a vector in Julia with a value repeated N times. The assistant suggested using the `fill()` function in Julia. An example was provided using the variables `N` and `value` to create a vector with the given value repeated N times. The resulting vector was shown as `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, assuming N was set to 10 and value to 5.
