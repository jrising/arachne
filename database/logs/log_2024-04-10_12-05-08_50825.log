James inquired about the economic term "non-marginal" and its implications, suggesting that it signifies more than just "not small" changes and may involve nonlinearity or discontinuity. The response clarified that non-marginal changes in economics indicate significant departures from stability and equilibrium, potentially leading to disruptive shifts. These changes can be nonlinear, abrupt, and trigger new equilibria or feedback loops. An analogy to climate tipping points was provided to illustrate the concept further, emphasizing that non-marginal changes involve different forces and mechanisms beyond just size.
