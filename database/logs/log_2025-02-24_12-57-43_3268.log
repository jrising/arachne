In a conversation on December 24, 2023, James inquired about extracting specific observations contained in terminal nodes from the `ranger` R package. I explained that while `ranger` does not provide direct functionality for this, a workaround exists. The process involves using the `predict()` function with `type = "terminalNodes"` to obtain terminal node IDs for each observation. Then, by mapping these IDs back to the original dataset, James can identify which observations belong to specific terminal nodes. I provided a code snippet demonstrating how to fit a random forest model, predict terminal node IDs, and extract observations for a specific node. I encouraged follow-up questions for further clarification or optimization tailored to his dataset.
