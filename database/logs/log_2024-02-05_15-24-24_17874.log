In a previous conversation, James asked if it was possible to make links between lists in Google Tasks. The AI assistant explained that as of September 2021, Google Tasks does not support linking between lists or creating subtasks in separate lists. However, the assistant provided alternative approaches including using a consistent naming scheme, using task descriptions to provide information about related tasks or subtasks, and using labels in Google Keep to create a sort of "link" between tasks labeled under a specific project label. The assistant also advised James to stay updated on any new functionalities introduced by Google Tasks.
