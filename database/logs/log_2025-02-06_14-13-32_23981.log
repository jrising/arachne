In the conversation, James received an email from Nathan Borgford-Parnell regarding a synthesis briefing about sea-level rise (SLR) for the upcoming COP30 and an oceans summit. Nathan expressed interest in integrating James's impact modeling results from the Economic Assessment to create a compelling narrative for small-island developing states (SIDS). James affirmed his willingness to contribute, emphasizing that the short-term repercussions of SLR are minimal. He outlined the use of the PAGE model, which incorporates updates from the CIAM model focusing on infrastructure damage, mortality, wetland loss, and land value changes. James agreed on producing a parallel report correlating with the Economic Assessment and offered to discuss further via Zoom.
