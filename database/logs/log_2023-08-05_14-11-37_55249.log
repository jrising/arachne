James sought assistance in creating a glossary of terms for an article on climate risks from the perspectives of physical and biological sciences, and social science and economics. The initial list of terms was provided by Arachne, and James suggested additional terms. Arachne then added the terms "Exposure," "Biophysical/Process-based model," "Reasons For Concern (RFC)," and "Planetary Boundaries" to the physical and biological science section, and "Marginal," "Social welfare function," and "Economic damages" to the social science and economics section.
