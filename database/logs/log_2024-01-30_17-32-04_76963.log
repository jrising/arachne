The Delaware Ocean and Bay planning process faces significant data gaps when it comes to sand and borrow sites, which are areas where ocean bottom materials can be used for beach nourishment and other purposes. These sites are crucial for various aspects of planning, including offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience, sand and sediment management, species and habitat management, oil and gas exploration, maritime and navigation safety, and permitting for offshore infrastructure. However, existing data is incomplete and not easily accessible, hindering decision-making processes. Historical data is also not consistently available in digital format. The forthcoming BOEM Marine Minerals Information System is expected to address many of these data issues by synthesizing and providing improved data on sand and borrow sites, thereby enhancing the planning process by enabling better decision-making.
