James inquired about sharing computations between `renderPlotly` and `renderDT` functions in Shiny to avoid redundancy. The assistant recommended using reactive expressions to perform common computations once and then using them in multiple rendering functions. A detailed explanation and code example were provided, showcasing the proper implementation of reactive expressions in a Shiny app. The key takeaway was the efficiency and consistency achieved by utilizing reactive expressions for shared computations across different output renderings in Shiny.
