The user asked about the standard deviation of the difference between two normal random variables (RVs). The assistant provided a formula for the standard deviation of the difference when the two RVs are independent. The formula is σz = sqrt(σx² + σy²), where σz is the standard deviation of the difference, σx and σy are the standard deviations of the two RVs, X and Y, respectively. The assistant also noted that if X and Y are not independent, the formula becomes more complex and requires the correlation coefficient between X and Y.
