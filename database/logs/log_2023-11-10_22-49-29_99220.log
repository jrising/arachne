In a previous conversation, James asked about a creature from mythology that resembles a giant turtle with trees growing on its back, which turned out to be an Aspidochelone. Then, James inquired about an area in the ocean where gravity causes the water to dip like a bowl, and it was clarified that this phenomenon is not common in the open ocean. The concept James was thinking of, where ships have to sail uphill to leave an area due to the shape of the water's surface, was identified as a tidal bore. However, it was explained that tidal bores occur in rivers and estuaries, not in the open ocean.
