James sought help with a caching issue on a simple PHP-backed page, where Ajax commands returned stale content. I suggested several solutions to ensure fresh data was fetched: adding a random query parameter in the Ajax URL, using HTTP Cache-Control headers in the PHP script, and setting `cache: false` in jQuery Ajax calls. When James asked about using `cache: false` with `$.get()`, I explained that it could be done via `$.ajaxSetup()` or by appending a unique query parameter to the URL. Offering both explanations allowed James flexibility in implementing the solution effectively.
