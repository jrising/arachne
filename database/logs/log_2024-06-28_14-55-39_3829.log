James inquired about calculating spatial distances in Google Sheets using latitude and longitude data to find the row with the shortest distance to a given point. The response provided a detailed guide to create a custom Haversine function in Google Sheets to calculate distances, find the row with the shortest distance using the `MIN` and `MATCH` functions, and retrieve information from the closest row using the `INDEX` function. Additional support was offered if needed.
