James encountered an import error when trying to import `statsmodels.api`. The error message indicated a compatibility issue between the `statsmodels` and `pandas` packages. To resolve the issue, the assistant suggested two possible solutions. First, updating both packages to their latest versions via pip. Second, if updating doesn't work, downgrading the pandas version to one that is compatible with the current statsmodels version. The assistant provided the necessary commands for both options.
