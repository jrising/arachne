James inquired about how to create a new version of a project in a separate GitHub repository while ensuring the original repository remains available for bug fixes. I provided a step-by-step method to create the new repository, clone the original, and initialize the new one, emphasizing the separation of changes while keeping a clean history. James then asked how to copy over all branches and history to the new repository. I outlined a mirrored clone approach, detailing steps to clone, add a new remote, and push all branches and tags, thus enabling him to maintain a complete record and manage updates from the original repository as needed.
