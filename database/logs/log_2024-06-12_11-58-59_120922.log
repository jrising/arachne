In a conversation focused on aligning with DCâ€™s Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS), James sought examples of initiatives that promote neighborhood revitalization in low- to moderate-income areas. I provided several actionable strategies, including:

1. **Green Affordable Housing Initiatives** which focus on energy-efficient designs and technologies in new affordable housing projects.
2. **Community-Solar Projects** that allow multiple community participants to benefit from shared solar energy, especially for those who cannot access individual solar setups.
3. **Public Building Retrofitting** to enhance energy efficiency in schools and community centers through upgraded lighting and HVAC systems.
4. **Facilitating Energy Audits** for older buildings to identify opportunities for improving energy performance.

These examples reflect a commitment to sustainable growth, enhanced living environments, and economic development in targeted communities.
