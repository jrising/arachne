Chamanthi, a graduate teaching assistant from Sri Lanka, expressed her interest in furthering her studies in marine science, specifically focusing on marine biology and marine ecology, with experience in areas such as ecotoxicology, oceanography, and marine conservation. While not specifying a preference between a PhD and a MSc degree, her research interests and academic background indicate a strong fit for the PhD in Marine Policy program or the Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program with a Marine track. Chamanthi's interdisciplinary approach, as evidenced by her work on the livelihoods of fishing communities and the environmental impacts of a coal-fired power plant, aligns well with the ESM program. The response email suggests applying early for any available funding, and for the PhD program, encourages Chamanthi to mention her alignment with James Rising's research on climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling.
