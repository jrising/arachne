In a previous conversation, James asked if it was possible to apply an `alpha` transparency to the border color of a feature in ggplot. Arachne explained that `alpha` only applies to the fill color, but suggested using a combination of the `color` and `alpha` aesthetics to achieve the desired effect. James then asked about applying `alpha` according to other aesthetics, and Arachne provided an example using the `mtcars` dataset. In the conversation that followed, James clarified that he wanted `alpha` to apply only to the border color while keeping the fill as `NA`. Arachne then provided an updated example that demonstrated how to achieve this by mapping the `alpha` aesthetic to the desired variable and setting the `fill` to `NA`.
