In a discussion on statistical distributions, James inquired about which type lacks a well-defined mean. I clarified that **heavy-tailed distributions** often do not have a well-defined mean, particularly when their tails fall off slower than exponential rates, such as with the **Cauchy distribution**. We then explored **Weitzmanâ€™s Dismal Theorem**, which argues for the importance of accounting for catastrophic risks in climate policy. I highlighted that traditional economic models might underestimate these risks by applying standard discount rates to future outcomes. The theorem suggests using fat-tailed distributions to model unlikely catastrophic events, emphasizing the need for aggressive climate action today to mitigate potential risks despite uncertainty. Overall, the conversation centered on the implications of statistical models for understanding long-term environmental challenges.
