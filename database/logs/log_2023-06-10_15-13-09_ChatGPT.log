James, a parent of a 36-month-old and a 9-month-old, sought advice on managing bedtime routines for both children when transitioning the younger one to share a room with the older one. The assistant suggested staggered bedtimes, including the older child in the routine, synchronizing routines over time, creating a calming environment, preparing for night waking, and communicating with the older child. James also asked about sleep training the 9-month-old who still nurses at night and how to do it in the same room. The assistant advised gradual night weaning by reducing the amount and extending the time between feedings. It also outlined sleep training methods such as the Ferber method, chair method, and pick up/put down method. For room-sharing during sleep training, temporary separation, using white noise, and communication with the older sibling were recommended. The assistant stressed consulting with a pediatrician before starting any sleep training or night weaning process.
