The assistant provided steps such as staggered bedtimes, involving the older child in the routine, synchronizing routines, creating a calming environment, preparing for night waking, and communicating with the older child. James also asked about sleep training the 9-month-old and whether they should be able to sleep through the night. The assistant suggested gradual night weaning and different sleep training methods such as the Ferber method, chair method, and pick up/put down method.
