During the conversation, James asked if there was a word other than "organic" that related to climate, environment, health, or food and started with the letter 'O'. I suggested "ozone" as another word that fits this description. I explained that ozone is an essential component of our atmosphere and that the ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. I also noted that issues such as ozone depletion are significant concerns for both the environment and human health.
