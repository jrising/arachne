Storing pizza in the freezer in its original box can lead to a difference in taste and texture over time. The box does not provide a tight seal, which can result in freezer burn and the absorption of odors. Freezer burn can make the toppings and cheese dried out and have a slightly off flavor. Furthermore, the pizza can absorb unwanted odors from other foods in the freezer, impacting its taste and freshness. In contrast, using a plastic container or freezer bag creates a better seal, protecting the pizza from freezer burn and odor absorption. While it is safe to freeze pizza in its original box, flavors may not be preserved as well over longer periods compared to using a sealed plastic container or freezer bag.
