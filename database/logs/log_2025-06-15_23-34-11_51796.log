James is writing historical fiction about his ancestor, also named James, who married Elizabethâ€”sharing a name with his sister. Concerned about potential family interpretations regarding their romantic relationship, he sought advice on how to obfuscate Elizabeth's name. I suggested several creative approaches: using nicknames or variants like Eliza or Liza, selecting a thematically similar name such as Emma or Alice, playing with anagrams (e.g., Hazel or Bella), and combining names from other female ancestors. Additionally, I recommended that James inform his family of the name changes to clarify his creative intentions and encourage them to focus on the story.
