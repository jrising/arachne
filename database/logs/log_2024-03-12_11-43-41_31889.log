James sought advice on how to enhance engagement among board members with his foundation's work. I suggested several strategies, including aligning board members' passions with the foundationâ€™s mission, providing education about the cause, and setting clear expectations for their roles. Additionally, I emphasized the importance of offering meaningful work and maintaining open communication to keep them connected. I also advised respecting their time while soliciting their input to leverage their expertise. I highlighted that effective engagement may require tailored approaches for individual board members and is a continuous process.
