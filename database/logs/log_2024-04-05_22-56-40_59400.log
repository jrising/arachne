Ms Onyinyechi Chinenye Aghanwa, a potential Ph.D. student from Nigeria, contacted James Rising expressing interest in Marine Studies at the University of Delaware. Her background aligns with James' research on climate change impacts and interdisciplinary modeling. James suggested considering the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics due to funding constraints, emphasizing the alignment of research interests in the application. He also mentioned the new Environmental Science & Management program with a marine track as a suitable alternative. James advised applying early for funding consideration and welcomed further questions from Ms. Aghanwa.
