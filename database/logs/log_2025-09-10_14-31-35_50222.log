The conversation focused on the "Deals â€“ Deliverable 3" report, which analyzes how physical climate risks and national adaptation efforts influence sovereign credit assessments. James prompted a discussion on caveating study results regarding sovereign debt risk with insights from the report. Key points included the growing impact of physical climate risks on sovereign spreads and ratings, particularly in vulnerable economies, and the under-recognition of adaptation benefits in credit evaluations. The need for improved data and modeling to integrate long-term adaptation outcomes into short-term financial assessments was emphasized, as this mispricing constrains investment in climate resilience. Additionally, the paper by Klusak et al. (2023) was mentioned, highlighting projected downgrades in sovereign credit ratings due to climate change impacts.
