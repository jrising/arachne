James sought guidance on combining multiple parameter sensitivities in a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The assistant recommended summing sensitivities for additive indices, like first-order or total-order, but advised using the root sum of squares method for non-additive indices. Practical steps for grouping, calculating, and combining indices were provided, along with a Python example using SALib. The approach highlighted the importance of distinguishing between additive and non-additive indices to accurately represent parameter impacts in the analysis. James was encouraged to adapt the suggested method to his specific indices and tools for an effective GSA.
