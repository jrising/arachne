James inquired about "return on investment" (ROI) and its calculation, particularly when involving a stream of benefits. I explained ROI as a financial metric calculated by taking the net profit divided by the total investment cost, multiplied by 100. I highlighted the complexity of ROI with continuous cash flows and introduced more advanced metrics like Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). I outlined a two-step process: calculating the Present Value (PV) of benefits through discounting and comparing it to total investment costs. Finally, I provided the formula for ROI in this context, inviting James to explore specific methods like NPV or IRR based on his interests.
