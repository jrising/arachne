In a previous conversation, James asked how to show appreciation for a gift given to him by his new PhD student from China. Arachne provided several suggestions, including thanking the student personally, utilizing the gift in daily routines, learning about the tea, sharing the experience by inviting the student for a tea session, and keeping the connection by offering support and guidance. These suggestions aim to express genuine gratitude and foster a positive and productive working relationship with the student.
