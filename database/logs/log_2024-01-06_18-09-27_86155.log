James encountered an error "Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes" when running an SQL command to create a table in MySQL. Arachne explained that this error is due to the cumulative size of the fields specified in the PRIMARY KEY constraint. For string columns, MySQL uses three bytes for each character in UTF-8 charset. Arachne calculated the index length for the table and found it to be within the limit. However, if the MySQL database is set to use `utf8mb4` encoding, which stores each character in 4 bytes, the primary key size might exceed the limit. Arachne suggested several solutions, including reducing the size of `varchar` fields, using a different storage engine like InnoDB, or changing the character set to `utf8` if 4-byte characters are not needed.
