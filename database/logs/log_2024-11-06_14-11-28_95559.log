James Rising corresponded with Md. Emran Hosen, a prospective PhD student interested in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. Emran initially reached out expressing enthusiasm for James's research, particularly in Food System and Climate Change. James appreciated Emran's background in Finance and Banking and suggested he apply by the end of the year for funding opportunities. After Emran followed up on his application plans for Fall 2025, James affirmed his strong foundation but also noted competition with other candidates more aligned with coursework. He provided a form to help match Emran's interests with available opportunities, maintaining professional communication throughout.
