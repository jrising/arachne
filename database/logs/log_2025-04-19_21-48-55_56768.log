The reviewers provided insights on the paper assessing the economic benefits of the Methane Pledge. Reviewer 1 emphasized a lack of novelty, urging citation of similar works like Cael & Goodwin (2023), and raised concerns about the methodological rigor, particularly regarding negative methane abatement costs. Reviewer 2 found the paper timely and well-written, but recommended a more concise abstract and clearer methodologies. Both reviewers noted innovative aspects like the treatment of tipping points and distributional analysis. Reviewer 2 also encouraged a stronger discussion on public policy implications and the profitability of methane abatement. Overall, addressing the critiques on novelty, methodology, and policy discussions could enhance the manuscript's suitability for publication in a top-tier journal.
