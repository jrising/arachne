In a recent conversation, the project leader, James, outlined the formation of an advisory group for a grant project focused on the economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK and the benefits of adaptation action. The team aims to produce UK-level climate damage scenarios that integrate macro-economic impacts, emphasizing the need for UK-specific insights to address gaps in existing models like NGFS. Key objectives include enhancing understanding of macroeconomic impacts, informing public spending decisions, and facilitating adaptive decision-making. The project structure consists of scenario development, economic risk analysis, and macroeconomic framework integration, with an emphasis on collaboration among experts. The advisory group will provide guidance through four meetings, where members will inform tool features and contribute to critical discussions regarding scenario projections and adaptation results, ultimately aligning with governmental climate priorities and supporting global adaptation efforts.
