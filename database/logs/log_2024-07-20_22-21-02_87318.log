James sought assistance in calculating the mean of a distribution using quantiles and their values in R. The step-by-step guide provided explains defining quantiles and values, calculating midpoints of quantile intervals, determining weights, and computing the mean by summing the products of weights and values. The approach assumes proper quantile definition and sorted values, yielding the mean of the distribution for a step function representation.
