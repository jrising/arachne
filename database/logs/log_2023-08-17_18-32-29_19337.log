In Delaware's marine waters, there are two active disposal sites called "Littoral Placement Areas." These sites are primarily used for depositing clean dredged sediments from navigation channel improvement projects to maintain and protect the shoreline. The sites are regulated by federal and state agencies, and the database provided shows the variability in the "Primary Use" field over time. Additionally, there are three discontinued disposal sites within the planning area. In the vicinity, there is a municipal sewage sludge dump site, a dredged material disposal site, and a site designated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). Each of these represents different potential uses, contributing to the complexity of marine disposal activities in and around Delaware's waters.
