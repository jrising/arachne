In a paper being reviewed by James, the authors regressed emissions on either the annual price from a market or the trading volume (referred to as "revenue" in the tables). The AI suggests that the use of "revenue" may be a naming convention in economic analysis, particularly in emissions trading schemes. The higher the trading volume, the greater the financial flows within the market, facilitating the exchange of permits. The justification for using market price as an explanatory variable is that it represents the cost of emitting, potentially influencing firms to reduce emissions to avoid expensive permits. Trading volume or "revenue" reflects the scale of market participation and activity. High trading volumes could indicate an active market managing emissions effectively or a scenario where companies buy permits rather than investing in emission reduction. Both price and trading volume offer valuable perspectives on emissions behavior, requiring careful interpretation to avoid misleading terms.
