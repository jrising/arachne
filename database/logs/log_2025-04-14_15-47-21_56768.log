In a recent conversation, James inquired about the correct phrasing of “I think you, me, Daniela, and Swenja should meet.” I confirmed that the sentence is grammatically correct, explaining the proper use of the object pronoun "me" in this context. James then questioned why "me" being in a list changes its grammatical role. I elaborated that "I" is a subject pronoun, while "me" is an object pronoun, with the former used in subject positions and the latter when referring to the object of a verb or preposition. I clarified that in the list provided, "me" is correctly used due to its function following "I think," illustrating the differences between subject and object pronouns in such contexts.
