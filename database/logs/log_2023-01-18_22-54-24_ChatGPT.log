In the previous conversation, James asked how to make a vertical ribbon in ggplot and how to change labels in both `facet_grid` and `facet_wrap`. In response, I explained that he can use the `geom_segment()` function to create a vertical ribbon, specifying the starting and ending points using the `x` and `y` aesthetics. For changing labels in `facet_grid`, I suggested using the `labeller` argument with the `label_both()` function or a custom function. Similarly, in `facet_wrap`, I advised using the `labeller` argument with the `label_value()` function or a custom function. I provided examples for all cases to illustrate the usage.
