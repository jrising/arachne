In a previous conversation, James asked how to parse weather data formatted as text in Python, and extract specific fields such as WDIR. Arachne recommended using the pandas library and the read_csv function with a regex pattern as the separator. Arachne provided a Python script demonstrating how to load the data into a pandas DataFrame and extract the desired column. In a subsequent question, James requested clarification on how to interpret the wind direction values in the WDIR column. Arachne explained that the values indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing, given in degrees true, and are referenced to true north. Arachne further elaborated that a wind direction of 0 degrees represents a wind blowing from the true north, 90 degrees from the true east, 180 degrees from the true south, and 270 degrees from the true west, with the scale following a clockwise direction.
