James inquired about a country grouping that intersects geographical and economic classifications, possibly related to the UN. I initially mentioned the World Bank's country classification system, which segments countries by income categories: high, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low-income economies. He clarified that he was seeking combined categories like "North America High Income" (USA and Canada) alongside other income classifications in the region. I affirmed that while the World Bank provides distinct classifications, researchers often create intersectional categories using World Bank and UN data for detailed economic analysis. I offered assistance in locating specific sources or datasets to support his inquiry.
