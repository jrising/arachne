James encountered an issue with missing modules in Python 2.7 code, where `http.cookies` needed to be replaced with `Cookie` and provided steps for handling Python 3 compatibility. Later, James sought to install specific versions of `repoze` packages, and I guided him on using `pip` commands to install `repoze.lru==0.6`, `repoze.who==2.3`, and `repoze.who-friendlyform==1.0.8` either individually or together, emphasizing virtual environment activation and verification of successful installations.
