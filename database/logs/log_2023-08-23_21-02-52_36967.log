In a previous conversation, James asked about the term for the floor of the ocean. I informed him that it is referred to as the "ocean floor" or "seafloor". I also explained the different regions of the ocean floor, including the "continental shelf", "continental slope", "continental rise", and "abyssal plain". Additionally, I mentioned that the deepest parts are called "hadal zones".
