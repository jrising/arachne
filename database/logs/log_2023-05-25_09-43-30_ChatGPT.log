In the previous conversation, James asked for key research interests of three different individuals: Johannes Urpelainen, Myles Allen, and Catherine Wolfram. For Johannes Urpelainen, the key research interests are energy access, emerging economies, renewable energy politics, fossil fuel activism, democracy and international organizations, and sustainable energy transitions. For Myles Allen, the key research interests include climate change attribution, extreme weather risks, long-range climate forecasts, probabilistic event attribution, distributed climate modeling, and climate policy and net-zero targets. Finally, for Catherine Wolfram, the key research interests are energy economics, rural electrification, energy efficiency programs, impact of environmental regulation on energy markets, privatization and restructuring in energy markets, and climate and energy policy analysis. The conversation also included a brief mention of Elizabeth Moyer's research, focusing on atmospheric water vapor distribution, cirrus cloud formation, isotopic composition as tracers in convection and condensation, development of instrumentation for atmospheric research, energy and climate policy analysis, spectroscopic instrument development, laboratory studies of cirrus clouds, and interdisciplinary climate modeling.
