Camilla Kassar reached out to James Rising for assistance in extracting CMIP6 data from a shapefile using Python. After receiving the files from Camilla, James suggested two potential reasons for the issue and advised her to test them. Camilla inquired about the coordinate system for CMIP6 data, and James explained that a coordinate project system like WGS 84 is not necessary for GCM data. Camilla expressed her intent to test James' suggestions using Qgis and asked if she could continue asking questions. In response, James recommended that Camilla seek out local groups or mentors for regular assistance and suggested online forums and platforms as valuable resources. He also offered a Zoom chat for a more in-depth discussion. James drafted an email response to Camilla, emphasizing the importance of finding long-term support and providing helpful resources and contact information.
