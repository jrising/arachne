James sought a method to automate collecting dynamic content from websites like LinkedIn, recognizing the limitations of simple `curl` requests. The assistant recommended using Selenium for web scraping with JavaScript support. Detailed instructions, including login automation and content extraction, were provided in Python code. Key points highlighted included selector accuracy, login handling for anti-bot measures, adjusting load times, and ethical considerations. Selenium allows for mimicking user interactions to extract desired information effectively, even from pages using AJAX. James was encouraged to seek further assistance for customization or specific challenges.
