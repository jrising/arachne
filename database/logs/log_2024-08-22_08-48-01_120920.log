In response to a request for clarity on project familiarity and knowledge gaps, I expressed gratitude for the BPP fundraising discussion and outlined my plans for upskilling. I identified specific projects I am comfortable discussing and those I still need to learn about. I outlined steps to familiarize myself with the latter, including reviewing documentation, attending meetings, and seeking insights from project leads. I also requested additional context and materials from the recipient to aid in my learning. Lastly, I welcomed any recommendations for resources or mentorship opportunities to enhance my professional development in line with the goals identified during my onboarding.
