In a previous conversation, James inquired about the character Iago from Shakespeare's plays. I responded that Iago is indeed a character in "Othello, the Moor of Venice" and serves as the primary antagonist. Iago's actions are driven by jealousy and a desire for revenge, leading him to manipulate those around him, especially Othello, with tragic outcomes.
