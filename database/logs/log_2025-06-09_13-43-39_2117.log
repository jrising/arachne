In this discussion, James sought to create a consensus vision statement for SMSP from two existing statements produced by two groups. The first group's statement focused on cultivating a vibrant community of scholars and students to understand and manage coastal and oceanic systems, while the second emphasized SMSP's role as a global leader in scientific understanding. After collaboratively breaking down concepts from both, a two-sentence vision statement was proposed, distinguishing between community purpose and leadership in action. The conversation then shifted to developing a combined mission statement from two similar mission statements that centered on cutting-edge research and interdisciplinary collaboration. Ultimately, a refined version was proposed to avoid redundancy in language while maintaining clarity and emphasis on engagement with stakeholders.
