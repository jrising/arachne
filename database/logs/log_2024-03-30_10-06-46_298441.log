James discussed running ANOVA on a linear model (lm) in R, expressing confusion over the 'Sum Sq' column being only 5% of the total variance of the dependent variable. I explained that this indicates the model explains a small fraction of the variability and suggested including interaction terms using the * operator. I recommended using Type III sum of squares for a clearer view of variable contributions, achieved through the `Anova()` function from the `car` package. I also emphasized the importance of verifying model assumptions and suggested checking model residuals to identify potential issues that could affect the ANOVA results.
