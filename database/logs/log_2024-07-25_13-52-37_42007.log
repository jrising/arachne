The supplementary information describes the methodology for inferring missing data for taxonomically related species in R. It details data preparation steps, including reading and merging datasets, filtering home range data, and aggregating taxonomy information. The core inference method, `lowest.hierarchy` function, sequentially traverses taxonomic levels to infer missing values based on related species data. The approach ensures robust data inference by leveraging hierarchical taxonomy structures and proximate species information, facilitating comprehensive analyses and interpretations in studies.
