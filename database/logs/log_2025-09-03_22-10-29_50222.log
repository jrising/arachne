This conversation involved James seeking assistance in analyzing emissions from seven investor-owned oil and gas companies for Greenpeace. He provided R code for calculating damages by multiplying emissions since the Paris Agreement by the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and reverse-discounting to 2025. I offered a LaTeX document template to structure the analysis and discussed various methodological details. James requested an extension of the SCC extrapolation method to include the regression specification and details on handling emissions, including a cap on emissions and ignoring inflation for the GDP deflator in 2025. I provided a revised version of the document with these specifications and later updated the figure captions for clarity.
