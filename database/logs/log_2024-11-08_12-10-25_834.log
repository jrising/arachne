James sought a membership growth plan for their business engagement programs, including the CEO program, DC Hub, and Green Lease Leaders. I provided a strategic plan emphasizing current member appreciation, such as member recognition, loyalty programs, quality educational content, and networking events. For new member acquisition, I suggested targeted marketing, social proof via testimonials, and a referral program to encourage current members to invite peers. Specific actions for the Green Lease Leaders and DC Hub included showcasing success stories, workshops, and collaborations within the DC community. To engage CEOs, I recommended highlighting strategic benefits and facilitating exclusive roundtable events. I concluded by emphasizing the importance of offering value and celebrating current members to foster loyalty and overall engagement.
