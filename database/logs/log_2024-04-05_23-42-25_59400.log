Socrates uses the concept of mysteries in the Meno not specifically referencing the Eleusinian Mysteries, but rather as a metaphor for the depth and transformative nature of philosophical inquiry. The comparison highlights the rigorous process of seeking wisdom through questioning, challenging assumptions, and logical consistency. Socrates suggests that if Meno delves deeper into philosophical discussions, akin to being initiated into mysteries, he will grasp a richer understanding surpassing mere definitions. This metaphor emphasizes the transformative journey and commitment required in both philosophical inquiry and spiritual mysteries, enticing Meno to explore further into the realm of Socratic wisdom.
