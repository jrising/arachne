The conversation involved James Rising sharing his paper titled "Drivers of the Country-Level Social Cost of Carbon." The focus was on enhancing the PAGE-2020 integrated assessment model to account for country-level damages, mitigation, and adaptation strategies, thereby improving spatial resolution from eight regions to 183 countries. Key contributions included new climate uncertainty mappings, dynamic vulnerability models, calibration for country-level abatement costs, and consideration of subnational damage distributions. The resulting global social cost of carbon (SCCO$_2$) was estimated at \$219.75 per ton of CO$_2$. A strong case was made for tailored climate policies and the necessity for enhanced mitigation efforts. An abstract summarizing these findings and the publicly available enhanced model was also drafted.
