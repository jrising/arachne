James has provided a research statement outlining his interdisciplinary research program focused on various topics such as climate impacts, land use, fisheries, health, transportation, tipping points, and environmental equity. His research aims to understand complex social-environmental systems under global environmental change and develop transition pathways for economic and environmental sustainability. He emphasizes the importance of bridging gaps between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics to enhance our understanding of climate risks. James has collaborated with the Climate Impact Lab (CIL) to quantify climate risks and has led efforts to produce high-resolution risk estimates for sectors integrating climate and socioeconomic projections with econometric models. He has contributed to the integration of climate impact projections through the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. In addition to climate risks, James explores human-environment interactions and their policy implications, particularly in the food system domain.
