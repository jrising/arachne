LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regularization method that reduces the magnitude of coefficients and removes variables from a regression model by setting some coefficients to zero. The amount of shrinkage is controlled by a tuning parameter called lambda (λ). When λ is large, many coefficients are forced to zero, resulting in a sparse model. When λ is small, the LASSO estimate resembles ordinary least squares. Linear optimization's "bang-bang" solutions don't directly apply to LASSO, but the penalty in LASSO pushes some coefficients to zero while shrinking others. This allows for a continuum of solutions between zero coefficients and small but non-zero coefficients. The degree of pushing coefficients to zero and the number of coefficients affected can be finely controlled by adjusting lambda. LASSO's ability to remove variables entirely depends on the value of lambda.
