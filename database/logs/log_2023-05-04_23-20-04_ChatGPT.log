In this discussion, James asks about whether LASSO removes variables entirely or just reduces their magnitude in a regression model. Arachne explains that LASSO can remove variables entirely by setting their coefficients to zero, depending on the value of the tuning parameter. James then wonders if linear optimizations tend toward "bang-bang" solutions. Arachne clarifies that while LASSO can push some coefficients to exactly zero, it is different from the typical usage of "bang-bang" in control theory. The degree to which coefficients are pushed to zero can be controlled by adjusting the penalty parameter.
