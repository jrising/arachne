James proposed a project to estimate current macroeconomic losses from climate change for each country. The goal is to provide high-quality estimates of losses suffered by impacted countries to demand support from developed countries. The project will generate best-estimates of GDP per capita reductions and capital wealth reductions relative to a world without climate change since 1950. Short case studies on heat wave impacts will also be developed. The estimates will be produced using a machine learning model that combines existing research on the relationship between GDP growth and climate. The methodology section describes the literature review, projections using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, a random forest model to query the impact, incorporation of international effects, and a model for capital dynamics. Losses will be reported as the population-weighted median across Monte Carlo draws. The results will be released during COP 28 and prepared for academic publication.
