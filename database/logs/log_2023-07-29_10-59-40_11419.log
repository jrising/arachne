James asked for a way to create a text field in JavaScript (using flowbite) that submits when the return key is pressed, but not when shift-return is. Arachne provided a solution by suggesting the addition of an event listener to the text field that listens for the 'keydown' event. She shared an example HTML code for the text field and JavaScript code to create the event listener. In the JavaScript code, the 'keydown' event was used to check if the pressed key is 'Enter' without the 'shiftKey'. If the conditions are met, the default behavior is prevented using `event.preventDefault()` and the form is manually submitted. The solution allows for submitting the form on the return key press while disregarding the shift-return combination.
