James asked for a way to create a text field in JavaScript (using flowbite) that submits when the return key is pressed but not when shift-return is. Arachne provided an HTML code for the text field and JavaScript code to create an event listener. In the JavaScript code, the 'keydown' event was used to check for the 'Enter' key without the 'shiftKey'. If the Enter key is pressed without the Shift key, the default behavior is overridden, and the form is manually submitted.
