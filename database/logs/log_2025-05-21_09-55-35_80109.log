James inquired about how to entirely remove a file from a Git repository after it had been accidentally committed and pushed. I provided a detailed step-by-step guide, recommending the use of `git filter-repo` to rewrite the repository's history to remove the file completely. The process included backing up the repository, executing the filter command, force pushing the changes to the remote, and informing collaborators about the history rewrite to prevent conflicts. I also suggested running garbage collection to clean up the local repository. Lastly, I noted that if `git filter-repo` isn't available, a more cumbersome alternative exists with `git filter-branch`, albeit being more complex.
