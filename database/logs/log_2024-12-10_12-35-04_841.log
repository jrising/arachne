James inquired about key conferences for climate and energy efficiency in 2025. I responded with a list of significant events, including the **UN Climate Change Conferences (COP27)**, the **International Conference on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ICREEE)**, the **Energy Efficiency Global Forum (EE Global)**, the **World Energy Engineering Congress (WEEC)**, the **Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM)**, the **International Conference on Climate Change: Impacts and Responses**, and the **European Energy Efficiency Conference**. I advised James to check official websites for the latest details regarding each conference's venue and format, considering potential changes due to the global health situation.
