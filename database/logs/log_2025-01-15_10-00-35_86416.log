In a conversation, James Rising was approached by Arqam Tariq, a PhD student interested in switching to Environmental Economics, who detailed his previous experience in Pakistan's Finance Department and his research ambitions regarding sub-national policies and renewable energy. James sought assistance to draft a professional response to Arqam's email. The draft acknowledged Arqam's qualifications, expressed interest in his proposed research, and mentioned the lack of funding for new PhD students. James suggested a Zoom meeting for further discussion, inviting Arqam to schedule a convenient time via a provided link.
