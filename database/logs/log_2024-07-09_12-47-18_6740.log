James sought guidance on setting up a shared folder on his QNAP NAS with restricted access. He learned to create the folder, set permissions for specific users or groups, configure network access, mount the NFS share on the server, and optionally configure fstab for auto-mount. He also discovered that he could manage access by creating user groups instead of adding individual users. Additionally, he was advised to open necessary ports in `ufw` for NFS communication, including ports 111, 2049, and 20048. This method ensures controlled access and efficient management of shared resources for his lab without needing separate user accounts for each member.
