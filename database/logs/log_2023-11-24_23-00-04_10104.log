The discussion at COP27 on "Loss and Damage" highlighted the urgent need for financial support for developing countries experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. The lack of concrete commitments to provide compensation for historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions has been a point of contention. Key points of discussion included the need for financial support, defining "Loss and Damage," identifying funding sources, and establishing a new Financing Framework through the "Santiago Network on Loss and Damage." However, COP27 did not result in written commitments for new and additional funding, leading to disappointment among smaller island nations and developing countries. Moving forward to COP28, the hope is to solidify these discussions into binding legal and financial commitments to adequately compensate vulnerable countries for losses and damages. The challenge lies in resolving the contentious issues and mobilizing political will among developed nations to establish more robust support mechanisms and funding sources.
