In the conversation, James discussed the significance of planetary boundaries and ecosystem services as outlined in the NGFS Technical Document on Nature Scenarios. These concepts are crucial for assessing nature-related economic and financial risks and for creating narratives that project future ecological scenarios. The ESGAP-SESi approach employs twenty-one indicators of ecosystem health to measure the distance between current conditions and a "healthy" state, helping identify potential physical hazards based on ecosystem resilience. Additionally, the INCAF-Oxford approach focuses on mapping hazards to specific ecosystem services, illustrating the interconnectedness of environmental health and socio-economic factors. The conversation emphasized the role of ecosystems in providing various services essential for human activities.
