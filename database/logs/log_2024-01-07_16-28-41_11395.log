In the previous conversation, James asked how to add a dynamic menu to his website using jQuery SmartMenus. Arachne provided a solution where the menu would be destroyed, new content added, and the menu reinitialized. However, James expressed concern about the user losing their place in the menu. Arachne then clarified that SmartMenus does not have built-in functionality for dynamically loading submenu content. Instead, she suggested using alternative menu plugins such as Superfish, SlickNav, or MegaMenu, which support AJAX-based loading of submenu content. Arachne apologized for the confusion and provided links to the respective plugins. The synopsis highlights the discussion around dynamically loading submenu content and the suggestion to use alternative plugins.
