The email thread discussed the rejection of the manuscript "Large economic benefits of global methane action" by Nature due to significant concerns raised by reviewers regarding model use, uncertainty analysis, and scenario design. Thomas Stoerk summarized key feedback from referees, highlighting the need for concrete numbers, consideration of natural methane emissions, and justification of country-level estimates. The team agreed to enhance the manuscript by exploring the inequality impacts of mitigating CO2 versus CH4, analyzing the national distribution of social costs, and adding air quality co-benefits without new modeling efforts. A concise discussion on wetland forcing was deemed necessary. The group also suggested a Zoom meeting to streamline their efforts moving forward.
