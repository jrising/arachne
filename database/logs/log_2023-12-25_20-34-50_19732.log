James was experiencing an issue with his MediaWiki after upgrading, where the content in the `wiki_content` table was not displaying on the pages. The assistant provided several suggestions to resolve the issue, including checking the database prefix, running the update script, and verifying the integrity of the 'revision' and 'text' tables. James confirmed that the connection between the tables was correct, but noticed that the column name in the `text` table was labeled as "old_id" instead of "id". The assistant acknowledged that this could be the cause of the problem and guided James through the process of renaming the column to "id" using an SQL query. The assistant stressed the importance of taking a database backup and testing the changes thoroughly.
