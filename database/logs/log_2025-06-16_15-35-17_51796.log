James sought assistance in modifying HTML code to customize the formatting of `<ins>` and `<del>` tags, specifically to hide `<del>` text and render `<ins>` text in bold green. I provided CSS adjustments to achieve this effect effectively. Following that, James wanted to extract the final visible text, excluding any `<del>` content, using JavaScript/jQuery. Initially, the `.text()` method was suggested, but it included deleted text. I corrected this by proposing a jQuery solution that iterates through child nodes, selectively appending text from text nodes and `<ins>` elements, ultimately giving James the desired output without deleted text.
