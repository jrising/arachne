James encountered a stalling issue with `asyncio.run` in Python, triggering a `CancelledError` upon interruption. I suggested several troubleshooting steps to resolve the problem: 

1. **Review Awaited Coroutines** for proper asynchronous behavior.
2. **Check for Deadlocks** in the coroutines.
3. **Add Logging** around asynchronous calls to identify stalls.
4. Implement **Timeouts** using `asyncio.wait_for()` to detect long-running operations.
5. Utilize **Debugging Tools** like `pdb` to step through code.
6. Verify the absence of **Infinite Loops**.
7. **Simplify Code Structure** to isolate the issue.
8. Ensure proper usage of **Concurrency and Threads**.
9. Check for updates in the **Environment and Dependencies**.

Advising these strategies aimed to help James troubleshoot and potentially fix the asyncio problem.
