James inquired about the commonality of taxing small-holder farmers in poorer countries, particularly regarding the case of Kenya, which currently does not impose income tax on them but is considering it as part of a revenue redistribution plan. I explained that taxation on small-holder farmers varies, with many facing minimal direct taxes due to their importance in food security. I raised concerns about the potential negative impacts on farmers' livelihoods and productivity that taxing them could cause. I suggested alternatives, like supportive policies instead of taxation, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to development that empowers farmers and fosters growth. Finally, I offered to explore successful policy examples from other nations.
