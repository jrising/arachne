James asked how to check if Redis is available on his DreamHost server. The assistant provided step-by-step instructions: log into the server via SSH, check for Redis by using the command `redis-cli`, and if Redis is installed, the Redis command prompt will appear. If Redis is not installed, a "command not found" message will be displayed. The assistant also mentioned that if Redis is not installed, James may need to install it himself or ask DreamHost support for assistance, depending on his hosting plan. Additionally, the assistant noted that using Redis on a shared hosting plan might violate the hosting agreement due to excessive use of server resources, so it is typically used on VPS, dedicated, or DreamCompute plans.
