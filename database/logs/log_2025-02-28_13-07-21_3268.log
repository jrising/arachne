In a previous conversation, James inquired about conducting a meta-analysis using results weighted by \( R^2 \), seeking guidance on how to implement this method. I provided a step-by-step process, outlining data collection, standardization of effect sizes, determining weights, and calculating pooled effect sizes, all while emphasizing the importance of heterogeneity measures and sensitivity analyses. James then asked for justification for using \( R^2 \) times inverse variance and alternative accepted methods in academic literature. I explained the rationale behind this unique weighting scheme, highlighting how it emphasizes both study reliability and precision. I also discussed alternative approaches such as traditional inverse variance weighting, design effect considerations, and random-effects models, noting that while the use of \( R^2 \) in meta-analysis is unconventional, it may have theoretical support for integrating the strength of empirical relationships.
