In a previous conversation, James asked about the disease associated with not getting enough calories. Arachne provided information on malnutrition and undernutrition as a result of a lack of appropriate nutrients in one's diet, including both quantity (calories) and quality (variety of nutrients). Undernutrition can lead to conditions like marasmus, characterized by extreme weight loss and weakness, and kwashiorkor, characterized by swollen bellies due to fluid retention. These conditions can result in stunted growth, poor cognitive development, weakened immune responses, and, in severe cases, be life-threatening, particularly in children.
