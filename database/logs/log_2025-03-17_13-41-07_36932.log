In a past discussion, James sought a sea shanty for his son Austin, who enjoys stories involving "fake bad guys." I suggested three options: 1) "Santy Anno," which involves a fictionalized tale of General Santa Anna, customizable with imaginative pirate references; 2) "Blow the Man Down," an upbeat shanty narrating sailors' adventures, perfect for adding humorous villains; and 3) creating an original shanty featuring mischievous cartoon-like pirates, allowing for a personal touch. I encouraged James to elevate the playful narratives with Austin as the hero outsmarting these whimsical scoundrels, aiming for a delightful and engaging musical experience tailored to his sonâ€™s interests.
