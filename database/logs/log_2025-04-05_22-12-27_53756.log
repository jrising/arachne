James sought clarification on how to specify in JavaScript that he wanted to set an already defined global variable instead of creating a new one. I explained that to modify a globally defined variable, one should directly assign a value to it without using `var`, `let`, or `const`. I provided an example with a function that modifies a global variable by directly assigning a new value, ensuring it reflects the change globally. I emphasized that the variable must be defined in the global scope for this approach to work.
