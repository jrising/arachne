The discussion centered on creating a reading quiz to assess students' understanding of a chapter from Robin Wall Kimmerer's "Braiding Sweetgrass." The prompts included questions about how plants convey their stories, the significance of the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash) in indigenous agriculture, the benefits each plant offers within this relationship, and comparisons between traditional practices and monoculture farming. Additionally, students were asked to consider metaphors for indigenous knowledge and Western science. The generated multiple-choice questions aim to evaluate students' engagement with the text, focusing on key themes and details from the reading.
