The discussion revolved around the development of a course called "Coupling Human to Natural Systems." The course aims to introduce graduate students to the concept and techniques of coupling natural systems to human systems. The syllabus suggested a 14-week structure divided into three modules: Polynesian islands, marine fisheries, and global climate change. Each module covers specific topics related to the interaction between natural and human systems, including lectures and practicums using Vensim, a system dynamics modeling platform. The syllabus also includes case studies like Easter Island, the collapse of the Newfoundland Cod Fishery, and the Paris Agreement. Assignments and projects will provide hands-on experience for students to apply their knowledge in designing, simulating, and evaluating different policy scenarios. The syllabus is a suggestion and can be adjusted based on course requirements and student needs.
