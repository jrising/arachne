Developing countries typically have higher carbon intensities and lower abatement costs due to cost-effective emission reduction options. The explanation aligns with environmental economics observations and the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), particularly in Working Group III's chapters 6 and 15. The cited sources delve into regional abatement cost distribution based on carbon intensity and economic development stages. A more targeted read could be the Stern Review (2006) on the economics of climate change, providing additional insights into abatement cost disparities.
