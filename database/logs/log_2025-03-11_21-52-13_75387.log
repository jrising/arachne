In a conversation dated **2024-01-31**, James inquired about how to add extra space at the bottom of a graph in `ggplot2`, specifically for a categorical dimension. I advised him to utilize the `theme()` function with the `plot.margin` argument in `ggplot2`. I provided a code snippet demonstrating how to adjust the bottom margin using `margin()`, with the option to specify measurement units (points, centimeters, or inches). I also suggested considering adjustments for `axis.text.y` or `axis.text.x` if text overlap was an issue.
