The EMPOWER Community Benefits Plan focuses on creating a just and inclusive space within the Offshore Wind industry, promoting energy equity, and investing in America's workforce. The specific tasks include coordinating and integrating community engagement and equity processes, establishing a code of conduct, creating scholarship programs, and establishing a Community Advisory Board. The code of conduct aims to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment, while the scholarship programs aim to promote equity in access and opportunities in offshore wind. The Community Advisory Board will ensure community concerns are addressed and their input is considered in decision-making. The completion of the code of conduct, establishment of scholarship programs, and creation of the Community Advisory Board will be the Go/No-Go decision point for Task 1.0.
