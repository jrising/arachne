In the 17th century England, a "rector" was the clergyman overseeing a parish, responsible for spiritual and temporal welfare. They conducted services, administered sacraments, and provided pastoral care. Rectors received income, known as a living, from tithes or land to support their duties. The position was respected and influential, with additional roles in local education and charity.
