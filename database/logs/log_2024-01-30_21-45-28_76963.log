The Dewberry Engineers (2018) report identifies several significant data gaps relevant to Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. Key issues include sand and sediment management, such as the identification of suitable sand extraction sites and beach nourishment. Additionally, data gaps exist regarding sediment and littoral transport, synthesized oceanographic parameters, vessel traffic, and specific commercial fishing effort data. A comprehensive understanding of human and cultural use areas is needed. Lack of data is also evident in bathymetry, species and habitat locations (particularly benthic habitat and essential fish habitat), nearshore aquatic vegetation, and pre-existing infrastructures such as oil and gas pipelines and cables. Water quality data requirements encompass marine debris, harmful algal blooms, oil spills, and ocean acidification. Overall, there is a major need for integrated, high-resolution geospatial data to effectively manage and plan along Delaware's coasts.
