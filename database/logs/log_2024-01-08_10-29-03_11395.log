This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the macroeconomic losses and capital erosion caused by climate change, with a focus on the disparities in impacts across regions and economic groups. Utilizing a methodology that integrates 58 economic models and machine learning, the study estimates the current global GDP and capital wealth losses attributable to climate change. The findings highlight the vulnerability of low-income countries and tropical regions, which experience substantial GDP losses, while wealthier nations often benefit from climate change. The analysis also reveals the exacerbation of existing global inequalities, with some high-income countries witnessing GDP gains. Additionally, the research explores the complex relationship between climate change, economic outcomes, and capital investments, uncovering significant capital losses among low and middle-income countries. The cumulative losses since the 1992 Rio Convention amount to $21 trillion for these nations, emphasizing the urgent need for global cooperation and intervention to address the impacts of climate change.
