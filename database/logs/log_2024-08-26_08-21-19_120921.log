James requested a regional fundraising plan for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) that pairs IMT hubs with local funders and establishes Centers of Excellence. Key components included providing cohort members with curated engagement opportunities and visibility through IMTâ€™s platforms, while strengthening relationships with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs). The plan aimed to support place-based goals, secure Global Greenhouse Gas Reduction (GGRF) funding, and enhance Building Performance Policy (BPP). A proposed formal fundraising structure was outlined, emphasizing funder alignment, partnership development, local ecosystem building, and evaluation strategies, along with a budget breakdown for these initiatives.
