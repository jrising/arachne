The existing data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process, particularly regarding the use of Vessel Trip Report (VTR) data for understanding commercial fishing efforts, are summarized. The VTR data provide valuable information on catch landed by licensed fishermen, including vessel names, trip types, gear used, areas fished, species caught, and dates and ports of landing. However, there are several key areas where data improvements are needed, such as offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience and climate adaptation, offshore renewable energy siting and leasing, maritime and navigation safety, and permitting and siting for other offshore infrastructure. Additionally, there is a need for data on recreational fishing, including location, type of fish caught, and shore-based access locations. Closing these data gaps would support improved decision-making in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. References: Dewberry Engineers (2018), Trice et al. (2021).
