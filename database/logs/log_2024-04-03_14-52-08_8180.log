James reviewed an economic assessment for New York and sought guidance on the appropriateness of quantification versus qualitative review in different sectors. The conversation delved into the importance of integrating adaptive strategies, analyzing modeling assumptions, and providing economic insights in areas like cognition and learning impacts, harmful algal blooms, food safety, health effects of power outages and extreme events, and wildfires. Recommendations included enhancing the analysis of localized data, discussing economic feasibility of adaptation measures, quantifying economic impacts, and exploring cost-effective adaptation strategies. The suggestions aimed to deepen the assessment's comprehensiveness and align with James's critical approach to evaluating climate change impacts in New York State.
