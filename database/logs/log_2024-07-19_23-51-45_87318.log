James sought help on making a longer sidebar scrollable in a Shiny app. I provided a solution using custom CSS within the `sidebarLayout`, making the sidebar content scrollable with `position: fixed;` and `overflow-y: auto;` properties. The example code demonstrated how to implement this solution, enabling James to adjust CSS properties for his app's layout and design as needed.
