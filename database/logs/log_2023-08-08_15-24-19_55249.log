In a discussion about the difference between current dollars and present dollars, the AI explains that current dollars represent the nominal value of money in a specific year, unadjusted for inflation or deflation. On the other hand, present dollars, also known as today's dollars or real dollars, take into account changes in purchasing power due to inflation or deflation. By adjusting the value of a dollar for inflation, present dollars make it possible to compare dollar values across different time intervals. An example is given to illustrate how the price of gasoline in 1995 can be adjusted to present dollars in 2023. In conclusion, current dollars represent the face value of money at a given point in time, while present dollars are adjusted for inflation to enable comparisons between different time periods.
