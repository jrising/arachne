In this conversation, James asked about the meaning of the little circle between two function symbols in math, denoting function composition. Arachne explained that function composition is the process of applying one function to the result of another function. James then asked about computing f(g)(x), where f takes a function as an argument and returns a new function. Arachne clarified that this is also called function composition, but it is typically denoted differently, either using parentheses and functional notation (f(g(x))) or lambda notation with anonymous functions ((λy. f(g(y)))(x)). Arachne emphasized that the dot notation (f ∘ g) is typically reserved for the composition of two regular functions, not for higher-order functions that take functions as arguments and return new functions.
