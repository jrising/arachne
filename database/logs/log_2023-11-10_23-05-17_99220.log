James inquired about retrieving a URL as a string in Python, and Arachne suggested using the `requests` library to make a GET request and retrieve the content as a string. Arachne provided a code example demonstrating how to use the library. In a separate conversation, James asked how to find a `div` element by its class using BeautifulSoup. Arachne explained how to use the `.find()` and `.find_all()` methods in BeautifulSoup to locate `div` elements by class, and provided a code snippet as an example.
