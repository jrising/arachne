The Velux meeting on December 17, 2024, highlighted the organization's current constraints in executing projects in the U.S. market and the adjustment of timelines for the "Healthy Buildings and Living Places" initiative, now pushed to 2026/27. Action items include connecting with USGBC California and discussing collaboration with Oliver, who has recommended Velux. Plans for hiring a regulatory affairs role and advancing local strategic advocacy were emphasized, reflecting a need for specificity in lobbying efforts. The organization is focused on significant upcoming events like NYC Climate Week and Greenbuild 2025, while also exploring new markets in Poland and the UK for 2026. A research agenda is in motion to conduct comparative studies across different regimes, but there are challenges in capacity and maturity to carry out extensive work in the U.S. market currently.
