The conversation revolved around crafting a cohesive vision for the "Coastal Barometer," a tool aimed at monitoring the health of the coastal economy amid various risks and opportunities. Initially, two descriptions highlighted the coastal economy's vulnerabilities (flooding, sea-level rise, tourism fluctuations) alongside its potential for growth due to increased appreciation for natural environments and demographic changes. The proposed Barometer will provide a dynamic dashboard with indicators on economic outputs, environmental risks, and resilience, aiding strategic planning and land-use decisions. It is framed as more than a statistical tool, serving as a vital resource for fostering sustainable growth and better resource allocation in Delaware’s coastal communities, with future enhancements driven by stakeholder feedback. The synthesis emphasizes the Barometer’s role in transforming economic understanding and guiding sustainable development efforts.
