In the conversation, James asked about the most reliable field to identify ships in AIS data. The assistant explained that the most dependable identifier is the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Number. This seven-digit number is assigned to ships and ship owners under a global shipping framework and remains unchanged even if the ship changes its name or flag state. The assistant also mentioned that the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) Number and Vessel Call Sign can sometimes change due to equipment upgrades or ownership changes. The Vessel Name, although useful in human interactions, is not a reliable unique identifier due to the potential for ships with the same or similar names. The assistant emphasized the importance of considering data errors and intentional obfuscation when using any identifier.
