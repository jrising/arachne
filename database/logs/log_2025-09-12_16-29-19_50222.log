In a discussion regarding visualizing data in Julia, James asked how to create an overlaid line plot using two dataframes containing time and global temperature anomaly data. I provided a solution using the `Plots.jl` package, outlining the necessary steps to plot both dataframes (`before` and `after`) with distinct line styles for clarity. The response included a sample script that imports required packages, creates the plot, and customizes the labels and title for better readability. James was guided to run the script in the Julia REPL or as a script to achieve the desired visualization.
