James was experiencing issues with the `speechSynthesis` API in JavaScript when using it in response to an async function. The AI assistant explained that this might be due to browser restrictions that require `SpeechSynthesis.speak()` to be triggered as a direct response to a user action. The assistant provided a workaround by starting the speech synthesis during a user action and immediately pausing it. Then, when the Promise resolves, the speech synthesis can be resumed. Alternatively, the assistant suggested using a secondary function triggered by the `onend` event of the speech recognition, which ensures that the speech synthesis is triggered by a direct user action. The assistant provided an example code modification to achieve this.
