James inquired about accessing parameters in a Flask GET request. The assistant explained that in Flask, for GET requests, data is in the URL query string, not `request.form`. The assistant provided example code using `request.args.get()` to access `id` and `prob` parameters and handle them in the Flask function. James received guidance on modifying his code to correctly capture and utilize the parameters, resulting in the expected output when accessing the URL `GET /vote-updown?id=196&prob=0`.
