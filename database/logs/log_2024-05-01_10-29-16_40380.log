James wanted to parallelize slow calculations in R on a Mac and save results as they came in. Initially, the assistant recommended using `doParallel` and `foreach` with sockets for parallel processing. James then inquired about using forking instead of sockets. The assistant provided steps to modify the code for forking by using `makeForkCluster()` and `stopForkCluster()` to set up and stop the cluster respectively. By utilizing forking, James could achieve faster and more memory-efficient parallel computations on his Mac, ensuring results were saved as the calculations progressed.
