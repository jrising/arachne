In a previous conversation, James requested a recommendation letter for Juboraj Pavel, a recent Master's in Marine Policy graduate applying for the HKH-Arctic Youth Leadership Forum. The letter highlighted Juboraj's work on a project with the Delaware DNREC, emphasizing his skills in data analysis and project management. James later asked to incorporate the strengths of the Marine Policy program, which equips students with policy analysis expertise and a comprehensive understanding of marine resource management, sustainability issues, and climate action. The final draft recommended Juboraj as an exemplary candidate, noting his enthusiasm and ability to contribute meaningfully to the fellowship.
