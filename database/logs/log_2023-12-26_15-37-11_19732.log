In a previous conversation, James asked how to approximate the entropy of a continuous distribution described by Monte Carlo draws. Arachne suggested using a non-parametric entropy estimation method called the K-nearest neighbor estimator. She provided Julia code for implementing this method, which involves constructing a ball tree, finding the k-nearest neighbor distances, and calculating the entropy approximation using the formula derived from Kozachenko and Leonenko (1987). Arachne also mentioned that choosing the value of k can be challenging and may require some trial and error.
