This concept note proposes research for the Belmont Forum's Climate, Environment, and Health II call, focusing on the impacts of climate change on food production and the resulting consequences for vulnerable populations. The research aims to deepen the understanding of how climate change affects agricultural production and fisheries, emphasizing the importance of ecosystem services in supporting food systems. It also addresses the direct health threats posed by the degradation of these services, such as food scarcity, nutrient deficiency, and shellfish poisoning. The project intends to study the consequences for low-income countries and collaborate with researchers to develop tools for enhancing the resilience of vulnerable groups. Additionally, the effects on migrants and displaced individuals are of particular interest, considering their detachment from support networks. The project aligns with the call's themes of decision science, food security, and climate risks.
