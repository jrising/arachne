The concept note describes a proposed research project for the Belmont Forum's Climate, Environment, and Health II call. The research focuses on the impact of climate change on food production and the subsequent consequences for vulnerable populations. It specifically addresses the effects on agriculture and fisheries, emphasizing the importance of ecosystem services in supporting food systems. The note also highlights the direct health threats resulting from the degradation of ecosystem services. The project aims to deepen the understanding of ecosystem service channels and their impacts on food systems, and to develop tools or data to enhance the resilience of vulnerable groups. Additionally, the study will examine the effects of climate change on migrants and displaced individuals. The project aligns with the call themes of decision-science, food security, and climate risks to ecosystems and populations.
