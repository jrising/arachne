In a previous conversation, James asked if he could use the Linux `find` command to list all directories that are three levels deep. I informed him that he could achieve this by using the `-maxdepth 3` and `-mindepth 3` options with the `find` command, along with the `-type d` option to specify directories only. I provided him with the following command:

```
find /path/to/parent/directory -maxdepth 3 -mindepth 3 -type d
```

I explained that he should replace `/path/to/parent/directory` with the actual path to the parent directory he wants to search. This command would then list all directories that are exactly three levels deep under the specified parent directory.
