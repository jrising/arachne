James inquired about hosting a large crab restaurant event for 50 people near Dover, DE. I recommended several venues including **Boondocks Restaurant** in Smyrna, known for its seafood, and **Sambo's Tavern** in Leipsic, celebrated for its traditional crab dishes. I also suggested **The Crab Claw** in St. Michaels, MD for its scenic waterfront location, despite being farther away. Additionally, I proposed considering venue rentals for more flexibility by hiring a catering service that specializes in crab dishes. I advised James to contact these locations in advance to ensure they could accommodate his group and event needs.
