James requested a text-to-speech appropriate version of a PDF page detailing a study titled "Strengthening the Investment Case for Climate Adaptation," funded by the Gates Foundation and authored by researchers from the World Resources Institute and SOAS University of London. The page included contact information for the authors and a list of contributors from various WRI branches in China, India, Brazil, and the University of Cape Town. My response provided a clear, spoken-friendly rendition of this information, maintaining the essential details while excluding numeric tables.
