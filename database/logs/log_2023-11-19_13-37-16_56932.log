James sought guidance on finishing an apple-pear tart he had prepared. He had concerns about the filling drying out and whether to bake the crust. The assistant advised him to bake the crust until golden brown, check for doneness after 20 minutes, and let it cool before adding the filling. To prevent the filling from drying out, the assistant suggested using extra pie crust to create a lattice or cover the fruit filling. James was also concerned about a congealed honey-water glaze. The assistant recommended gently heating the glaze in the microwave or over low heat until it reached a brushable consistency. Overall, the assistant provided step-by-step instructions for finishing the tart and addressing James' concerns.
