James inquired about the implications of the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for a solar system, specifically if it would lead to a cash refund or merely increase his deductible limit. I clarified that the ITC directly deducts from the tax owed, not from taxable income, and any credit exceeding his tax liability could be rolled over to future years. James further questioned the situation if he had excessive withholding, leading to a potential tax refund. I confirmed that if his tax liability reached $0 due to the ITC, he would receive the full amount he had withheld as a refund, totaling $5,000, thereby clarifying how the ITC applies in relation to tax refunds.
