In a previous conversation, James asked me for the term that describes the decrease in temperature with elevation. I told him that the term is "lapse rate," which is used in meteorology to denote the rate of decrease in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and density with altitude. The standard atmospheric lapse rate for temperature is an average decrease of about 6.5°C per 1000m (or roughly 2°C per 1,000 feet) of increased height.
