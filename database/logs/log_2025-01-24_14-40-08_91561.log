In a discussion centered around a comprehensive grant proposal detailing work programs (WPs) and associated tasks, James outlined the focus areas, including scenario development (WP1), expanding bottom-up financial risks (WP2), top-down risk incorporation (WP3), macroeconomic framework integration (WP4), and adaptation policy development (WP5). Key tasks included developing projection scenarios that factor in climate and socioeconomic variables, collecting model results for financial risks, and employing meta-analysis for GDP loss estimates. The conversation also explored collaboration opportunities with various groups, identifying their proposed contributions and specifying the associated tasks to enhance data integration, fiscal risk planning, and adaptation investment strategies. Ultimately, the discussion emphasized engaging stakeholders and ensuring practical applicability of the research outcomes.
