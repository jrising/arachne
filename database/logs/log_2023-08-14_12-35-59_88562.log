The grant proposal, "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)," includes a Community Benefits Plan (CBP) with a focus on the offshore wind workforce and coastal stakeholder communities. The plan seeks to integrate diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and accessibility, contribute to energy equity and environmental justice, and invest in America's workforce. Key components include creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, developing scholarship and mentorship programs, holding public information sessions, forming a community advisory board, and collaborating with local workforce and educational institutions. The tasks to be performed involve operationalizing the CBP, implementing community engagement initiatives, and expanding and sustaining those initiatives over the course of the project. Performance measures will be used to assess the effectiveness of the CBP and its impact on community inclusion, energy equity, and workforce involvement. The ultimate goal is to achieve significant improvement in these areas through the project.
