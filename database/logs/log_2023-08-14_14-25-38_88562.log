The urban heat island effect is caused by surface materials that absorb and release heat, lack of green spaces, waste heat from human activities, urban geometry that traps heat, low albedo of urban materials, lack of moisture, and air pollution. Mitigation strategies include increasing green spaces, using lighter-colored materials, and improving urban planning for airflow.
