The urban heat island effect is caused by multiple factors, including surface materials, lack of green spaces, waste heat, urban geometry, the albedo effect, lack of moisture, and air pollution. These factors contribute to higher temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings. Mitigation techniques include increasing green spaces, using lighter-colored and higher albedo materials, and urban planning that promotes airflow.
