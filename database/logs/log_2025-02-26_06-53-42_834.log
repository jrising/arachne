In the conversation, James sought to understand the differences between advisory boards and giving boards, including their expectations and responsibilities. I explained that advisory boards provide non-binding strategic advice without legal responsibilities, while giving boards (fiduciary boards) have legal duties and financial contributions are often required. Later, James inquired about strategies to engage advisory board members and increase their willingness to donate. I provided strategies such as clarifying expectations, personalizing donation requests, and hosting engaging events. Finally, James requested a timeline to help transition the advisory board into a more active giving board. I outlined a step-by-step plan over a year, focusing on assessment, education, setting expectations, relationship cultivation, and progress monitoring.
