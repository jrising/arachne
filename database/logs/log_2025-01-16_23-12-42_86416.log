James sought a computer game to enjoy with Johanna, preferably something board game-like. I suggested several titles, including **Ticket to Ride**, **Tabletop Simulator**, and **Catan Universe**, noting their appeal for both of them. However, James indicated that the first few options explored weren't free. In response, I provided a list of free or low-cost alternatives: **Board Game Arena**, a free platform for classic games, **Codenames Online**, and **PlayOK**, among others, to ensure they could find enjoyable gameplay without financial commitment.
