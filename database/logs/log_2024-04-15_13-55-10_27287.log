James sought to create a "barometer" of the coastal economy in Delaware, wanting to include daily-updated risk indices. The assistant suggested measures like sea surface temperatures, wind speeds, employment data, real estate market trends, tourism statistics, air and water quality indices. Data sources included NOAA, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Zillow, EPA, and USGS. The assistant emphasized the multidimensional nature of the project and the challenge of obtaining daily updates for all indicators. James was encouraged to compile these measures for a comprehensive and dynamic assessment of the coastal economy's health.
