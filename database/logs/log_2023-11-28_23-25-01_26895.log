This discussion centered around the development of a grant proposal for a project investigating the impacts of climate change on food production, nutrition, and human health. James Rising outlined the full proposal and requested assistance in creating Work Packages for the Research Plan and the Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan. The assistant provided a breakdown of five Research Plan Work Packages: Understanding the Impacts of Climate Change, Mapping Ecosystem Services, Health Impact Evaluation, Stakeholder-Driven Bioeconomic Modeling, and the Food Security Futures Explorer. Additionally, three Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan Work Packages were proposed: Stakeholder Engagement and Involvement, Capacity and Resilience Building, and Dissemination and Policy Support. The assistant ensured collaboration among the institutions involved, highlighted the roles and contributions of each PI, and emphasized stakeholder involvement throughout the project. The proposed work packages aim to address the project's goal of improving food security in the face of climate change.
