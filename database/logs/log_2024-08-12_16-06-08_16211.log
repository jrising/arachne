James requested docstrings for two functions related to simulating energy fractions in vehiclesâ€”`simu_inactive` for basic simulation and `simu_strat` for incorporating a strategic plan. The docstrings provide a clear description of each function's purpose, parameters, and output structure. Recommendations for potential adjustments were offered based on the complexity and nuances of the functions to enhance the documentation's accuracy and usefulness for future reference.
