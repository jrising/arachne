In a previous discussion, James Rising received an email from Stevie Beattie detailing personal challenges affecting their dissertation progress. Stevie explained a debilitating health issue impacting family relationships and overall productivity but signaled recovery and resumed engagement. They requested feedback on their attached proposal before the final revision. James responded empathetically, expressing sympathy for Stevie's situation while also noting a concern regarding the proposal's approach to justice practices, suggesting a need for multiple stakeholder perspectives instead of a single objective function. He offered additional feedback via an annotated PDF and invited Stevie to schedule a Zoom meeting for further discussion.
