James asked how to use `re.split()` on a string-like object in an xarray DataArray. The assistant explained that the 'seg_adm' object is a numpy ndarray and can be accessed using the `.values` property of the DataArray. The assistant provided an example code snippet to demonstrate how to apply `re.split()` to the string value. The assistant also shared a method using the `.apply()` method to apply `re.split()` to a larger array of strings in the xarray Dataset.
