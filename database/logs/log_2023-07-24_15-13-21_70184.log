In a previous conversation, James asked how to create a faded white background for labels on a ggplot graph to make them more distinct when overlapping with data. The assistant provided two solutions: using the `annotate()` function or the `geom_label()` function. The assistant provided example code for both approaches and explained how to adjust parameters such as fill color, label padding, and transparency level. James decided to use the `geom_label()` solution and then asked how to remove the rounded rectangle around the labels. The assistant suggested setting the `label.r` parameter to 0, and provided updated example code. James can adjust other parameters as desired to achieve the desired appearance.
