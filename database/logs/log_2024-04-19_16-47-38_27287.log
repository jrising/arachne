James sought guidance on creating a country-level global map in ggplot based on ISO codes and data columns. The initial response detailed using `ggplot2`, `rnaturalearth`, and `rnaturalearthdata`. The assistant illustrated merging dataframes with world map data and provided code for creating the map. When asked about using a downloaded shapefile, the assistant suggested directly loading the shapefile with `sf` and adjusting the code accordingly. This approach allows more control over map customization by incorporating user-downloaded shapefiles for mapping purposes.
