In a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018) on offshore aquaculture siting, key issues and data requirements for Delaware's ocean and bay planning process are identified. These include the need to identify suitable areas and species for aquaculture, understand ocean health and human impacts on water quality, and minimize the negative impacts of proposed projects. The report outlines several data requirements, such as jurisdictions and regulated areas, abundance and distribution of marine species, synthesized oceanographic parameters, vessel monitoring and trip reports for commercial fishing effort, vessel traffic information, human and cultural use areas, bathymetry, species and habitat locations, and water quality parameters. By recognizing and addressing these data requirements, the spatial planning process can better ensure sustainable practices and effective aquaculture siting. The report highlights areas where data gaps may exist, emphasizing the need for improved data collection and availability to support the growth of a vibrant offshore aquaculture industry in Delaware.
