James explored how Roman philosophers viewed early Christianity through Edward Gibbon's work, highlighting a tension in their perspective. The Roman elite's engagement with religion was multifaceted, viewing it as symbolically important for societal cohesion rather than personal belief. They valued tradition and were skeptical of new beliefs, like Christianity, that challenged the status quo. Educated Romans saw Christianity as appealing to the lower classes, reinforcing their view of it as superstition versus their philosophical approach to polytheism. Their nuanced position allowed them to participate in religious practices while maintaining a philosophical skepticism.
