In a previous conversation, James asked how to fix a problem with the legends in ggplot2 when using alpha=.1 as a heat map. The assistant suggested using `override.aes` in the `guide_legend` function to modify the alpha value solely for the legend. The assistant provided an example code showing how to implement this solution. By using `guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))`, the alpha levels set for the plot remained the same, while the legend became fully opaque with an alpha of 1. This allowed the colors to be easily visible in the legends while still maintaining the desired alpha value for the plot.
