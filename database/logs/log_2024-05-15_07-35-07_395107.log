James expressed concern about losing important data on his Linux server due to hard drive crashes and sought options for quick recovery and frequent backups. I recommended several methods, including using `rsync` for backups to external drives or NAS, remote backups via SSH, cloud services, and dedicated backup programs. We discussed the advantages of custom backup equipment versus standard external hard drives, emphasizing increased reliability, scalability, centralized management, and enhanced security features. James then asked if 5TB of storage is too small for a NAS, to which I explained that it is an appropriate size, highlighting the benefits of a NAS for centralized storage, data protection, and scalability, even at that capacity.
