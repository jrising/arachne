James sought assistance in reshaping a data frame in R to create a wider format with specific column naming conventions. He provided sample data and requested a method to generate a new data frame with a row for each year, crop, and poly_id, while combining columns like “edd_0_plant” with identifiers such as “IRC” and “Barley.” I recommended using the `tidyr` package's `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions to achieve this transformation, and I provided a sample code snippet to illustrate the process. James expressed gratitude for the help.
