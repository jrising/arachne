In the conversation, James prompted with, "the dragon have wings," leading to a discussion about dragon depictions. I confirmed that dragons are commonly portrayed with wings in mythology, comparing them to bat-like structures. I also highlighted their symbolic significance, such as power and freedom, across various legends. Furthermore, I noted that some dragons, like those in Chinese folklore, are wingless and serpentine. This distinction adds depth to the understanding of dragons in different cultures.
