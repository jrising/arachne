In this conversation, James asked for help in responding to an email from Nasrin, a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering, who inquired about available funded Ph.D. positions. James reviewed Nasrin's accomplishments and suggested that she might be interested in the Ph.D. in Marine Policy, given her strong background in water systems management. He highlighted the limited funding availability and encouraged Nasrin to mention him in her statement of purpose to increase her chances of securing funding. James also offered the option of reaching out to Xinfeng Liang regarding natural science programs. The response email provided a template for James to use, expressing appreciation for Nasrin's inquiry and urging her to submit her application by the end of the year.
