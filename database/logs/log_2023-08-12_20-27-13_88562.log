In this conversation, James Rising receives an email from Nasrin Badrzadeh, a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering, expressing interest in a funded Ph.D. position. James responds by acknowledging Nasrin's accomplishments and suggests that she may be interested in the Ph.D. in Marine Policy program, given her background in water systems management. James explains that limited funding is available and encourages Nasrin to mention him in her statement of purpose to increase her chances of receiving funding. He advises Nasrin to submit her application by the end of the year and provides the contact information for Xinfeng Liang, who oversees the natural science programs if Nasrin's interests lie in that area. The response is kept brief while expressing an encouraging tone.
