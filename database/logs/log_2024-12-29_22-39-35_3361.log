James inquired about skills 17th-century sailors needed and sought a phrase that emphasized their proficiency in quoting scripture over their sailing abilities, specifically looking for alliteration. I provided a list of essential skills including seamanship, rigging, navigation, maintenance, cargo management, health and safety, and watchkeeping. I suggested phrases such as "better at quoting scripture than steering sails" or "securing sails." James then proposed "better at reciting scripture than resetting sails," which I praised for its rhythmic quality and effective contrast.
