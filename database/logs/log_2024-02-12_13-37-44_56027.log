James attempted to hang a heavy shelf on his drywall wall using drywall anchors, but the shelf fell because the holes became too large for the anchors. Arachne provided James with four options to salvage the situation: using larger anchors or toggle bolts, filling the holes and reinstalling new anchors, locating a wall stud, or using a stabilizing plate. Arachne also advised James to choose the correct anchor for the weight of the object and consider using toggle bolts for heavier items in the future.
