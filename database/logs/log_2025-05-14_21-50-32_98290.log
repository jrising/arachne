In our discussion, James inquired about the economic concept related to ethical dilemmas stemming from potential choices by agents. I explained that this relates to "moral hazard" and the "principal-agent problem," where an agent may act in self-interest, potentially leading to unethical outcomes. We further explored the moral hazard problem in geoengineering, where large-scale climate interventions could lead to overreliance, incentivized negligence, uneven impacts, and unintended long-term consequences. This highlights the tension between technological solutions, like geoengineering, and the critical need for behavioral and policy changes to comprehensively address climate change.
