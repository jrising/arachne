In a previous conversation, James requested a Lin Manuel Miranda-style song for Camilo's self-discovery in Encanto, and Arachne created "Shifting Shapes, Steadfast Heart." James also asked for the term for developers working on projects for a day, and Arachne said it's called a hackathon. There was a discussion about adult musicals similar to Disney princess movies, with Arachne suggesting "Wicked," "Anastasia," "Frozen" (Broadway), "The Little Mermaid" (Broadway), and "Cinderella." James inquired about the duration of building a new nuclear power plant and a name for a folded piece of paper with students' names. Arachne mentioned that the building process varies from 5-10 years and suggested "name tag" or "place card." Finally, James asked about the term econometricians use for the black-box relationships they find, and Arachne responded that they are called "econometric models."
