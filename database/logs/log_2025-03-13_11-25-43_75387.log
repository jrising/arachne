In a previous discussion, James inquired about Hector and fldgen. I explained that Hector is an open-source simplified climate model for simulating greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, and global temperature changes. It's useful for climate policy analysis, education, and research. I also highlighted fldgen, a statistical tool for generating synthetic climate fields, which helps analyze uncertainty and explore the variability of climate-related data. Both tools are valuable for climate modeling and understanding the implications of different emission scenarios and climate change impacts. I offered further assistance for their integration into James's work.
