James asked Arachne about the lack of information on the pelagic duration of non-fish marine species in Sealifebase compared to Fishbase. Arachne explained that this gap in knowledge is due to the challenges of monitoring and researching microscopic and widely dispersed larvae of marine invertebrates. Additionally, the diversity of larval stages in different species, including the variations in pelagic larval duration (PLD), further complicates the availability of comprehensive data. Arachne suggested considering a range of PLD values for each species based on taxonomic group or ecological function, while considering factors such as spawning season and temperature that may influence development time. It was also recommended to consult literature and experts for guidance when modeling the PLD of non-fish marine species.
