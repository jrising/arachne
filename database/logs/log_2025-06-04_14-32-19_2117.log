In a previous discussion on January 13, 2025, James inquired about visualizing an exponential decay relationship in `ggplot2` using the formula `log(y) ~ x`, seeking a smooth curve instead of a straight line from a linear model. I provided a code example illustrating how to fit the model, make predictions, and plot a smooth curve through the original scale using `geom_line()`. Later, James asked if uncertainty bounds similar to those in `geom_smooth()` could be included. I responded with an updated approach that incorporates uncertainty bounds by calculating confidence intervals for predictions, transforming them back to the original scale, and using `geom_ribbon()` to display these bounds alongside the fitted curve.
