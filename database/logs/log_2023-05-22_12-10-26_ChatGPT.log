James had an issue with his Outlook calendar not syncing with his iPhone, and I provided him with troubleshooting steps. He also asked about abbreviating million dollars, and I suggested using "M". In addition, he asked for an abbreviation for "Number of Employed People" in a column header, and I suggested "No. Employed" or "Emp. Count". Finally, he inquired about the NAICS industry labeled "Information", and I explained that it includes industries involved in producing and distributing information and cultural products, providing means for transmission or distribution, and offering data and communications support.
