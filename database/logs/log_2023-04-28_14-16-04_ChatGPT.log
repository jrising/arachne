In this discussion, James asks for readings to wrap up his course on the Philosophy of Research. The assistant provides a list of ten readings that cover various aspects of good research, including topics such as scientific revolutions, falsifiability, diverse perspectives in research, the influence of social factors on scientific practices, and ethical issues in research. These readings aim to synthesize discussions on society, ethics, empiricism, and methods, providing a comprehensive understanding of good research in the context of the Philosophy of Research.
