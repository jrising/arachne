In a conversation about seeking readings to conclude a course on the Philosophy of Research, the assistant suggests a list of ten readings that cover various aspects of good research, including society, ethics, empiricism, and methods. The suggested readings include influential works such as "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Kuhn, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" by Popper, and "Against Method" by Feyerabend. Other readings explore the relationship between power and knowledge production ("Whose Science? Whose Knowledge?" by Harding), the influence of social factors on scientific practice ("Science as Social Knowledge" by Longino), and the construction of scientific facts ("Laboratory Life" by Latour and Woolgar). The assistant also recommends readings on ethics in research ("Ethics of Science" by Resnik), the sociology of science ("The Sociology of Science" by Merton), and the scientific attitude ("The Scientific Attitude" by McIntyre). Lastly, the assistant suggests a book examining the manipulation of scientific research for ulterior motives ("Merchants of Doubt" by Oreskes and Conway). Overall, the readings provide a comprehensive understanding of good research practices and will facilitate thoughtful discussions to conclude the course.
