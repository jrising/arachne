In a discussion led by James regarding the grant proposal "Accelerating Investment in Adaptation and Resilience by Economic Decision-Makers," key points included the urgent need for increased adaptation funding and the role of economic decision-makers, particularly Finance Ministers, in addressing climate change impacts. The conversation focused on outlining the project's objectives, which include conducting a global review of macroeconomic costs of inaction, developing case studies from various countries, and creating actionable insights for policymakers. James emphasized the importance of interviews with stakeholders to gather contextual insights, validate findings, and provide actionable recommendations. The proposed methodology combines literature reviews, case studies, and stakeholder engagement to effectively communicate the economic benefits of adaptation, ultimately aiming to drive policy change ahead of COP30 in Bel√©m, Brazil.
