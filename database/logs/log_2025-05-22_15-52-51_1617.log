James sought help selecting from an `xarray.Dataset` using an index (`poly_idx`) but encountered a ValueError related to geometry objects. I diagnosed the issue, suggesting he check the dataset's dimensionality and inspect the data closely. He confirmed that `poly_idx` had 37 indices and showed that the geometries were accessed correctly. I advised directly accessing geometry data to ensure it was a 1-dimensional array of valid geometry objects. Additionally, I recommended debugging item types, printing the dataset structure, and updating relevant libraries if problems persisted.
