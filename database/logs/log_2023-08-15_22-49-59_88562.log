In a previous conversation, James asked how to change the title on legends in QGIS's layout system. I provided step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish this. The process involves opening the Layout Manager, selecting the desired layout, choosing the legend to modify, opening the Item Properties, and editing the Title field under Legend Items. I advised James to hit Enter or click away from the field after making changes, and to save the layout for the modified legend title to appear.
