The initiative aims to support under-resourced buildings that currently do not meet the Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS) Cycle 1, focusing on various facility types such as co-ops, healthcare facilities, and worship facilities. IMT will manage the project by hiring industry experts for technical support, with close involvement from the DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) and other stakeholders. DCSEU will participate in outreach and pipeline development to enhance compliance efforts. The success of the BEPS program exemplifies effective collaboration with DCSEU, showcasing IMT's ability to leverage its experience and partnerships in delivering targeted support to ensure energy efficiency and sustainability for under-resourced buildings.
