In Washington, D.C., where buildings account for over 70% of carbon emissions, the city targets a 50% reduction in energy use by 2032 and aims for carbon neutrality by 2045. Coupled with these goals is a commitment to enhancing wealth in minority communities and addressing environmental injustices. An estimated 3,000 - 4,000 skilled jobs will be needed in building-related fields by 2045, but there is a significant skills gap. The Building Innovation Hub will address this through three initiatives—BIPOC Contractor Incubator, Vendor Matchmaking, and Green Buildings Career Map—focused on underserved and minority populations. These projects aim to increase BIPOC representation in the green building sector, enhance compliance with Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS), and create more job and business opportunities, ultimately boosting community wealth.
