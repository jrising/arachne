The discussion centered on the methods used to estimate missing climate risks in a research paper. James introduced two approaches: the first method involves assessing a comprehensive list of risk channels outlined in CCRA3, using a range of monetary estimates to produce mean and standard deviation values while accounting for double-counting and covariance. The resulting estimates are 0.11% GDP in the current period, decreasing to 0.04% GDP by century's end. The second method follows Nordhaus (2013), estimating missing risks as 25% of known risks, determined through bootstrap sampling methods over 1000 Monte Carlo iterations, yielding a loss of 0.66% GDP currently, increasing to 2.06% by century's end. The interaction also included a detailed description of the coding process used to generate Nordhaus missing risks, which involved data preparation, aggregation, and Monte Carlo simulations. The responses affirmed the coherence of the methods presented and highlighted their significance in understanding climate risk impacts.
