James requested a vegetarian dinner recipe using bell peppers, celery, and carrots. The assistant provided a simple recipe for a vegetarian stir-fry that incorporates these ingredients. The recipe includes thinly sliced bell peppers, celery, and carrots, along with onion and garlic saut√©ed in vegetable oil. The vegetables are stir-fried until crisp-tender, and a sauce made from soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, salt, and pepper is added. The stir-fry can be served over rice or noodles, and James can customize it by adding other vegetables or ingredients like tofu, mushrooms, or cashews for extra protein and texture. The assistant encourages James to enjoy his delicious and speedy vegetarian stir-fry.
