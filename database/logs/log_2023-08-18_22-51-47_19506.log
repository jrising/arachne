Delaware's marine waters are home to several key species and habitats that require careful planning and conservation strategies. This includes critical habitat for the Atlantic Sturgeon and a biologically important area for the North Atlantic Right Whale. The waters are also designated as a Habitat Area of Particular Concern for the Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark, and Summer Flounder, as well as overlapped by two Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2 areas. Additionally, the waters serve as essential habitats for a variety of highly migratory fish species and shark species.
