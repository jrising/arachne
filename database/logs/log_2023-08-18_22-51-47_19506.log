Delaware marine waters are a critical habitat for various species, including the Atlantic Sturgeon and the North Atlantic Right Whale. They are also designated as a Habitat Area of Particular Concern for the Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark, and Summer Flounder, with overlap in Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2 areas. Moreover, these waters serve as essential habitats for highly migratory fish species such as Albacore Tuna, Bigeye Tuna, Bluefin Tuna, and Swordfish. Additionally, they provide crucial habitats for numerous migratory shark species, including the Atlantic Angel Shark, Blue Shark, and Tiger Shark. The precious biodiversity found in Delaware's marine waters underscores the need for careful planning and robust conservation strategies to protect these species and maintain the ecological health of the region.
