James inquired about a Git repository where a submodule was missing after trying to pull it on a different server. I explained that when cloning a repository with submodules, they aren't automatically initialized. To address the issue, I provided steps to follow: (1) clone with `--recurse-submodules` if not cloned yet, and (2) for an already cloned repository, run `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update`, or use the combined command `git submodule update --init --recursive`. I also mentioned how to update submodules later using `git pull --recurse-submodules` or `git submodule update --recursive --remote`. This guidance should help James successfully manage his Git submodules.
