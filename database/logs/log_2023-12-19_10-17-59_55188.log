In a previous conversation, James asked about funding bodies and opportunities for a faculty member in Offshore Energy focusing on critical minerals, carbon capture, offshore wind, marine spatial planning, and energy law. Arachne provided a list of potential funding sources, including the Department of Energy (DOE) for renewable energy and carbon management, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Interior (DOI) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) for marine spatial planning and offshore energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Department of Defense (DoD) for military applications, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for rural projects, foundations and nonprofits, international organizations, and private industry partnerships. Arachne advised James to review each program's specific areas of interest and eligibility requirements.
