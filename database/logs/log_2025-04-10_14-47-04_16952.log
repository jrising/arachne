In a prior discussion, James inquired about using `dplyr` to compute a new variable, `loss`, based on a formula involving the previous row's value. Initially, I provided a solution that utilized `mutate()` and `lag()`, but James rightly pointed out that `loss` had not yet been computed when attempting to reference it. I then clarified this issue and suggested a revised approach using `purrr` and `dplyr` to iterate over rows. This approach initialized the first row of `loss` without a prior reference and calculated subsequent values cumulatively, addressing the need for an initial value and maintaining the intended formula. The final code was shared to implement this solution effectively.
