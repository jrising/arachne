In the paper "Confronting the Environmental Kuznets Curve" by Dasgupta et al. (2002), the authors discuss how the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality is not fixed and can be influenced by various factors. They highlight the role of different parties such as citizens, businesses, policymakers, regulators, and NGOs in shaping this relationship. The authors emphasize the importance of environmental regulation in driving improvements in pollution levels, particularly in middle- and high-income countries. They provide examples of empirical studies that show the significant impact of regulation on reducing pollution and lowering the environmental cost of growth. The paper also discusses the role of economic liberalization in influencing pollution levels, but highlights the need for accompanying strengthened environmental regulation. The authors further highlight the pervasive role of informal regulation by low-income communities and market agents like multinational firms and consumers. The paper underscores the potential for developing societies to achieve improvements in environmental quality with robust environmental governance and regulation.
