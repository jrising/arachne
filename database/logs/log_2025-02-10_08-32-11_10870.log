James requested a way to shorten a statement detailing various regions in the UK and their projected damages by the end of the century. The original statement included specific percentages for energy supply and demand damages in London, labor productivity and health damages in the East Midlands, agricultural damages in the East of England, coastal damages in the South East, and livestock and fishery damages in Northern Ireland. I provided a more concise version that preserved the key information and regional details while reducing wordiness.
