James is teaching a class on Climate Change Economics and assigned a reading on "Uncertainty and Decision Making in Climate Change Economics" by Heal and Millner. Arachne provided multiple-choice questions based on the reading, covering topics such as the limitations of expected utility framework, uncertainties in climate economics, appropriate decision frameworks, sources of scientific uncertainty, and addressing policy decisions amidst climate change uncertainty. The questions aimed to reinforce key concepts from the reading and test understanding of critical issues in climate economics.
