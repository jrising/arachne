In this conversation, James sought suggestions for increasing enrollment in a newly established graduate program in Environmental Economics. The assistant provided strategies such as marketing and outreach, website optimization, online advertising, alumni stories, and webinars/open houses. James then requested a timeline for these activities, given limited time and capacity. The assistant offered a suggested timeline, divided into planning and development phases (June-July) and implementation and outreach phases (August-September), delegating tasks to faculty, communication personnel, and grad students. James further inquired about alternative tasks for grad students instead of alumni stories. The assistant proposed tasks such as current student testimonials and content development. James also sought advice on reaching out to relevant undergraduate programs, and the assistant suggested programs in mid-Atlantic region universities. A template response was provided summarizing the graduate program's description and inviting collaboration with undergraduate programs.
