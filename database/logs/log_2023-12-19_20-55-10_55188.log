James asked for suggestions for an anagram of a pun to end his handwritten addendum to his Christmas letter for a friend who loves puzzles and puns. Arachne provided four options: 1) "... and a year of 'No More Ups'!" (an anagram of "supermoon"), 2) "... and lots of 'Real Fun' ahead!" (an anagram of "funeral"), 3) "... and a year full of 'silent pug'!" (an anagram of "plunges it"), and 4) "... and a 'dear top' year!" (an anagram of "adore pet"). Arachne noted that these puns might need personal context to make sense and offered to provide more specific options if needed.
