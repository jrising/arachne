James inquired about how corporate giving towards climate and environmental causes might change with a new administration. I discussed factors like policy shifts, public perception of CSR, industry-specific implications, tax considerations, and risk management strategies. In response to his follow-up question about influential voices in corporate risk management and performance standards, I highlighted key figures such as Larry Fink from BlackRock, Paul Polman of Unilever, and Rick Fedrizzi of the US Green Building Council, along with organizations like the World Green Building Council and Architecture 2030. These leaders advocate for sustainable practices, emphasizing the integration of environmental concerns into business strategies and the building sector.
