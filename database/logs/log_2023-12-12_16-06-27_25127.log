In a previous conversation, James sought information about addressing a Japanese individual named "Tsugumi Yamashita" in the US academic system. Arachne explained that in Japan, it is customary to use the family name until a closer, more informal relationship is established. However, in the US academic system, it is common to address individuals by their first names regardless of their cultural background. Arachne suggested that "Tsugumi Yamashita" is likely to expect to be addressed by their first name, considering their experience in the US academic system. Nonetheless, it is important to respect individual preferences and ask or observe how they prefer to be addressed in order to create a positive and inclusive environment.
