James Rising is writing a case study on Bangladesh's long-term planning strategies for addressing climate risks, focusing on the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 as a means to secure aid and concessionary finance. He inquired about relevant divisions within the Ministry of Finance for interviews. I suggested engaging with the **Economic Relations Division** to discuss international funding and the **Finance Division** for budgeting insights. Notably, for specific units, I recommended the **Economic Policy Unit** for economic analysis and policy, and the **Public Financial Management (PFM) Unit** for budgeting practices. Both units could provide relevant insights into the fiscal aspects of climate planning.
