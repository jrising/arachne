Arqam Tariq is exploring a transfer from the PhD Public Policy program to the Environmental Economics (EE) program at the University of Delaware and inquired about funding availability. James Rising informed him that securing funding is essential before initiating the transfer and noted that Prof. Moffat, the EE Program Director, currently has no available funding. Arqam was advised to obtain an agreement from the Biden School regarding the transfer of his current funding. Steps to proceed include confirming a potential advisor, applying to the EE program, and finalizing the funding transfer after acceptance. James offered support and provided a Zoom link for further discussion.
