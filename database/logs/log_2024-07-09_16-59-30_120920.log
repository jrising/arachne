The conversation began with James requesting a love note for his husband, also named James, who was taking their two sons camping. I drafted a heartfelt note expressing love and appreciation for their adventure. Following that, James asked for a sponsorship document for an IMT joint event at HOK in Washington D.C. on October 16, specifying levels from $5,000 to $75,000 and including speech formats and project posters. I provided a structured sponsorship document outlining various sponsorship levels and associated benefits, ensuring to incorporate the speech format and display opportunities for project posters.
