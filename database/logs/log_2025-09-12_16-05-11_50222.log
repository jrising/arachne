James inquired about plotting data from a DataFrame in Julia using the Plots.jl package. The discussion included how to plot a line for the `mu` values with a half-transparent ribbon for confidence intervals (`ci25` and `ci75`). I provided a code example for this visual representation. He later asked how to limit the x-axis to the range from 2020 to 2100, to which I suggested using the `xlims` attribute. Subsequently, he wanted to label the y-axis as percentages, and I demonstrated how to customize the tick labels accordingly. Finally, he wanted to know how to save the plot as a PDF or PNG file, and I introduced the `savefig` function for that purpose, completing the guidance on generating and saving the plot.
