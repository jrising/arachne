James inquired about data on total produced (non-natural) capital by country. I suggested several sources for obtaining this information, including the World Bank's "Wealth Accounting" reports, OECD's wealth statistics, UN System of National Accounts guidelines, and IMF working papers. I also recommended checking national statistical offices for country-specific data. I emphasized the importance of noting variations in data granularity and methodology. I offered further assistance if he needed help accessing or understanding specific datasets.
