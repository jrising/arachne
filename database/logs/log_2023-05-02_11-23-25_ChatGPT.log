In IMPLAN, the "Total Final Demand" is the value of goods and services consumed within the study region, while "industry outputs" represent the total value of goods and services produced by each industry. The "Total Final Demand" can be less than the sum of industry outputs because not all goods and services produced are consumed locally. Some may be exported or not consumed at all. IMPLAN is a simplified model of complex economic systems and has limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results.
