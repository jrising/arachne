IMPLAN is an economic impact assessment software system that calculates economic multipliers and estimates the impact of changes in a local or regional economy. "Total Final Demand" in IMPLAN refers to the value of goods and services consumed within the study region, while "industry outputs" represent the total value of goods and services produced by each industry. The "Total Final Demand" may be less than the sum of industry outputs because not all goods and services produced within the region are consumed there. Some may be exported to other regions or countries, and some industries may have excess production that is not consumed. It's important to interpret the results of IMPLAN with care and understand the limitations of the models, as they are simplifications of complex economic systems.
