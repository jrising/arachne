James inquired whether knowing \( \text{Var}(y) \) and \( \text{Var}(y + \tilde{y}) \) could help calculate \( \text{Var}(\tilde{y}) \). I confirmed that if \( y \) and \( \tilde{y} \) are independent random variables, he can use the formula: 

\[
\text{Var}(y + \tilde{y}) = \text{Var}(y) + \text{Var}(\tilde{y})
\]

By rearranging the formula, he can solve for \( \text{Var}(\tilde{y}) \):

\[
\text{Var}(\tilde{y}) = \text{Var}(y + \tilde{y}) - \text{Var}(y)
\]

I also emphasized the importance of independence in this calculation, noting that additional information about covariance would be needed if they are not independent.
