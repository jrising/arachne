James inquired about organizing a list of functional fish groups categorized by size. I provided a structured organization by creating three main categories based on size: Large Fish (â‰¥90 cm), Medium Fish (30 - 89 cm), and Small Fish (<30 cm). Each category was further divided into specific functional groups such as Bathydemersals, Bathypelagics, Benthopelagics, Demersals, Pelagics, Reef-associated fish, Flatfishes, Rays, and Sharks. Additionally, I included a separate category for Small to Medium Fish (<90 cm). This hierarchy aimed to facilitate analysis and presentation of the data.
