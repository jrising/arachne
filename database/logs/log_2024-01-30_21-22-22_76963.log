In a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018) on offshore aquaculture siting in Delaware's ocean and bay, several issues and data requirements were identified. The issues include identifying suitable areas for aquaculture, identifying appropriate species, minimizing impacts from proposed projects, and understanding ocean health and anthropogenic impacts. The data requirements include information on jurisdictions, species abundance and distribution, oceanographic parameters, commercial fishing effort, vessel traffic, human and cultural use areas, bathymetry, sand and borrow sites, species and habitat locations, water quality, and geophysical data. The report highlights the existence of data gaps in these areas. Addressing these gaps would enhance the ocean and bay planning process and enable sustainable aquaculture practices in Delaware's marine waters. [Source: Dewberry Engineers (2018)]
