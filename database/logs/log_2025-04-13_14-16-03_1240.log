James inquired about the terminology for a scorpion's poisonous stinger, which I clarified is called a "telson." He then asked if there is a general term for such venomous structures, similar to how "fangs" refer to venomous teeth. I responded that the term "sting" applies broadly to barbs or stingers used to inject venom and that "venomous appendage" could also serve as a more general term for these structures.
