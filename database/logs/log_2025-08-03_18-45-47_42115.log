James asked for recommendations for kid-friendly movies about the stories of Thor. I suggested "Thor: Tales of Asgard" (2011), an animated film by Marvel Animation that presents a young Thor's adventures, making Norse mythology accessible for children. I also mentioned that "Thor" (2011), the live-action Marvel film, could be suitable for slightly older kids due to its action and comedic elements, although the animated version is a better fit for younger audiences. Both films serve as entertaining introductions to Thor's character and the broader themes of Norse mythology.
