James is writing a story about his ancestor meeting a talking mouse during the Great Stranger Migration. Arachne suggests incorporating Dutch speech patterns for the mouse character, Korporaal Boffens, including Dutch words, syntax, and directness. James seeks a subtler approach, leading Arachne to suggest integrating a few key words and structural quirks. In a further request to replace "Oh, dear man," Arachne proposes Dutch phrases like "Ach, goede vriend" for a cultural touch. The dialogue is refined to balance Dutch flair with readability, enhancing the character's authenticity while maintaining clarity for young readers.
