In the discussion, James sought to visualize GDP per capita growth rates in the UK for 2030 using ggplot. He provided three datasets: a probabilistic projection (Monte Carlo), SSP projections from two IAMs, and NGFS scenarios, asking for a command to display all three with proper grouping. I suggested using `ggplot2` and `cowplot` to create separate plots for the Monte Carlo data, SSP, and NGFS, followed by combining them into a single figure. James then requested a revision to combine the SSP and NGFS into a facet grid for a cleaner look. I proposed a new approach that involved facetting the SSP and NGFS data side by side while keeping the Monte Carlo plot separate, improving the visual comparison while adjusting themes for clarity.
