The user was having trouble getting webkitSpeechRecognition to stop after a reasonable pause when receiving audio. The assistant provided a solution using the `onresult` event and a timer. The assistant provided an example code snippet that sets up a timer to stop the recognition if no results are received after a specified duration. The assistant also explained how to send the recognized text to a service for processing. The user can adjust the silence duration to control when the recognition stops.
