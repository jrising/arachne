James asked if it is possible to calculate the entropy of a weighted pooling of distributions based on the entropy of each individual distribution. Arachne explained that calculating the entropy of a mixture distribution is not as simple as weighing the entropies of the individual distributions. The entropy of the mixture would not be a straightforward weighted average of the individual entropies because mixing random variables creates new uncertainty. Arachne provided a formula to calculate the entropy of a discrete, weighted mixture distribution and explained that it requires a full list of unique outcomes and their corresponding probabilities from the pooling of the distributions. For a continuous case, an analogous approach using the integral form of entropy should be used.
