James sought to calculate the average distance traveled from a large sparse matrix representing stochastic transitions. He shared his initial approach but noted performance issues and the loss of sparsity when extracting rows, which created dense vectors leading to slow calculations. I suggested optimizing by utilizing the `Matrix` package to maintain sparsity and pre-calculating distances only for non-zero entries. Upon further clarification, James pointed out that extracting rows still led to non-sparsity, prompting a revision to directly access non-zero values using the sparse matrix's `@x` and `@j` slots. This approach allowed for efficient distance calculations without converting to dense format, enhancing performance and maintaining the sparse structure.
