This conversation is a request from James to create a response to an email inquiry from Md. Emran Hosen, who is interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. James acknowledges Md. Emran's enthusiasm and mentions the alignment of his background and experience with the research area of Food Systems and Climate Change. James encourages Md. Emran to apply for the Ph.D. program, noting that funding is limited. He also suggests considering the new Environmental Science & Management program, which offers opportunities for interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. James provides contact information for Dr. Xinfeng Liang for more information on the natural science programs. The response is brief and encourages Md. Emran to apply in time for Fall admission to be considered for available funds.
