James received an email from Md. Emran Hosen expressing interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. Md. Emran's background in finance and interest in climate change research aligns well with James' work. James responds by acknowledging Md. Emran's enthusiasm and encouraging him to apply for the Ph.D. program while noting that funding is limited. James also suggests considering the Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track, which offers opportunities for interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. Lastly, James advises reaching out to Dr. Xinfeng Liang for more information on natural science programs within the Marine Science & Policy school.
