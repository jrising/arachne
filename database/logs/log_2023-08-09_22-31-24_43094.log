In this discussion, James seeks to understand two concepts related to uncertainty: epistemological uncertainty and ontological uncertainty. The assistant provides explanations for both terms. Epistemological uncertainty refers to uncertainty related to knowledge and understanding, highlighting limitations and gaps in our understanding of a subject. Ontological uncertainty, on the other hand, refers to uncertainty about the nature of reality itself, often arising when dealing with complex systems with conflicting perspectives. The assistant clarifies that uncertainty in decision-making can result from deep uncertainty, which arises from a fundamental disagreement regarding underlying assumptions, such as in the case of climate deniers.
