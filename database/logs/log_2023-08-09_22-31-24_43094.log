In the previous conversation, James asked about the type of uncertainty that arises from fundamental disagreements about climate science assumptions. The assistant explained that this type of uncertainty is called "deep uncertainty," which occurs when decision-makers cannot agree on the system model, probabilities, or value of alternative outcomes. James then inquired about epistemological and ontological uncertainty. The assistant clarified that epistemological uncertainty relates to the reliability and completeness of knowledge, data, or models, while ontological uncertainty is the uncertainty about the nature of reality itself. The conversation highlighted that both types of uncertainty stem from a lack of knowledge or understanding.
