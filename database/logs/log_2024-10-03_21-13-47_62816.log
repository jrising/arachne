James inquired about how to send emails to different recipients in Google Sheets based on specific responses to a question. I provided a step-by-step guide on using Google Apps Script, demonstrating how to set up a script to automate email sending based on response conditions. James then raised a concern that this script would send emails for every response, regardless of whether it was new. In response, I modified the original script by suggesting the addition of a "Processed" column to track which responses had generated emails. The revised script checks this column to prevent duplicate emails from being sent for previously processed responses, ensuring emails are only sent for new submissions.
