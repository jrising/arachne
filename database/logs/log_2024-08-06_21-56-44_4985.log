James sought assistance with displaying raster tiles in a Leaflet map within his R Shiny application. The discrepancy in tile numbering suggested a version mismatch in Leaflet libraries. The assistant recommended verifying tile generation with the mercator profile in GDAL and checking the URL template. Steps included manual verification, tweaking Shiny server structure, and potential cross-origin issues. When James encountered missing Leaflet JavaScript, the assistant advised explicitly loading Leaflet scripts, troubleshooting dependencies, and leveraging reactive observers. The synthesized approach emphasized ensuring Leaflet integration, inspecting for errors, and handling dynamic script loading to resolve the display issues in the Shiny app.
