James sought advice on how to respond to an expression of interest in his program amidst funding limitations. In response, I provided a framework for a polite and professional reply that acknowledges the individual's interest while clearly stating that there is no funding available this year. The suggested message includes compliments on the individualâ€™s strengths and encourages them to seek external opportunities. It concludes with an invitation to stay in touch, emphasizing a positive tone and maintaining a potential future connection. James was encouraged to modify the response to fit his own communication style.
