James requested a top 10 list of industry-specific terms to help locate decision-makers on LinkedIn for potential monetary donations, sponsorships, or membership in IMT programs. I provided him with terms such as "Sustainability Director," "CSR," and "Impact Investment," emphasizing their relevance to sustainability initiatives. He also asked for a one-line revision for a lead capture email subject line regarding a national nonprofit focused on improving buildings for communities. I suggested, "Transforming Buildings for People and Communities: Join Our Cause!"
