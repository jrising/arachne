Wave energy, the capture of energy from wind waves for useful work, has the potential to contribute to sustainability goals. While there is only one marine hydrokinetic lease and planning area in the US, located in Oregon, Delaware offers low potential wave energy levels but with potential low-level cost of usage. A UK-based company has developed the Waveline Magnet, which achieves a levelized cost of electricity as low as Â£0.01/kWh with minimal maintenance. Despite Delaware's modest wave energy potential, wave energies in some areas can reach above 7 kW/m, suggesting that even low potentials can be harnessed cost-effectively and sustainably. Wave energy holds promise as a renewable energy source for a greener future.
