The conversation centers around James's work as a computer programmer in a hedge fund focused on reinsurance, where he utilizes numerical analysis to assess expected losses from natural disasters. This expertise has led him to explore performance analysis of buildings and real-time tracking of power consumption. He is seeking advice on utility metering (AMI) and electronic data reading from ERT meters, detailing his interest in creating a consumer-friendly system similar to Sense.io, which maintains user data control. Challenges include limited granularity of readings and the transition to proprietary encrypted signals. To create such a system, I outlined steps involving understanding ERT communication, developing decoding software, disaggregating data into categories, creating a user interface, and iterative improvements based on testing and feedback.
