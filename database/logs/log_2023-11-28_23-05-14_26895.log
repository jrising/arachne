The project proposal aims to investigate how climate change can undermine human health through its impact on food production on land and in the ocean. The research plan is divided into five work packages. WP1 focuses on climate change and ecosystem services, led by Marek Ostrowski and Geir Ottersen. WP2, led by Oluwaseun Adeluyi, addresses agricultural production, while WP3, led by Erik Olsen, examines fishery production. WP4, led by James Rising, investigates nutrient supply and health impacts, and WP5, led by Kyle Davis, focuses on bioeconomic modeling and evaluation. The Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan is divided into three work packages. WP6, led by James Rising, involves tool and dataset development, while WP7, led by Gabriela Mundaca, focuses on developing the Food Security Futures Explorer. Finally, WP8, led by Nd√®ye Fatou Ndiaye, focuses on stakeholder engagement and dissemination. There may be a need to review and adjust the work packages to avoid gaps and overlaps.
