The user asked how to retrieve a numeric vector from a column in a data.table. The assistant provided an example code on how to use the indexing operator to subset the column and retrieve the vector. The user then asked about retrieving a column stored in a variable, and the assistant explained that using the `..` operator will return a data.table and suggested using the `unlist()` function to convert it to a numeric vector. The assistant provided another example code to demonstrate this. The user thanked the assistant for the help.
