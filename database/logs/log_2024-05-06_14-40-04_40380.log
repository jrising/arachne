James plans a comparative exercise on geoengineering techniques in a class. The AI suggests structuring the activity like a Bubble Sort algorithm. Students first compare techniques in groups, then winners from each group face off until a final ranking emerges. Emphasizing the importance of qualitative analysis, the AI advises James to encourage discussions on students' reasoning. To deepen learning, the AI suggests rerunning the exercise with different criteria to explore how it impacts decision-making.
