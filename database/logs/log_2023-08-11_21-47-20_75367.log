This conversation explores three maritime activities: shipping traffic, offshore wind energy development, and anchorage. Shipping traffic involves the movement of commercial vessels in Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs) and is subject to international rules. It has a spatial extent primarily within designated TSSs in the mid-Atlantic and at the mouth of the Delaware Bay. Analyzed data show seasonality in shipping traffic patterns. Offshore wind energy development is a proposed activity undergoing planning and project development. Wind energy installations are located in BOEM-designated wind energy lease blocks in the mid-Atlantic region. Spatial planning and the use of tools like AIS Data Handler help minimize conflicts with shipping. Anchorage refers to areas adjacent to TSS shipping lanes, possibly designated for ships waiting to enter or exit the Delaware Bay and River. Its current status is unofficial, but the USCG is considering official designation. Designating this area as an anchorage ground could impact other ocean usage plans, such as wind energy projects.
