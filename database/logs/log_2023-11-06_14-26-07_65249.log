The discussion revolved around a reading assigned to James's students, which detailed various aspects of climate change. Key points included the increase in global mean surface temperature, with a greater increase over land compared to the oceans, the "hiatus" period of slowed warming attributed to natural variability and potential underrepresentation of emissions in models, and projected temperature increases by 2080-2100. The reading also highlighted precipitation changes, humidity changes, impacts on tropical cyclones, sea-level rise, droughts and floods, cloud dynamics, ecosystem impacts, and tipping elements. It emphasized the role of economists in improving emissions forecasts, focusing research on economic and social questions, and collaborating with climate scientists.
