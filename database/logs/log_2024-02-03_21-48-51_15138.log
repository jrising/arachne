In a previous conversation, James had various queries related to web development using jQuery. These included topics such as querying string parsing in Flask, wrapping AJAX-returned HTML in a `<ul>` tag using jQuery, refreshing the jQuery UI menu without losing the active state, iterating over children in jQuery, removing items from jQuery children list, and adding and checking classes in jQuery. The conversation also addressed topics like handling multiple AJAX requests in JavaScript with jQuery, understanding jQuery's `.each()` method, and promise handling.
