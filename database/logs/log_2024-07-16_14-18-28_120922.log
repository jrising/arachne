James inquired about foundations and funders to support a $500,000 initiative aimed at enhancing climate-ready building projects through training for lenders and stakeholders. Key outcomes included developing core training for various groups, conducting community needs assessments, and ecosystem mapping in priority areas. I provided a list of potential donors, such as the Kresge Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, and Bloomberg Philanthropies, who focus on climate change mitigation and sustainability. Additionally, I mentioned insurance companies like Swiss Re and Allianz that contribute to climate resilience efforts. Overall, the discussion centered on identifying relevant financial support for sustainable building initiatives.
