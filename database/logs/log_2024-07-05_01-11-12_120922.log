In the discussion, James inquired about the differences between Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and ANOVA when applied to continuous variables. I explained that ANOVA is a classical statistical method assuming linearity, partitioning variance among categorical inputs, while GSA explores input-output relationships without strong assumptions, allowing for non-linearity. When James asked about GSA's lack of linearity assumptions and residual variance measures, I clarified that GSA evaluates outputs across entire input ranges, focusing on total output variability contributed by parameters rather than unexplained variance. Finally, James requested equations for typical GSA implementations, to which I provided formulas for calculating total sensitivity, first-order, and second-order sensitivity indices using Sobol' indices, emphasizing their relevance in assessing parameter importance and interactions in complex models.
