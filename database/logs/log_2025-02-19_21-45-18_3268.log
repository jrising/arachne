In a discussion about developing best practices for community engagement in marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) research, James outlined a capstone project supported by NOAA Research, emphasizing the importance of ethical and transparent community engagement in light of varying socio-economic and cultural contexts. I provided a selection of literature that highlights effective principles for engagement, including inclusivity, clarity of roles, and iterative processes. Subsequently, James requested a table to map specific contextual features—such as “fishing community” and “urban setting”—to engagement objectives and relevant principles. I initially struggled to align the references accurately with the contexts but revised the table to better reflect the papers discussed. Ultimately, the focus was on ensuring that the table would effectively serve as a resource for students' projects aimed at synthesizing best practices in community engagement for mCDR.
