This blog post discusses the role of individual tradable quotas (ITQs) in conserving Iceland's Atlantic Cod (IAC) populations. The study examines Iceland's ITQ system and analyzes the impact of an effort-based quota option on cod population dynamics. Using an agent-based model calibrated to the 1984 fishery, the research finds that the effort-based system contributed to the continued decline of the cod stock and suggests that strict ITQ regulation is necessary for recovery. The study highlights the potential distributional inequalities and impacts on smaller fishing operations associated with ITQs. The findings emphasize the need for alternative management strategies to promote equitable fisheries. Keywords include individual tradable quotas, fisheries management, overfishing, Atlantic Cod, effort-based quotas, agent-based model, total allowable catch, and distributional inequalities.
