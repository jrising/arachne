During the discussion, James asked about managing labels in QGIS, specifically related to maintaining label size at different zoom levels and exporting high-resolution images. Arachne provided a step-by-step guide on adjusting label scaling and exporting in QGIS. James then inquired about changing the background color of a layout in QGIS, and Arachne provided instructions. In response to James' query about changing the background color, Arachne clarified the steps to select the page itself in the layout to access the item properties.
