James inquired about preparing for an informational interview with S&P Global's newly established Climate Center of Excellence. I provided key insights, highlighting S&P Global's role in financial analytics and its commitment to integrating climate risks into the financial ecosystem. I emphasized understanding their sustainability goals and market trends in climate finance, while suggesting James reflect on his own skills and potential contributions to their mission. I advised him to prepare questions about specific projects and innovations, including the use of AI in climate analytics, to demonstrate genuine interest and align with their goals.
