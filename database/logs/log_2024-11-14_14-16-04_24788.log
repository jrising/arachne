In a previous conversation, James encountered an error using ggplot2 with `plot_layout()` in R, stating, "‘==’ only defined for equally-sized data frames." This happened while attempting to combine two plots (`a1` and `a`) with incompatible dimensions or properties. Despite simplifying the layout and checking individual plots, the error persisted. I provided troubleshooting steps, including ensuring themes and scales match, testing simplified versions of the plots, and confirming data compatibility. James clarified that the error occurs with just `a1 + a`, pointing toward the need for a better understanding of how to use `patchwork` effectively. I offered detailed insights into `patchwork`, emphasizing independent plots, aesthetic compatibility, and layout specifications while suggesting further debugging strategies.
