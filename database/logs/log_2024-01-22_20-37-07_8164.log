James is preparing a grant proposal on the consequences of climate change on food security and health. He sought advice on what to include in the section on "Consequences of Malnutrition on Health." Arachne provided a structured framework for the section, including an overview, discussing different forms of malnutrition, their impact on body systems and population health, vulnerable groups, socio-economic consequences, and highlighting the role of climate change. Arachne also suggested adding visuals, such as graphs or maps, and a synthesis table to summarize key information. The aim is to emphasize the gravity of the problem, establish the ripple effect on health, and support James' research with compelling evidence and references.
