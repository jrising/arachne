The discussion focused on finding the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) given q1, q2, q3, d1, d2, and d3. The equations were rearranged to express ECS in terms of the other variables. The relationship between the forcing response time (FRT), ECS, and transient climate response (TCR) in simple climate models was explored. The response time (or FRT) is related to the feedback factor (Î») in the one-box model. The warming halflife was discussed as a measure of how quickly the Earth's temperature responds to changes in radiative forcing.
