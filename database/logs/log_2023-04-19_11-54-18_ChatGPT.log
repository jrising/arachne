The discussion focused on calculating ECS given q1, q2, q3, d1, d2, and d3. The initial problem was solved by rearranging the equations, and the value of ECS was expressed in terms of q1, q2, q3, TCR/F2x, and the v1, v2, and v3 values. The unknown parameter F2x could not be directly eliminated. The relationship between ECS, TCR, and F2x was explained, providing a way to analyze how ECS changes with respect to TCR and F2x. The concept of FRT, or warming halflife, in a simple climate model was introduced, emphasizing its relationship to the response time and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The relationship between FRT, ECS, TCR, and the feedback factor (Î») in a one-box climate model was discussed, highlighting the inverse relationship between the response time and the feedback factor.
