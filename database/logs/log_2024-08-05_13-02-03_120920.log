In a recent conversation, James requested a program update memo for the Building Performance Partnership Webinar Series, aimed at raising $35,000 to fund programs across various hubs. The discussion highlighted that only the DC and IAG hubs were actively engaging in outreach, with a current sponsorship sign-on of approximately $15,000. The series features five educational programs promoting high-performance multifamily buildings and targets over 500 attendees across key cities. Emphasizing the need for broader participation in sponsorship efforts, I encouraged hub leaders from NYC, St. Louis, and Chicago to increase their outreach, pointing out the potential benefits for sponsors and the importance of collective engagement to meet funding goals.
