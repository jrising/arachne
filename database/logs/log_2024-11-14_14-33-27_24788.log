James shared an R script utilizing `ggplot2` and `patchwork` for data visualization, specifically plotting distributions and creating combined plots. He encountered an error when attempting to combine two plots (`a1` and `a`), which worked individually but produced an incompatibility issue when merged. The discussion highlighted the need to check data structures and ensure consistent aesthetic mappings. Further investigation revealed that `a1` used a large `data.table` with approximately 5 million rows, while `a` was a smaller `data.frame` with only 23 rows. Solutions involved summarizing the data for consistency and ensuring both plots were compatible before merging them with `patchwork`.
