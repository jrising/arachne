James inquired about a specific item on an Austrian menu: "Pumpkin vegetables with sheep cheese and potato bag." I interpreted this as a hearty vegetarian dish featuring pumpkin and possibly other vegetables, commonly prepared in Austrian cuisine. The "sheep cheese" indicates cheese made from sheep's milk, which is prevalent in Austria. The term "potato bag" was deemed confusing; I suggested it could refer to a baked or boiled potato dish, dumpling, or pastry filled with the cheese and pumpkin mixture. I emphasized that regional variations exist and advised asking the restaurant for clarification for a more accurate description.
