James sought to extract image URLs from a comic webpage efficiently. Initially using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing, he encountered issues due to dynamic loading, leading to a shift to `Selenium`. Wanting to avoid browser pop-ups, an alternative approach was proposed to determine the prominent image based on criteria. To check image sizes without saving to disk, he was advised to use `PIL` or `Pillow` with `requests`. Discussing image file sizes, James learned to approximate file sizes using HTTP response headers and how to proceed with image downloads after determining size.
