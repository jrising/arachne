James inquired about how Housing Upgrading Strategies (HUS) Architecture could collaborate with the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). I provided several potential collaboration avenues, including sustainable design initiatives, policy advocacy, education, community projects, and research. James emphasized his firm's focus on workforce engagement, technical analysis, equity, and systemic change rather than individual buildings. I suggested specific strategies such as joint policy advocacy and research, workforce training programs, and community engagement initiatives with the Building Performance Standards Coalition. Additionally, I mentioned exploring funding opportunities to support growth in these areas, aiming for a significant impact on climate action through systemic policy change.
