James inquired about the meaning of letters between clefs in piano sheet music, particularly noting a letter "C" and letters "C E G" below the bass clef. I clarified that the letter "C" signifies **common time** (4/4), indicating the measure's structure, while "C E G" denotes notes for a **chord or triad** that can accompany the melody. This visual shorthand helps pianists with harmonic structures without writing every note. I offered further assistance if he had a specific piece in mind.
