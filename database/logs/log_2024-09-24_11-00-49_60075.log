James inquired about replacing NAs with 0s in specific columns of an R data frame using dplyr. Arachne provided a detailed solution using `mutate()` and `across()` functions, demonstrating how to replace NAs with 0 in columns A and B of a sample data frame. The solution involved creating an anonymous function using the tilde symbol `~` to apply the `replace_na()` function to selected columns. Arachne emphasized the necessity of having the `tidyverse` package installed and loaded to use `replace_na()`. James was invited to ask for further clarification or assistance if needed.
