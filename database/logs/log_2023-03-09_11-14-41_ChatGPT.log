In this conversation, James asks how to make paper sticky with rubber cement. The assistant provides a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this, including applying the cement evenly, pressing the surfaces together, and allowing the glue to dry completely. James then asks about leaving the rubber cement to dry on only one surface, to which the assistant explains that the adhesive properties won't be activated and the surfaces won't stick together. In response to James' final question on creating a sticky ball or pad with rubber cement, the assistant outlines the process of pouring the cement onto a non-porous surface, shaping it into a ball or pad, and allowing it to dry. The assistant also notes the importance of following safety instructions and working in a well-ventilated area when using rubber cement.
