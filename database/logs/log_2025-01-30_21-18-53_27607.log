James Rising received an email from Yasir Hameed, a prospective PhD student from Pakistan, expressing his interest in pursuing a doctorate under James' supervision in fisheries, aquaculture, and marine biology. Yasir provided details of his academic background, including his master's research on dietary supplementation in fish and a bachelor's in Zoology. He requested a review of his CV and an acceptance letter to apply for a government scholarship. In response, James acknowledged Yasir's application and the details shared, but informed him that his research does not align with Yasir's interests. He advised looking for professors who specialize in fisheries and wished him success with his future endeavors, including the publication of his book chapter.
