In a conversation regarding an email from Bornali Mondal, a prospective Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Economics, James Rising addressed her follow-up inquiries about her application and desire to work under his supervision. Bornali expressed eagerness for feedback on her research paper and emphasized the importance of mentorship. James thanked her for her interest and explained that although he appreciated her initiative, he could not provide detailed feedback due to time constraints. He also communicated that he had no funding available for students this year, prompting a suggestion for Bornali to seek other supervisors or funding sources. He offered to discuss this further over a Zoom call, showcasing his professional and supportive approach within the academic context.
