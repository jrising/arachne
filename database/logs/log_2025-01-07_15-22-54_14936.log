In a previous conversation, James inquired about the longevity of most species and specifically hominid species. I explained that most species tend to last between 1 to 10 million years, with exceptions like the horseshoe crab (450 million years). For hominids, Homo habilis lasted about 1 million years, Homo erectus approximately 1.9 million years, Neanderthals around 400,000 years, and Homo sapiens continue today, emerging roughly 300,000 years ago. James expressed surprise over the overlap between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens, asking if we interbred or led to their extinction. I clarified that while they overlapped in time, there is no solid evidence of interbreeding, and their extinction was likely due to various factors including competition and environmental changes rather than direct conflict with humans.
