In the discussion, James Rising sought assistance in drafting a response to an email from Miriam Crispe, a prospective Master's student interested in Marine Policy and fisheries management at the University of Delaware. Key points from James included details about the transitioned Master's in Marine Policy to the new Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track, the availability of various Ph.D. and Master's programs, and the accompaniment of limited funding for the Ph.D. programs. He emphasized directing Miriam to fill out a form for prospective students to clarify their program options. A draft response was created, encouraging Miriam to mention James in her statement of purpose for a Ph.D. application, highlighting the importance of applying by December 1 for full consideration.
