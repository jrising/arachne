James requested a simple Linux batch script to run a program 10 times sequentially. I provided a Bash script template using a `for` loop to accomplish this task. The script included an example iteration message and instructions to replace `your_program_command_here` with the desired command. I also advised on making the script executable with `chmod` and running it from the terminal.
