In a discussion about Julia's file inclusion practices, James asked whether itâ€™s standard to set the working directory to the repository root or the script location. The consensus is that the working directory should be at the root for consistent referencing (e.g., `include("src/helper.jl")`). When James inquired about including further scripts, it was clarified that the path should still be relative to the root. He then encountered an error due to the changing working directory after an include. The conversation concluded with validating the need to maintain clear conventions, suggesting referencing files from the project root and introducing helper functions for modularity, despite the potential for changing paths during includes.
