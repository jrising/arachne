James inquired about extracting four-digit years from a string in R. I provided a solution utilizing regular expressions and the `stringr` package's `str_extract()` function. The method involved defining a pattern to match any four digits with word boundaries. This approach successfully extracted and printed the four-digit years from the input strings. I cautioned James to ensure that the strings did not contain other four-digit numbers that are not years to avoid incorrect extraction.
