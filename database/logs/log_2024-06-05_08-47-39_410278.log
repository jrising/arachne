The Building Innovation Hub targets neighborhood revitalization by promoting activities that stabilize or rejuvenate low- to moderate-income neighborhoods, disaster-designated areas, and regions with high poverty, unemployment, or population loss. The program also supports remote rural areas, aiming to stimulate economic and social development and foster sustainable growth and resilience within these communities. Through strategic initiatives, the Hub enhances local capacity, builds workforce skills, and provides essential resources to create a more equitable and sustainable environment.
