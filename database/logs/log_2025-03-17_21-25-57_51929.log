This discussion examines a PDF excerpt detailing the use of a Present Value cost calculator tied to the social cost of carbon in adaptation projects. Assuming $60 per ton for older projects and $75 for newer ones, it highlights data limitations, such as a small sample size concentrated in 12 countries, often excluding significant adaptation investments without donor support. Although the database is comprehensive, it notes incomplete assessments of the economic benefits of adaptation investments. Variability in analysis methods, definitions, and a lack of standardization contribute to these limitations. Nonetheless, the ongoing investments documented reveal valuable insights into recent adaptation efforts across twelve focus countries, necessitating further research for enhanced economic evaluation.
