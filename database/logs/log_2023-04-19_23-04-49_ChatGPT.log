James is designing a new language using the letters N, I, and O, along with derived letters, to represent different grammatical functions. The language uses compound words where the first letter provides the general concept and subsequent letters refine it. The last letter generally denotes whether the word is a noun, descriptor, or verb. Examples of words and simple sentences were provided, including emotions (love, hate, happiness), conjunctions (and, but), and prepositions (in, on). The provided examples demonstrate how to create words and sentences following the language's rules. However, it is noted that these examples may not perfectly capture James's intended meanings.
