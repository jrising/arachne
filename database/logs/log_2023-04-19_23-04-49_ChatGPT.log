James is designing a new language consisting of the letters N, I, and O, with derived letters and a compound word construction rule. The language has specific meanings for each letter and can be used to create nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Arachne provides examples of words and simple sentences in the new language and answers James's questions on creating emotion words and words for different grammatical functions.
