In a previous conversation, James asked for steps to break up a large LASSO analysis and combine the results using stacking or ensembling with the caret package. The process involves three steps. First, split the data into parts and train a LASSO model on each part using the glmnet and caret libraries. Second, use each LASSO model to make predictions for the complete dataset. Lastly, create a dataset of these predictions and train a second level model using the caret train function. The stacked model can then be used to predict with new data. The suggested solution is a simplified code, and specific details need to be addressed based on the individual case.
