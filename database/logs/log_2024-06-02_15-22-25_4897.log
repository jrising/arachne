James inquired about imposing a time-out on a function in Python, and I recommended using the `timeout_decorator` library. I provided a detailed example of how to implement a time-out for a function, including installing the library, using the `timeout` decorator, defining the function, and handling the `TimeoutError`. This method allows for controlling function execution time and handling cases where a function might run indefinitely.
