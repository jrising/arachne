James is writing a story set in Salem, MA, in 1657, where his ancestor, also named James, meets his future wife, Elizabeth, who is secretly a witch. He seeks a way to portray Elizabeth as an independent-minded woman during their first encounter, ideally with a rom-com twist. I suggest a scene where James, weary from travel, finds Elizabeth engaged in a lively argument at her fabric stall. Misunderstanding her playful remarks about 'self-weaving' fabric, he tries to correct her, leading to humorous exchanges that showcase her wit and strength. Through their interaction, Elizabeth's independence and charm capture Jamesâ€™s attention, laying the groundwork for romance while subtly hinting at her mystical abilities. This setup establishes both chemistry and tension, enriching the narrative.
