James asked if it's possible to edit a specific WordPress page in HTML without affecting other parts of the page. Arachne explained that it is indeed possible. She provided a step-by-step guide on how to do this using the WordPress editor. Arachne advised James to navigate to the "Pages" menu on the WordPress dashboard and select the desired page to edit. She then explained how to switch to the HTML version of a block on the editor and make the necessary changes. Arachne emphasized the importance of previewing the changes before saving and publishing the page. She also mentioned that if James wants to edit the HTML of the entire page or the theme's page templates, it would require more advanced coding and should be done by a web developer.
