During the conversation, James asked about the amount of unemployment benefits in Pennsylvania. I provided him with information on how the amount is determined based on earnings during a base period, and the maximum weekly benefit rates depending on the number of dependents. I also mentioned that these amounts are subject to change and advised James to check the official website of Pennsylvania's Department of Labor & Industry for the most up-to-date figures.
