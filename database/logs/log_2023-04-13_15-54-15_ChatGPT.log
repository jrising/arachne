The discussion focused on the projects and academic papers that attempt to comprehensively assess climate change risks and calculate welfare losses across all impacts and regions. The conversation highlighted projects like the IPCC Assessment Reports, United States National Climate Assessment, European Environment Agency, and academic papers using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to estimate climate change impacts and welfare losses. The limitations and challenges of achieving full comprehensiveness were also discussed, acknowledging the complexities and uncertainties involved in assessing climate change damages.
