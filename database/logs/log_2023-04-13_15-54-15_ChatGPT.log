In the discussion, James asked about projects and academic papers that have attempted to provide a comprehensive assessment of climate risks and calculate total welfare losses across all impacts. The assistant provided information on projects such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports, the United States National Climate Assessment (NCA), and the European Environment Agency (EEA) Climate Change Impacts in Europe report. The assistant also mentioned Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) like DICE, FUND, and PAGE, which estimate climate change impacts and welfare losses. When asked about academic papers, the assistant highlighted studies that assess welfare losses related to specific risks or sectors. James further inquired about expert elicitation and the damage function in the DICE model. The assistant provided information on studies that use expert elicitation for assessing economic costs and climate change impacts. Regarding the damage function in DICE, the assistant mentioned papers by William Nordhaus. James then questioned how economic researchers address the challenge of comprehensively assessing climate risks given the limitations of knowledge. The assistant explained that researchers use IAMs, scenario analysis, and expert elicitation to address these challenges. Finally, James asked if there are academic papers that use these methods for a plausibly comprehensive estimate of damages. The assistant suggested the Stern Review and a study by Hsiang et al. as examples. James expressed skepticism about the comprehensiveness of these papers, and the assistant acknowledged that while no single study claims full comprehensiveness, synthesizing insights from various studies can provide a more robust understanding of climate change damages.
