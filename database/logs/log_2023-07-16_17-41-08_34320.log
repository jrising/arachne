James, a Flask app developer, sought advice on implementing background processing in his app without setting up a full task queue system. The assistant suggested using the file system as a simple broker or opting for a lightweight task queue like RQ. The assistant outlined steps to implement the file system approach, involving writing input files, processing them in a separate background process, and storing results in a separate directory. However, this solution lacks conveniences provided by task queues and may have performance limitations. The assistant recommended considering Redis with RQ for better performance and additional task queue features. The assistant also emphasized the importance of handling concurrency issues and reading/writing errors.
