In this discussion, James is looking for a way to have his Flask app return immediately while processing continues in the background. Arachne suggests using a lightweight task queue like RQ or using the file system as the broker. Arachne provides a step-by-step solution involving writing input files, having a background process pick up and process these files, and using client-side JavaScript to check for the results. However, Arachne also mentions that this solution lacks the conveniences of more feature-filled task queues like RQ or Celery. Arachne advises considering a more robust solution if the application's needs are complex.
