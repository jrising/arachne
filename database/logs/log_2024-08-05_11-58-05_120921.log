James requested assistance in drafting a letter of intent (LOI) to invite funding for the "Community Climate Shift" (CCS) initiative, which aims to promote environmental and racial justice in underserved communities. The CCS initiative seeks to facilitate community-driven policymaking, improve building performance, and increase access to federal funding for clean energy. The discussion emphasized the urgent need to address inequities faced by BIPOC and low-income communities, who disproportionately experience the impacts of climate change. The proposed partnership aligns closely with the goals of "Invest in Our Future," which focuses on securing high-quality jobs and clean energy access. The drafted LOI outlined CCS's objectives, anticipated outcomes, and collaboration opportunities, aiming to secure financial backing for transformative community investments over the next decade.
