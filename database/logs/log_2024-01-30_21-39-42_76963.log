Based on the report by Dewberry Engineers (2018), the synopsis of the material highlights key data gaps relevant to Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. These gaps pertain to offshore renewable energy siting and leasing and have implications for activities such as commercial fishing, vessel transit, and marine habitats. The report emphasizes the need for better understanding and documentation of fishing areas impacted by proposed energy projects, as well as areas significant to vessel transit and geological hazard locations. Data requirements include detailed information on marine species abundance and distribution, commercial fishing effort through the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), human and cultural use areas, species and habitat locations, and oil and gas infrastructure. Addressing these data gaps would contribute to more comprehensive and sustainable planning in Delaware's ocean and bay. Reference: Dewberry Engineers (2018).
