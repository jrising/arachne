In our ongoing efforts to enhance marine spatial planning in Delaware, we have reviewed and updated the datasets used in Bates et al.'s (2012) report. Although we did not ask for datasets directly from Alison Bates, we have made significant progress in collecting updated information across physical, biological, and human activities in Delaware's marine waters. Our updated data includes information on traffic separation schemes, anchorage areas, sand borrow locations, submarine cables, cold-water corals, essential fish habitat, avian populations, shipping activities, commercial and recreational fishing, artificial reefs, and historic places. While there were challenges in collecting some datasets and errors encountered in retrieving data on marine mammals and sea turtles, we have made substantial improvements in providing current and relevant data for informed marine spatial planning.
