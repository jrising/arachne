In this conversation, James inquired about AI tools for literature reviews developed by Facebook and Meta. The AI tool specifically called "Galactica" was not found in either organization. However, various natural language processing (NLP) tools developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) that could be used for literature reviews were mentioned, such as RoBERTa and LASER. It was emphasized that while these tools can aid in the literature review process, a complete automation of literature review would be unlikely. No specific AI tool related to literature reviews developed by Meta was found.
