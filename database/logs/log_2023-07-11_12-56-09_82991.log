James asked for guidance on adding a basemap layer in QGIS, specifically one showing ocean bathymetry. The assistant provided step-by-step instructions on installing and using the QuickMapServices plugin in QGIS to add a basemap layer. The assistant also suggested using the GEBCO_2019 layer for ocean bathymetry or exploring NOAA Bathymetry services via a WMS link. The assistant emphasized the need to consider the appropriateness of each basemap layer for the specific context and to account for any uncertainties when drawing conclusions based on these layers.
