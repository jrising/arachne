In this conversation, James asked for guidance on adding a base map layer in QGIS that shows ocean bathymetry. The AI assistant recommended using the plugin QuickMapServices, providing a step-by-step explanation on how to install it and add a basemap layer. The assistant suggested using the GEBCO_2019 layer from the Contributed Pack as a good option for ocean bathymetry. They also mentioned the NOAA Bathymetry services as an alternative, accessible through a WMS link. The assistant emphasized the need for an internet connection to stream the basemaps and highlighted the importance of considering the appropriateness of each basemap in the specific context and handling inherent uncertainties when drawing conclusions based on them.
