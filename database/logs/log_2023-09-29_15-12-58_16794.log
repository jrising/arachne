In an effort to update and build upon the foundational work of Bates et al. in marine spatial planning in Delaware, our team undertook a thorough investigation to collect and update relevant datasets. We initially attempted to obtain data from Bates et al., but due to the challenges of transferring decade-old data, we decided to collect the information ourselves. Our efforts resulted in successful updates to various physical and biological datasets, including sediment, sand borrow locations, cold-water corals, essential fish habitat, and avian data. However, challenges were encountered with marine mammal and bat datasets, and some datasets, such as paleovalleys and wind resources, were not found. Despite these challenges, our comprehensive investigation has shed light on the complexities of spatial data acquisition and the dynamic nature of the data landscape.
