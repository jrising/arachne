James is crafting a story set in 1657 Salem, MA, where his ancestor, also named James, is about to meet his future wife, Elizabeth, who unbeknownst to him, is a witch. He aims to portray her as an independent-minded woman with a rom-com misunderstanding. I suggested a humorous scene in a bustling market where Elizabeth confidently confronts a vendor over a price dispute, seemingly commanding crows that surround her. This scene highlights her assertiveness and magical connection with animals while incorporating a playful moment when James stumbles due to his distraction, reinforcing her captivating presence. The interaction hints at the enchantment that will evolve in their relationship while establishing Elizabeth's strong character.
