James sought advice on using `mutate` and `reframe` in `dplyr` to calculate differences within groups. Initially considering `reframe`, he wanted to keep row numbers unchanged but discovered `mutate` resulted in all zeros. I explained that `mutate` applies operations by group but may not work as expected for non-element-wise operations like `diff`. I suggested using `group_modify` for such cases. James learned that for group-specific non-element-wise operations, like his `diff` calculation, using `group_modify` ensures the function is applied correctly within each group. He appreciated the clarification and was encouraged to ask for further assistance.
