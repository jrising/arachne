James inquired about potential Giving Tuesday campaigns for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). I suggested several ideas focused on energy efficiency and sustainability, including an Earth-Friendly Homes Awareness Drive, Green Building Certification Grant, Sustainability Scholarships, and an Energy Audit Sponsorship. James then expressed concerns regarding the disadvantages of Giving Tuesday, highlighting issues like donor fatigue, competing priorities, and resource intensity. I acknowledged these challenges and emphasized that IMT could instead engage the community through educational events, volunteer opportunities, or advocacy efforts, thus aligning actions with organizational values while still benefiting from the day.
