James requested a timeline for a Spring-Summer 2024 fundraising campaign plan, aimed at outlining planned activities for corporate, individual, and foundation fundraising. Key activities include presenting the plan at an April meeting in DC, leveraging board members for support, engaging with funders, and conducting staff education on reporting. The timeline was structured by month from April to July 2024, detailing tasks such as exit interviews, meetings with 7 new funders, cultivating corporate relationships, selecting events for IMT presence, and hosting donor engagement events. Key outcomes include establishing a stewardship calendar, coordinating board meetings, and ensuring staff bring back business cards from events for follow-up. Adjustments to the timeline may be necessary based on needs.
