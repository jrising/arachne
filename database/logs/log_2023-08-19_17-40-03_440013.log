In a discussion about expired Grey Poupon mustard, the assistant explains that while it may start to lose its flavor after the "best by" date, it doesn't become harmful. The shelf life of mustard past its best by date is approximately 1-2 years when properly stored. The assistant advises checking for signs of spoilage such as an off smell, a change in appearance, or mold, and to throw it out if any of these are observed. However, the best approach is to taste a small amount, and if it still has its typical flavor, it can still be used. The assistant also reminds the user that this information should not replace the advice of a medical or food safety professional, and when in doubt, it's best to throw it out.
