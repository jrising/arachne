Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki, a research assistant and MSc student in sustainable development, reached out to James Rising (School of Marine Science & Policy, UDel) for possible Ph.D. supervision in environmental economics. James responded by expressing delight at Abdulbaki's interest and highlighting the strong alignment between Abdulbaki's research areas and the program's focus on climate change adaptation, mitigation, sustainable development, and economic growth. James mentioned that the program is a good fit for non-traditional students and those with lighter quantitative backgrounds. He also acknowledged the limited funding available and advised Abdulbaki to apply early to be considered for any funds. James mentioned the transition of the Masters in Marine Policy program to the new Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program and clarified that the ESM program has limited funding and is largely self-funded. He suggested that if Abdulbaki is considering natural science programs, he could reach out to Xinfeng Liang. In conclusion, James warmly encouraged Abdulbaki to apply, expressing interest in having his application reviewed.
