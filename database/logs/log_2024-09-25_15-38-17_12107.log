James seeks to make his QNAP NAS writable on his Linux server via NFS, encountering read-only issues. Arachne advises configuring NFS settings on the QNAP, adjusting permissions, and checking user/group IDs between systems. Subsequently, James faces a disabled "Edit Shared Folder Permission" button, prompting suggestions like verifying user privileges, checking for storage pool issues, and updating firmware. Arachne guides James on aligning user/group IDs, providing steps to compare, adjust, and ensure matching IDs for successful NFS access. James is encouraged to remount the NFS share after making changes.
