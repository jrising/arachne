James inquired about how to transfer a commit from the `master` branch to a new branch in a Git repository, asking for guidance on keeping `master` aligned with a previous commit. I provided a step-by-step process: creating a new branch, resetting `master` to the previous commit, and force pushing changes if necessary. James then observed that a distinct log item labeled "Force Push" appeared on `master` after executing this operation, expecting the old commit to disappear from the log. I explained that the "Force Push" entry indicates a rewritten commit history, which Git retains for tracking changes and preventing data loss, and emphasized that the old commit remains in the repository until garbage collected.
