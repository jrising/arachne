James sought clarification on interpreting coefficients from a Poisson regression model generated by `depmix`. The AI explained that the coefficients are log-transformed due to the multiplicative nature of the Poisson distribution, allowing for proportional changes in counts with predictor variables. A negative coefficient indicates a decrease in the expected count, with the magnitude determining the percentage decrease. Thus, despite the initial complexity, understanding the log link and multiplicative model nature clarifies the intuitive interpretation of coefficients in the Poisson regression context.
