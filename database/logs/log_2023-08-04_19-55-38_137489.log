In a discussion about the concept of "primes" in ancient Greek society, the assistant clarifies that while the Greeks didn't have a specific concept of multiple "primes" as understood today, they did recognize different valuable life stages such as youth, adulthood, and old age. These stages were associated with different qualities and were appreciated for their unique contributions. The assistant suggests that the poet's reference to Theseus as a "youth in his first prime" is more of a poetic way to highlight his impressive accomplishments at a young age. Overall, while not explicitly termed "primes," the Greeks had an understanding of the value and distinctiveness of each life stage.
