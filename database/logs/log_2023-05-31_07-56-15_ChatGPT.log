In a previous conversation, James asked for the best app or website for finding restaurants in Portugal while traveling. In response, I provided a list of commonly used platforms as of September 2021, including TripAdvisor, Zomato, TheFork, and Google Maps. I mentioned that Google Maps is widely used in Portugal. However, I advised James to check the current availability and popularity of these platforms in 2023 and to consider asking locals for recommendations upon arrival.
