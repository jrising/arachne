James is developing a smart form for prospective applicants to the University of Delaware's environmental policy programs. The conversation involves creating structured questions to guide candidates based on their interests and qualifications. A preliminary question was drafted to identify applicantsâ€™ academic interests in social science, natural science, or interdisciplinary fields. Following this, a questionnaire about quantitative backgrounds was proposed, allowing candidates to specify their experience with microeconomics, calculus, statistics, and programming in a multiple-choice grid format. An intermediate question was added to gauge interest in quantitative work, with explanatory text clarifying the importance of this information for program alignment. The aim is to effectively funnel candidates to suitable programs while minimizing administrative workload.
