James is experiencing issues with his MediaWiki upgrade where all pages show up as "There is currently no text in this page" even though the content is still present in the `content` table. The SQL query he provided suggests that the issue may be related to the `rev_comment_id` field and the join with the `comment` table. This could be a result of schema changes in MediaWiki, specifically in version 1.30, where the `rev_comment` field was replaced by a reference to the `comment` table. To troubleshoot, I suggested running a modified SQL query excluding the join with the `comment` table, and also checking the maintenance script `updateCommentTable.php` for comment migration. I emphasized the importance of performing a database backup before attempting any modifications. More information about the upgrade process and error messages would be helpful in resolving the issue.
