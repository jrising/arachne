In a conversation about archiving a GitHub project on Zenodo, James sought guidance on whether he could archive code from a repository owned by his collaborator. I explained that only the repository owner can integrate GitHub with Zenodo. I outlined the steps for his collaborator, including creating accounts on both platforms, activating the GitHub-Zenodo integration, selecting the repository, creating a release on GitHub, and how Zenodo will automatically archive it to generate a DOI. I suggested that she could also add James as a collaborator in Zenodo for easier access and management.
