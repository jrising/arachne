This conversation covered various topics related to economics and climate change. It started with a discussion on the economic risks of climate change, including physical risks, transition risks, liability risks, and financial risks. The conversation then moved on to defining economic welfare and the different approaches used by economists to measure it. The distinction between risk and uncertainty was also explained, with risk referring to situations where probabilities can be estimated and uncertainty referring to situations where probabilities are unknown. Finally, the conversation discussed Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, explaining that they are macroeconomic models used to simulate the effects of policy changes or shocks on the overall economy.
