This conversation covered various topics related to economics and climate change. The economic risks of climate change were discussed, including physical risks, transition risks, liability risks, and financial risks. The concept of economic welfare was defined as the level of well-being or satisfaction derived from the consumption of goods and services, with two main approaches based on income/wealth and utility. The difference between risk and uncertainty was explained, with risk involving known or estimable probabilities and uncertainty involving unknown probabilities. Finally, it was confirmed that CGE models are macroeconomic models used to analyze the interactions between different sectors and simulate the effects of policy changes or shocks on the economy.
