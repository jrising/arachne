The conversation started with James asking for terms to describe the walk of a monster approaching someone. I provided a list of terms such as "lumbering," "stamping," "lurching," "trudging," and "stalking," among others, to convey the menacing qualities of a monster's walk. These terms emphasize the heavy, slow, and calculated movements of the monster, as well as its predatory nature or relentless approach. I also suggested incorporating the overall physicality, intent, and atmosphere of the scene when selecting a term. The discussion concluded with the presentation of various options for James to choose from when describing the monster's walk.
