In a previous conversation, James asked about the resolution of the NOAA Fisheries' MRIP Query Tool and what "wave-level" catch and effort data means. Arachne explained that the MRIP Query Tool provides data at the level of individual trips or fishing events, with varying resolution depending on the available data. Arachne also clarified that "wave-level" data refers to a two-month interval, with six waves in a year. The update about "wave-level" data means that NOAA plans to provide MRIP data at this more granular temporal scale, allowing for more precise analysis of temporal patterns in marine recreational fishing activity.
