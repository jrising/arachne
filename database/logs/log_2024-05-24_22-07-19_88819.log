James inquired about obtaining the current datetime in the format "Fri, 24 May 2024 20:36:16 +0000" using Python. The assistant provided two methods to achieve this: using Python's `datetime` and `email.utils` modules, and a manual approach involving `strftime`. Both methods would output the current datetime in the specified format, allowing James to choose the most suitable option for his needs.
