In the previous conversation, James asked how to relabel the axes of a raster from -180 to 180 to 0 to 360. The assistant provided code examples in both R and Python using the `raster` package and `rasterio` library, respectively. The code shifted the raster horizontally by 180 degrees and adjusted the extent to be between 0 and 360. The assistant also cautioned that shifting a global raster in this way could introduce inaccuracies at the dateline. Depending on the application, it may be better to work with coordinates from -180 to 180 instead of shifting them.
