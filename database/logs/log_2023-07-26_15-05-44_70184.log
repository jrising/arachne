James asked how to relabel the axes of a raster from -180 to 180 to 0 to 360. The assistant provided code examples in R and Python using the `raster` and `rasterio` packages, respectively, for shifting the raster and updating the extent or transform metadata. The assistant also mentioned that shifting a global raster might introduce inaccuracies at the dateline.
