James expressed a desire to find an alternative environmental protest song to "Before the Deluge," which felt too fatalistic for him and his kids. I suggested "Big Yellow Taxi" by Joni Mitchell as a more hopeful anthem but noted it might not suit his bedtime routine since he lacks instrumental accompaniment. In response, I recommended "Blackbird" by The Beatles for its soothing melody and themes of hope. After his request for more options, I provided additional suggestions, including "The Garden Song" by Pete Seeger, "Singing in the Rain," "Pure Imagination," "Down to the River to Pray," and "Give a Little Bit" by Supertramp, all of which feature positive messages and gentle melodies suitable for bedtime singing.
