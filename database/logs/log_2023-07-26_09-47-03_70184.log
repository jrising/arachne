James encountered an error while writing a shapefile due to an orphaned hole, which was resolved by checking and correcting the geometry using the `gIsValid()` and `gBuffer()` functions from the `rgeos` package. This led to a new issue where the object was converted to a `SpatialPolygons` instead of a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`. The solution involved converting the `SpatialPolygons` object back to a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` by assigning attribute data to it.
