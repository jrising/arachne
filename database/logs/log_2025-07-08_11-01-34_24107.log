In a previous conversation, James sought assistance in formatting a string of authors listed with last names first and separated by semicolons into specified citation styles. I provided a Python function that splits the authors, counts them, and formats the output as follows: one author returns just their name, two authors return with an "&" symbol, and more than two authors return with "et al." Additionally, the function handles edge cases for institutions. Example inputs were tested, confirming the function's effectiveness. I also offered to customize the function further if needed.
