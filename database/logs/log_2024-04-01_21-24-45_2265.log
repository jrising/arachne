James sought advice on a camping trip with his son near Philadelphia. I suggested three ideal locations: the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania for lakes, streams, and forests; Ricketts Glen State Park for waterfalls and fishing; and Shenandoah National Park in Virginia for immersive nature experiences. I emphasized checking for permits and regulations before embarking on the trip.
