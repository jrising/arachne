James encountered a Subversion commit error due to a missing repository path `/home/jrising/svn`, which didn't match his working copy's actual repository location. After understanding that `/home/jrising/svn` referred to the server's repository, steps were shared to address permissions and potential corruption concerns without deleting critical files. Permissions on the repository's `db` directory were checked, suggesting appropriate settings, but the focus shifted to user permissions during commits and potential locks causing the issue. Further actions included verifying user permissions, removing stale locks, and consulting with a repository administrator if problems persist.
