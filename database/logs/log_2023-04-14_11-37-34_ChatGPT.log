In the previous conversation, James asked about the name for the length of a circle that is part of a wedge. I informed him that the length of the circle that forms the boundary of the wedge is called an arc. He then asked if there is a specific name for the length of an arc. I confirmed that the length of an arc is called its arc length, which is measured in units such as centimeters, meters, or feet. I provided James with the formula for calculating arc length, which involves the central angle of the arc in degrees, the radius of the circle, and the circumference of the circle.
