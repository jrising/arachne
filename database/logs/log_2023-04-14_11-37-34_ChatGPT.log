The discussion centered around the concept of arc length, which refers to the length of a curved portion of a circle. The assistant provided a definition of arc length and explained how it can be calculated using the formula Arc Length = (θ/360) × 2πr, where θ is the central angle of the arc in degrees and r is the radius of the circle.
