In a test of the memory system, James asked the AI if it remembered a conversation about the Little Mermaid's sisters. The AI confirmed it remembered the conversation, providing details of the names of the sisters in the Disney film adaptation. James then asked about conversations regarding Lenfest, and the AI recalled a conversation about Lenfest grants and user-defined exceptions, offering an explanation of user-defined exceptions in Python programming and suggesting guidelines for Zoom interview titles. The AI encouraged James to provide more specific questions or continue the conversation about Lenfest grants if desired.
