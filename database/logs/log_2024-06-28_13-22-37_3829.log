James inquired about the energy contributions in fossil fuel combustion, specifically focusing on C-H bond breaking and the strength of resulting CO₂ and H₂O bonds. The response detailed the energy dynamics, emphasizing that the majority of energy released is from forming strong bonds in CO₂ and H₂O, outweighing the energy needed to break initial C-H bonds. The net energy released from combustion supports the potency of fossil fuels as an energy source but also highlights their role in greenhouse gas emissions, urging consideration for sustainable alternatives.
