Both Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021) highlight significant data gaps in understanding "Species and Habitat Locations, Including Benthic Habitat" for Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. The reports emphasize the importance of detailed and improved habitat maps to support a range of activities, including aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience and climate adaptation, sand and sediment management, species and habitat management, water quality, offshore renewable energy siting and development, and marine recreation. The authors call for better data on impacts of activities such as aquaculture, fisheries, invasive species management, and climate change responses. Trice et al. (2021) also stress the need for standardized datasets and methodologies to interpret bathymetry data and derive habitat information. Addressing these data gaps would enhance Delaware's spatial planning process, improving fisheries management, climate change adaptation, species conservation, and optimal site selection for various activities.
