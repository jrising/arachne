In a discussion about enhancing a strategic plan, James requested a detailed timeline and structure to gather insights and engage stakeholders effectively. The plan outlined a phased approach starting with internal questions (Weeks 1-4), forming a subcommittee (Weeks 5-8), and then engaging outside experts (Weeks 9-12). Additionally, a competition framework for the Business Engagement Team was developed, comprising four phases over six weeks: team leaders submit business cases (Phase 1), receive expert feedback (Phase 2), present their cases (Phase 3), and undergo evaluation for awards (Phase 4). The evaluation criteria focus on understanding business needs, innovation, practicality, alignment with sustainability goals, and presentation quality. The competition aims to crystallize a winning business case to attract future investments and members.
