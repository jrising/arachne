James inquired about how to look for mountable drives on Ubuntu. The assistant provided six methods to locate mountable drives, including using commands like `lsblk`, `fdisk`, `blkid`, `df`, and `cat /proc/partitions` in the terminal, as well as using the graphical tool GParted. Each method offers a unique way to display information about available drives and their partitions, catering to different user preferences for command-line or graphical interfaces.
