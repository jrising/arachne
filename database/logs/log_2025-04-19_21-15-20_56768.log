The discussion centered on the consistent directional movement of tectonic plates and the complexities involved in visualizing mantle convection. James initially inquired why tectonic plates don't move randomly during earthquakes. I explained the driving forces behind their predictable movement: mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push, emphasizing that earthquakes release stress without altering long-term plate movements. He then expressed curiosity about the lack of detailed maps of mantle convection flows, noting potential influences like the Coriolis effect. I outlined several factors for this, including the complexity of mantle dynamics, data limitations, scale issues, and visualization constraints. While models provide insights into these processes, capturing detailed flow patterns remains challenging, though advancements may improve visualizations in the future.
