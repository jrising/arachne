James requested assistance with formatting a paper title to title case. He provided the original title: "UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON: A MODELDIAGNOSTIC AND INTER-COMPARISON STUDY." I converted it into title case, resulting in "Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon: A Model Diagnostic and Inter-Comparison Study."
