In a previous conversation, James inquired about the designation of scenarios used by the IPCC. I explained that the current framework consists of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)—five distinct scenarios ranging from sustainability to fossil-fuel-dependent development—assessed alongside Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which detail greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. James then asked whether to refer to these as AR6 or CMIP6 scenarios. I clarified that AR6 refers to the latest IPCC report, while CMIP6 pertains to the climate model scenarios utilized in the AR6 analyses. Thus, AR6 denotes the overall report and findings, whereas CMIP6 specifically pertains to the model outputs contributing to those findings.
