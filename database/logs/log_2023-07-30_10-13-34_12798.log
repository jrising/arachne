In this conversation, Austin (age 3) shares his interests with the assistant, including Sesame Street, dragons, pirates, and fighting with swords. He asks how yogurt is made. The assistant engages Austin's interests by comparing yogurt-making to a cooking experiment, a wizard or princess making a potion. The assistant explains that yogurt is made using milk and friendly bacteria called Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. The process involves heating the milk, cooling it down, adding the yogurt buddies, and letting them rest for 6 to 12 hours. The bacteria eat the sugars in the milk, producing lactic acid, which thickens and tangifies the milk into yogurt. The assistant encourages Austin to make yogurt with adult supervision and highlights the importance of bacteria for our bodies, comparing them to helpful characters from Austin's favorite shows.
