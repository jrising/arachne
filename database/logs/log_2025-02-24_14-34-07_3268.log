James inquired about whether any species of Elasmobranchii engage in "homing" behavior, specifically regarding their return to spawning sites. In response, it was highlighted that certain Elasmobranchii species, such as the lemon shark (*Negaprion brevirostris*), do exhibit homing behavior, returning to specific nursery areas for reproduction. This ability is significant for maintaining population structures and ensuring successful reproduction, indicating advanced navigation skills that likely rely on environmental cues like magnetic fields, water chemistry, and acoustic signals.
