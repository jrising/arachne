This log entry is a discussion between James and Arachne about the difference between `\SI` and `\si` in the `siunitx` package for LaTeX. Arachne explains that `\SI` is used to include a number with a unit, while `\si` is used to print just the unit. James then asks how to report units of square kilometers (`km^2`) using `siunitx`. Arachne provides the command `\si{\kilo\meter\squared}` as the recommended way to report square kilometers, but acknowledges that using "km^2" or "km$^2$" is also acceptable in many cases. Arachne emphasizes that using `siunitx` ensures consistency and readability in scientific or technical documents, while the choice ultimately depends on the specific needs and preferences of the audience.
