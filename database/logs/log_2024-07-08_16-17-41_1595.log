James inquired about generating a list of all hours between two dates in Julia. I provided a detailed guide using the `DateTime` and `Dates` modules to achieve this. The steps included importing the necessary modules, defining start and end dates, generating the sequence of hours, and converting to a `Vector{DateTime}` if required. The code provided allows for customization of the start and end dates, producing a list of hourly `DateTime` entries.
