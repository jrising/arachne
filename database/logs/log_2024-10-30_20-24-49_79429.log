The conversation centered on responding to an email from Abdullah Al Maruf, a prospective student interested in James Rising's research. James was to clarify program options, noting the transition of the Marine Policy Master's to an Environmental Science & Management program with a marine track. He outlined potential pathways such as the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics as the preferred choice and provided details about funding limitations. James aimed to identify any specific questions or confusions in the email before drafting a response that directed Abdullah to a program identification form. The final response encouraged Abdullah to apply and mention James in his Ph.D. statement of purpose, while emphasizing the December 1 application deadline for full consideration.
