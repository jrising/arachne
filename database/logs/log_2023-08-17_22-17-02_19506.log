The discussion focused on the current state of marine protection in Delaware waters. Three sources of data, including Coral Protection Areas, FWS NWRS Marine Protected Areas Parcels, and Protected Areas from ProtectedPlanet, were examined. It was found that while there are existing protective measures in place, such as the Coral Protection Areas and the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve, there is still significant untapped potential for marine protection in the area. The absence of Marine National Monuments or National Marine Sanctuaries was also noted, despite the area's historical and ecological importance.
