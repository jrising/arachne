Delaware marine waters currently have protective measures in place, such as Coral Protection Areas, which aim to safeguard deep-sea coral from fishing gear. However, the area lacks Marine National Monuments or National Marine Sanctuaries despite its historical and ecological importance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges provide protection, but no land is exclusively dedicated to marine protection. The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is the only substantial water-body reserve, but it lacks a no-take zone. The untapped potential for marine protection in Delaware's waters is significant, and a more balanced and diversified conservation approach is needed, incorporating both reserves and sustainable use policies.
