To create a pandas DataFrame from a collection of vectors of the same length, import the pandas library, create a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are the vectors, and then pass the dictionary to the DataFrame constructor. Each vector will correspond to a column in the resulting DataFrame, with its name taken from the dictionary's keys. It is important that all vectors have the same length, as each element corresponds to a row in the DataFrame.
