In the conversation, James inquired whether the symbol of a cobra was viewed positively or negatively by ancient Egyptians. I clarified that the cobra was generally a powerful and positive symbol, associated with the goddess Wadjet, protection, royalty, and divine authority. Cobras were frequently featured in pharaonic crowns and symbolized rebirth due to their skin-shedding behavior. The discussion also touched on an incomplete message from James, in which he wrote "5," prompting me to ask for clarification.
