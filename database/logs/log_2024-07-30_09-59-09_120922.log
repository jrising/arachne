James inquired about mounting his QNAP NAS on a Linux box, initially facing a read-only issue in `/mnt/qnap_shares`. I provided steps for creating a writable mount, including details on installing `nfs-common`, modifying `/etc/fstab`, and ensuring proper permissions on the NAS. James later asked how to find his QNAP's IP address, confirming it as `10.2.74.57`. He encountered installation issues with `nfs-common` due to a typo, which I corrected. However, he faced a "Protocol not supported" error, prompting me to suggest specifying the NFS version in `/etc/fstab`. Finally, he received an "access denied" error while mounting the share, leading to a discussion about adjusting NFS share permissions on the QNAP NAS to allow access from his Linux client.
