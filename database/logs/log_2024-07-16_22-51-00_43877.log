James participated in a zoom interview discussing coastal risks and resilience in Fenwick, Delaware. As mayor, he highlighted the town's historical resilience to coastal flooding but noted an increase in flood events, including "sunny day events." The impacts are primarily on the bayside community due to tidal surges and heavy rain, exacerbated by a rainwater management system draining into the bay. Concerns include safe access to homes, with the bayside facing the highest flooding risk. The town features efficient dune systems, and James emphasized the need for adaptation and preparedness in the face of escalating coastal challenges.
