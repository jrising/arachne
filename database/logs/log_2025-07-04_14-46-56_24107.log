In a discussion on extracting a YAML dictionary from a string using Python, James sought a solution for identifying the dictionary formatted as `"Category": "Extracted Information"` within a text. I provided an initial approach using regular expressions, but James encountered a `re.PatternError` due to the use of variable-width look-behinds. I then revised the solution by simplifying the regex, eliminating look-behind assertions, and suggested using `re.findall()` to extract key-value pairs more effectively. The updated code captures valid lines and constructs a dictionary that can be easily accessed, aimed at addressing the original error and fulfilling James's requirement.
