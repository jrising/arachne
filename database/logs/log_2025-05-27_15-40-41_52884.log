In a previous discussion on Jan 18, 2025, James inquired about iterating through JSON objects stored in a JSONL file using Python. I provided a solution that demonstrates reading the file line by line and parsing each line as a JSON object using the `json` module. The example code I shared shows how to open a JSONL file, iterate over its lines, and process each JSON object. I emphasized the importance of ensuring proper formatting in the JSONL file and offered to assist further if needed.
