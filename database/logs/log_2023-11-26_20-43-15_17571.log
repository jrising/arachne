In a previous conversation, James asked if there was a way to approximate the relationship p = (1 - (1 - A)^X) when A << 1. Arachne explained that when A is much smaller than 1, we can use the approximation (1 - A)^X â‰ˆ 1 - XA, which is derived from the first two terms of the binomial expansion. This approximation is valid when A is much smaller than 1 and when XA is also small. Consequently, p can be approximated to XA. Therefore, under the assumption that A is much less than 1 and XA is also small, p is approximately equal to XA.
