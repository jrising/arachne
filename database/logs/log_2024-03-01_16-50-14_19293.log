James asked about transferring a corrupted subversion repository from his local machine to a new server repository. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions for dumping the repository locally, transferring it to the server, and loading it into the new repository. Arachne emphasized the importance of backing up data and updating the local working copy to point to the new server repository URL using the 'svn switch' command. The process required `svnadmin` rights and careful execution to successfully replicate the repository on the server.
