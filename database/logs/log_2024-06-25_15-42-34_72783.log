James is exploring the implications of PFAS-based membrane technology for hydrogen production on vulnerable groups. Arachne outlined key groups like low-income communities, workers, indigenous and minority groups, and highlighted potential impacts such as health risks, economic shifts, and environmental justice issues. Strategies for mitigation include regulatory safeguards, community engagement, economic support programs, and health monitoring. By considering these groups and strategies, James can work towards a more equitable transition to PFAS-based membrane technology, ensuring minimal impact on vulnerable populations.
