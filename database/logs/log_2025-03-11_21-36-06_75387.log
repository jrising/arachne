James inquired about shifting `geom_point` in `ggplot` by a specific vertical displacement. I provided a method for continuous dimensions by altering the y aesthetic. James clarified that he needed a solution for a discrete dimension. I then recommended using `aes()` to add vertical displacement for discrete categories and provided an example using a factor for category on the x-axis. Additionally, I suggested using `position_dodge()` to avoid overlapping points while displaying both original and displaced points. This approach helped visualize the adjustment clearly in the plot.
