James sought a concise revision of a paragraph from his grant proposal on climate change impacts on fisheries and marine ecosystems. The edited version highlights how climate change affects ocean parameters, leading to changes in species composition, phenology, geographic distributions, and stock productivity. It also emphasizes the potential consequences such as limited fisherman access, global marine biomass loss, and declining landings by the 21st century, with significant implications for people dependent on fisheries for sustenance and income, impacting the global economy.
