In a conversation on January 31, 2024, James inquired about flipping a ggplot so that the x-axis appears at the top, essentially inverting the plot vertically. I explained that while there isn't a direct ggplot function to achieve this, a workaround involves using `coord_flip()` to swap the axes and `scale_x_reverse()` to reverse the x-axis direction. I provided a sample R code demonstrating how to implement these changes and adjust axis titles, text, and ticks. The resulting plot features swapped axes and the x-axis running across the top, along with customized theme settings for a clean aesthetic.
