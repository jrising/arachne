The AI explained that it is typically mold or mildew caused by the warm, moist environment inside bath toys. James then asked for strategies to avoid getting the gunk. The AI suggested drying out the toys after each use, storing them in a dry place, regular cleaning with soap or bleach solutions, sealing holes, and replacing toys regularly.
