James asked how to iterate over the children of a jQuery object in jQuery. Arachne explained that he can use the `.children()` method to get the immediate child elements of the jQuery object and the `.each()` method to iterate over them. She provided an example code snippet using `$ul` as the jQuery object. Arachne also pointed out that if James wants to target specific child elements, he can provide a selector to the `.children()` method.
