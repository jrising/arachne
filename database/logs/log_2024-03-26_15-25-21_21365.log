James inquired about stopping `pandas`' `read_csv` at the first error while still returning correctly read rows. I explained that the method does not halt at the first error but suggested a workaround of reading the CSV file line by line with error handling to retain the already processed data. I provided a sample code snippet demonstrating this approach, allowing for the capture of valid rows even if an error occurs.
