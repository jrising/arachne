In a previous conversation, James asked for a suggestion on a meeting place between Philadelphia and Saugerties, NY, that would be enjoyable for both their kids and his pregnant friend. Arachne recommended Allentown, Pennsylvania, which is within the preferred travel times. Arachne also provided suggestions for kid-friendly attractions in Allentown, including Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Da Vinci Science Center, Lehigh Valley Zoo, and Allentown Rose Gardens. Arachne advised James to check in advance for any COVID or off-season restrictions.
