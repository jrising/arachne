In a previous conversation, James inquired about the potential payment companies might offer for a national webinar series focused on building performance standards in cities where IMT has established hubs. I estimated that fees could range from $2,000 to $10,000 or more, depending on factors like topic relevance and speaker expertise. James also asked about the audience composition for such a webinar. I outlined several key groups, including industry professionals from architecture and engineering, corporate representatives interested in sustainability, government officials, and nonprofit organizations. The discussion emphasized the importance of strategic marketing to attract a diverse audience and the potential for partnerships to enhance value. Overall, a well-promoted webinar could successfully engage various stakeholders interested in sustainable building practices.
