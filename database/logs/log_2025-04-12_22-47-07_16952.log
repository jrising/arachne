James inquired about generating a unique ID for rows in a Google Spreadsheet for his literature review, specifically seeking a solution that would remain unchanged even when entries are modified. I suggested a strategy combining static elements with a unique identifier, recommending the use of Google Apps Script to auto-generate sequential numeric IDs or timestamps upon the addition of new rows. The implementation steps included adding a dedicated column for the unique ID, writing a script to create the ID, and formatting it to include authors and year while maintaining independence from editable fields. I emphasized the importance of safeguarding the ID's integrity and regularly backing up the data.
