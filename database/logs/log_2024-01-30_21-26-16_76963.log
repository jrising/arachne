The report by Dewberry Engineers (2018) identifies key issues and data requirements for offshore aquaculture siting in Delaware's ocean and bay areas. The issues include the need to identify suitable areas and species for aquaculture, understand and minimize impacts from proposed projects, and enhance understanding of ocean health and water quality impacts. The data requirements highlight the need for ecological data, such as the abundance and distribution of marine species, as well as information on water quality factors like marine debris, oil spills, and harmful algal blooms. Spatial data needs include information on jurisdictions, regulated areas, bathymetry, and species/habitat locations. Additionally, human activity data, including commercial fishing efforts and vessel traffic, is crucial for minimizing impacts and guiding regulations. These identified data requirements reveal potential data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. Lack of up-to-date or comprehensive data on marine species distribution, water quality impacts, and human activity could hinder effective planning and management efforts. It underscores the importance of collecting and analyzing cross-disciplinary data to support sustainable marine spatial planning. Source: Dewberry Engineers (2018)
