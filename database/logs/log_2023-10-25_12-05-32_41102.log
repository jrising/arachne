In a previous discussion, James inquired about the difference between the `%>%` and `|>` operators in the `dplyr` package in R. Arachne explained that while both operators are used for chaining operations, the primary distinction is in visual preference and compatibility with older versions of R. Arachne provided examples and highlighted that `%>%` is the more established and widely used operator in the R community, with broader compatibility and community support. On the other hand, `|>` is a newer operator with subtle differences in how it handles the evaluation of arguments, and it cannot be used with the `.` placeholder. Arachne emphasized that the choice between the two operators depends on personal style and potentially the conventions followed in one's codebase or team, as there is negligible difference in performance.
