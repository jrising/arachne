In this discussion, James asked about terms related to data characteristics. The assistant explained that "data recency" or "data timeliness" is used to describe how recently data was collected or updated. James also inquired about the terminology for distinguishing the comprehensiveness and completeness of a dataset. The assistant clarified that "data coverage" refers to the extent to which a dataset includes all relevant groups, while "data completeness" refers to the thoroughness of measuring each included group. James then asked for the term for data collected about the ocean on a ship, to which the assistant replied that it is called "oceanographic data".
