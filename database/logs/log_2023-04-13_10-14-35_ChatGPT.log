The conversation focused on calculating the indirect multiplier effect from the output of an IMPLAN impact analysis. The assistant provided a step-by-step process for calculating the indirect multiplier effect:

1. Find the total output multiplier for the region or industry being analyzed.
2. Subtract the direct effect from the total output multiplier.
3. The resulting value represents the indirect effect or indirect multiplier effect.

An example was given where a total output multiplier of 2.5 and a direct effect of 1.0 resulted in an indirect effect of 1.5. This means that for every dollar of direct economic activity, an additional 1.5 dollars of economic activity will be generated indirectly.
