James asked for a word to convey that a version of a file is simplified for development-only purposes. The assistant provided a list of suggestions, including prototype, mockup, draft, alpha, beta, prelim, devVersion, sandbox, debug, and test. Each word has slightly different connotations but can be used to convey a simplified or development-oriented version of a file.
