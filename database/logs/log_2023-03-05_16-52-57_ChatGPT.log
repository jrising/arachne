In the conversation, James asked how long infants can use a bassinet stroller. I explained that infants can typically use a bassinet stroller from birth until they reach a weight limit or outgrow the bassinet. Most bassinet strollers have a weight limit of around 20-25 pounds or until the baby is around 6 months old. However, it's important to check the manufacturer's specifications for the specific stroller being used. Once the baby reaches the weight limit or outgrows the bassinet, it's time to transition to a more appropriate stroller or carrier that can support their growing size and weight.
