The discussion focused on creating a synopsis for the Technical Scope Summary of the "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)" project. The Technical Scope Summary was divided into two budget periods, each with specific objectives related to the Community Benefits Plan (CBP). The first period aims to establish procedures, protocols, and a code of conduct to support inclusivity and engagement with underprivileged communities. The second period focuses on implementing workforce development programs, fostering relationships with communities, conducting environmental impact studies, and introducing performance measures to assess the effectiveness of the CBP.
