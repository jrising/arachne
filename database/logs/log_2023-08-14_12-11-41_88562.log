This discussion focuses on the development of the Community Benefits Plan (CBP) for the EMPOWER project, which aims to enable multi-disciplinary pathways in offshore wind education and research. The CBP is centered around three primary objectives: creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, promoting energy equity and environmental justice, and investing in America's workforce. The discussion addresses the specific actions and strategies outlined in the concept note for the CBP, including the development of equitable opportunities, the establishment of partnerships with stakeholder communities, and the implementation of workforce training and educational programs. The conversation also covers the objectives outlined in the Project Objectives section of the Statement of Project Objectives (SOPO) document and provides guidance for creating the Technical Scope Summary section of the SOPO, divided into Budget Periods 1 and 2. The Technical Scope Summary includes a description of the work scope and approach for each period, emphasizing the establishment of operational structures, engagement with underrepresented groups and coastal communities, workforce development initiatives, community feedback processes, environmental impact studies, and metrics for assessing CBP effectiveness. The overall goal is to foster a just and equitable transition to a renewable energy future.
