James inquired about the duration children typically stay sick from scarlet fever. In response, it was explained that the illness generally progresses through several phases: an initial “prodromal phase” lasting 24 to 48 hours, followed by an “acute phase” with the classic rash that can last about a week. The recovery, or “convalescent phase,” can take a few weeks, during which skin peeling might occur. Overall, children may be considered sick for 2 to 3 weeks, but once treated with antibiotics for 24 hours, they are usually no longer contagious. Consulting a healthcare professional for specific cases was advised.
