In a discussion about the relationship between vaccines and autism, James questioned whether autism is caused by vaccines. I clarified that extensive research shows no credible link, highlighting that the original 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield proposing this connection was retracted due to severe flaws and misconduct. I emphasized the consensus among health organizations, including the CDC and WHO, regarding vaccine safety. James further inquired about evidence presented by certain public figures asserting this claim. I explained that although some individuals promote erroneous evidence, it lacks scientific support and has been largely discredited. Reliable sources provide overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and essential for public health.
