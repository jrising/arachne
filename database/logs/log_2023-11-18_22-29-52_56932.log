This digest features a compilation of past conversations between James and Arachne. Topics covered include managing bedtime routines for children sharing a room, the nature of I/O model multipliers, chicken sausage preparation, causes of the urban heat island effect, recipe requests, sustainable gift ideas, DNS record TTL, password usage for installing 3rd-party drivers on Ubuntu, research statement contents for tenure, and trade losses. In the most recent conversation, James seeks advice on preparing an apple-pear pie with a pecan base. Arachne recommends taking the apple-pear mix out of the refrigerator, but no need to reheat, and to stir the glaze well if it contains dairy or eggs. The pie should be assembled, then pre-bake the pecan crust before adding the fillings, applying the glaze, and baking until golden brown.
