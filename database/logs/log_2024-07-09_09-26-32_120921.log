The discussion centered on energizing the commercial real estate sector through the partnership of USGBC and Green Lease Leaders with the introduction of LEEDv5 and GLLv2. Both frameworks aim for decarbonization, ecosystem restoration, and resilience, ensuring that all LEEDv5 buildings achieve GLLv2 recognition to support compliance with Building Performance Standards while advancing Net Zero goals. The synergy between the two programs enhances revenue opportunities, with LEEDv5 incorporating green leasing credits and GLLv2 integrating LEEDv5 points. Key activities are slated for 2024-2025, culminating in the Greenbuild Conference where the partnership and annual GLL award winners will be announced.
