James inquired about a term that encapsulates fish suitability, egg/larval development, and thermal bottlenecks affecting these processes. I suggested "**thermal habitat suitability**" as an appropriate term. This phrase signifies the significance of temperature in the viability of fish populations, impacting their growth, development, and survival, especially during egg and larval stages. It also emphasizes the constraints posed by thermal limitations, which are essential for understanding the effects of environmental changes on marine ecosystems.
