James inquired about joining two dataframes in pandas with different column names. The solution provided involved using the `merge()` function with specified column names and join type. An example was given with sample dataframes and code demonstrating the merge operation. The resulting merged dataframe was shown with a suggestion to drop redundant columns post-merge for clarity.
