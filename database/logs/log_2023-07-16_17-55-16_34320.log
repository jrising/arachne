James wanted to know if it's possible to run processing in the background between calls on a Flask app without using a task queue. Arachne provided a solution using threads and demonstrated how to implement it using the `atexit` module to ensure a clean termination of the background tasks. However, Arachne also emphasized the risks and potential complications associated with this approach and recommended considering task queue solutions like Celery or RQ for better handling of failures and scalability.
