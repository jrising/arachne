In a discussion about downloading content in Python, James asked for a solution to retrieve a URL that processes HTML and PDF responses differently while dropping unsupported content, as well as limiting excessive file sizes or download times. I provided a comprehensive Python script using the `requests` library for downloading, along with `beautifulsoup4` for HTML processing and `PyPDF2` for PDF handling. Key points included setting a timeout, checking content types, limiting the size of downloads, and handling errors. The script processes HTML in memory and saves PDFs to a file for further examination, with a clean-up step for the temporary file. Installation instructions for the required libraries were also provided.
