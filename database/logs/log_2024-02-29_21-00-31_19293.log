James sought guidance on estimating elasticity using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Arachne explained the process of log-transforming variables to create a log-log model, running OLS regression, and interpreting the coefficient as the elasticity. She emphasized the importance of validating the model and considering the limitations of point elasticity versus overall elasticity across all values of X.
