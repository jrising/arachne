James is preparing his external dossier for academic tenure as an interdisciplinary environmental economist and seeks guidance on what should be included in the research statement. The assistant advises including an introduction, prior research, future research, grants, collaboration/mentorship, and fit with the department. The introduction should provide a brief overview of the research. Prior research should describe past achievements, potentially using citation and bibliography. Future research should highlight planned projects and their contributions. Including grant information showcases funding success. Collaboration/mentorship and wider impacts should also be mentioned. Finally, James is encouraged to seek advice from senior colleagues or the tenure committee for further guidance on specific expectations based on disciplinary norms and institutional culture.
