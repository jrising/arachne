The discussion focused on the components of a research statement for an academic tenure dossier in interdisciplinary environmental economics. The assistant provided guidance on various subcomponents to include, such as an introduction, prior research achievements, future research plans, grants, collaboration and mentorship, and fit with the department. The importance of tailoring the research statement to disciplinary norms and institutional culture was emphasized, and the suggestion to seek advice from senior colleagues or the tenure committee was made.
