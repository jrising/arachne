In a previous conversation, James asked how to load raster data stored in a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) on Microsoft Planetary Computer under Python. The assistant provided a step-by-step guide using libraries such as `pystac`, `rasterio`, and `numpy`. The steps included installing the required libraries, defining the STAC Catalog URL, loading the STAC Catalog, finding the desired STAC Item, accessing the available assets, opening the file with `rasterio.open`, reading the raster data with `rasterio.read`, and processing the data using `numpy`. The assistant emphasized that the specific details may vary depending on the STAC Item and the raster data being loaded.
