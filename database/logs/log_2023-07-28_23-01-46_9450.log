James was encountering an issue with his Passenger website where he was unable to access the site on his desktop but could access it on his phone. The AI assistant suggested several possibilities for the cause of the issue, including a DNS cache problem, a hosts file override, firewall or security software blocking access, unique network settings, or browser extensions causing the problem. The assistant advised James to clear the DNS cache, check the hosts file, temporarily disable firewall or security software, reset network settings, and try accessing the site in an incognito or private browser window or with disabled extensions. The assistant emphasized that changes might require a system restart to take effect and should be approached carefully.
