In a previous conversation, James wanted to improve the user experience of a chat page by implementing auto-scrolling only if the user is already at the bottom. The assistant provided a step-by-step guide for achieving this using JavaScript. However, James raised a concern about the user's scroll position potentially changing before the auto-scroll function is called. The assistant addressed this by suggesting a code refactoring that ensures `autoScrollIfAtBottom()` is only called after the new message has been added to the chat container and after any user-initiated scrolling has completed. The assistant provided a modified function, `addMessageAndScroll()`, that saves the scroll position and height before adding the new message and scrolls down only if the user is at the bottom or no new scrolling has occurred. James was advised to replace the `addMessage` call with `addMessageAndScroll()` to achieve the desired behavior and preserve the user's scroll position.
