James inquired about efficient broadcasting of non-primitive operations in Julia over a matrix of tuples and the usage of anonymous functions. The assistant provided examples using both anonymous and predefined functions, highlighting the efficiency of Julia's JIT compiler. Benchmarking and an optimized approach with `Base.Fix1` were suggested. In a subsequent query, James sought a solution to drop singleton dimensions resulting from `argmax` in Julia. The assistant recommended using the `dropdims` function with the appropriate dimension argument to remove singleton dimensions effectively.
