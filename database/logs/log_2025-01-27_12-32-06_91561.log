James asked for an explanation of the R function `get_mirca_cropland`, which calculates cropland fractions within countries and global land unit intersections using longitudinal and latitudinal data. The function takes two parameters: a raster brick that contains MIRCA cropland data and a mapping data table. The code utilizes spatial points for data extraction from the raster, renames data columns to simplify their names, and converts area measurements from hectares to square meters. The function ultimately returns a list with the new column names and the processed cropland data. Arachne provided a step-by-step breakdown of the function, focusing on its structure and output.
