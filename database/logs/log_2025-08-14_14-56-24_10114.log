James inquired about performing a hierarchical regression in R with the model structure `Value ~ Outcome + ISO : Outcome + Year : Outcome`. I suggested using the `lme4` package and provided a basic model setup with random intercepts for `Outcome`, `ISO`, and slopes for `Year`. He sought clarification on interpreting the random intercept `(1 + Outcome | ISO)` and expressed the need for slopes of `Year` varying by `Outcome`, not by `ISO`. I explained the model's components and adjusted the formula accordingly. Ultimately, James specified that he wanted intercepts for each `Outcome x ISO` pair drawn from a normal distribution, which I addressed by proposing the use of `(1 | Outcome:ISO)` for combined random intercepts while retaining varying slopes for `Year` by `Outcome`.
