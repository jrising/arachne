In this conversation, James asks how to sum values in a pandas dataframe by year when there are two indexes: 'poly_idx' and 'time'. The assistant provides two solutions based on whether the 'time' column is in the 'datetime64[ns]' format or not. If it is, James can use the `.resample()` method with the 'Y' parameter to resample the data by year. If not, James can convert the 'time' index to a datetime object using the `pd.to_datetime()` function and then proceed with the resampling. The assistant also explains that `resample()` is preferred over `groupby()` for time series data since it has built-in functionality for handling the temporal nature of the data and can handle missing data during the resampling process. Meanwhile, `groupby()` is more versatile and can be used for general grouping and aggregation operations on any column(s) in the dataframe.
