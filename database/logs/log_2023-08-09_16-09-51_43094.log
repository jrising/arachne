James encountered an error while trying to plot data with matplotlib. The error was due to multi-dimensional indexing on pandas Dataframes or Series, which is no longer supported. The assistant provided a solution by converting the data from pandas series to NumPy arrays using the `.values` method. The modified code resolved the issue. The assistant also requested additional details about the data and its structure to provide further assistance if needed.
