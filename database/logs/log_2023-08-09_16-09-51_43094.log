James encountered an error while trying to plot data with Matplotlib. The error message indicated that multi-dimensional indexing is no longer supported in pandas. In response, the assistant explained that James needs to convert the pandas series or dataframes into NumPy arrays before indexing. The assistant provided modified code that utilizes the `.values` method to convert the x and y columns of the dataframe `plotdf2` into NumPy arrays. The assistant also requested additional information about the structure of the data and how `plotdf2` is created.
