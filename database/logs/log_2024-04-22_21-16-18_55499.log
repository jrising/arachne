James inquired about the need for a host and an invitation letter to visit China as an American tourist. I clarified that generally, these are not required but mentioned the necessary documents for a tourist visa application, including a valid passport, visa application form, itinerary, and a copy of the passport. I advised checking the latest requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recommended applying for the visa at least a month in advance. Plus, I provided a source for further information from the Chinese embassy in the US.
