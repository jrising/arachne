James sought guidance on customizing legends, dodging points in boxplots, and applying `expand(0, 0)` to one side of an axis in `ggplot2`. Suggestions included setting `show.legend = FALSE` to exclude boxplots from legends, using `position_dodge()` to align points with dodged boxplots, and applying `expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))` asymmetrically for axis expansion control. The solutions provided aimed to improve plot aesthetics and layout customization for James's data visualizations in R using `ggplot2`.
