James inquired about implementing a Reddit-style upvoting system for collaborative voting and idea proposal on a vision statement. I suggested several platforms including Loomio, DemocracyOS, Pol.is, Kialo, Discourse, and a DIY approach using Google Forms and Sheets. James requested clarification on which of these platforms features an upvoting mechanism that allows contributions to "float to the top." I highlighted DemocracyOS, Kialo, and Discourse as suitable options, while also mentioning that a dedicated subreddit could be a straightforward alternative. The discussion focused on finding effective tools for fostering collaboration and visibility of popular ideas.
