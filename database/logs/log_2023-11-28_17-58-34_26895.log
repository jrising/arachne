In a previous conversation, James asked about using a GPL-licensed library in a tool he built and then selling consulting services using that tool. Arachne confirmed that it is permissible to do so and explained that the GPL primarily concerns the distribution of software, not the use or sale of services. Arachne outlined the requirements for using a GPL-licensed library, including including the original authors' copyright notices, providing the source code, and licensing any distributed versions of the product under the GPL. However, since James' consulting services involve using the tool rather than distributing it, the GPL restrictions may not directly apply. Arachne advised James to carefully read the specific license terms and seek legal advice to ensure compliance.
