The Delaware coastal economy is diverse, encompassing tourism, real estate, fishing, port activity, agriculture, renewable energy, and recreation. Since 2012, there have been notable changes, including increased tourism, real estate development, focus on renewable energy, agricultural challenges, the impact of climate change, expansion of the Port of Lewes, and growth of the digital economy.
