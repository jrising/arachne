In this conversation, James asked how to add a caption next to an image in Beamer. Arachne provided an example using the `minipage` environment. James then inquired about changing the line spacing when using the `small` environment. Arachne suggested using the `setspace` package and adjusting the line spacing manually. She provided an example that combined the `spacing` and `small` environments to achieve both small text size and modified line spacing.
