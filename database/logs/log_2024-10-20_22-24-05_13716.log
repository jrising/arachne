James explored using Docker for the first time, wanting to create or update an Ubuntu image with pre-installed Python and R. I guided him through the process of creating a `Dockerfile`, explaining that it should reside in a dedicated directory. I provided detailed steps to set up the Dockerfile, including using the official Ubuntu image as a base, updating the package list, and installing Python and R. Additionally, I instructed him on how to build the Docker image using the `docker build` command and how to run a container interactively. Finally, I suggested verifying the installations inside the container.
