The analysis of potential damages in the absence of mitigation measures and potential benefits from mitigation actions integrates results across several sectors. Under current policies, catastrophic risks towards the end of the century could cause losses estimated at 4.1% GDP. A high-mitigation scenario could curtail these impacts to 1.2% GDP. Trade losses are projected to increase over time under current policies, but a high-mitigation path can reduce these losses to 0.6% GDP by 2100. Coastal impacts are also expected to escalate, but high-mitigation policies can limit damages to 0.06% GDP by 2100. While damages in other sectors may be comparatively smaller, a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts and benefits justifies aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This analysis provides critical information for policy decision-making.
