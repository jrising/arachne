The discussion revolved around a LaTeX table that reported damage estimates in %GDP from an analysis. The assistant provided a comprehensive analysis of the potential damages in the absence of mitigation measures and the potential benefits from mitigation actions across various sectors. The discussion covered the risks of catastrophic damage, trade losses, and damages from coastal impacts due to climate change. The potential losses from catastrophic risks towards the end of the century were estimated at 4.1% GDP, but under a high mitigation scenario, they could be reduced to 1.2% GDP. The trade losses and damages from coastal impacts could also be significantly reduced under high mitigation. The assistant concluded that the potential damages in each sector highlight the need for serious consideration of high mitigation pathways.
