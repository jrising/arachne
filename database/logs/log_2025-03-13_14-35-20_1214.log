James inquired about the Washington Monument's construction date, and I informed him that it began on July 4, 1848, and completed on December 6, 1884, officially opening on October 9, 1888. He then asked about Napoleon's expeditions in Egypt; I responded that they occurred from 1798 to 1801, starting on July 1, 1798, and concluded in August 1801 after several military defeats.
