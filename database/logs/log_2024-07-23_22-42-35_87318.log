James seeks a name for a rat character tied to Dutch/Flemish roots in an Elizabethan-era narrative but later adjusts it to fit the historical context of the 1600s when tobacco became common. The assistant first suggests "Sergeant Pijptek," symbolizing playful whimsy and a connection to the evolving name "Buzfuz." Upon learning the tobacco timeline, the name shifts to "Sergeant Furzlebuz," retaining the whimsical essence akin to "Buzfuz" while aligning better with the era. Both names tie the rat character to mischievous traits and playful adventures during the Great Stranger Migration, enriching the ancestral lineage in James's storytelling.
