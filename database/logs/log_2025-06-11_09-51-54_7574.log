James inquired about how to grep a file for lines that include either "United Kingdom" or "UK" as distinct words. I provided him with a command using `grep` that utilizes the `-E` option for extended regular expressions and the `-w` option to match whole words. The suggested command was: 
```bash
grep -Ew 'United Kingdom|UK' filename.txt
``` 
I explained the functionality of each part of the command, emphasizing how to effectively search for the desired terms while ensuring accurate word matching.
