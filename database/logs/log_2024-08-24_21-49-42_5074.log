James sought help in `ggplot2` to order x-values from two different data frames consistently. The assistant advised setting factor levels identically in both data frames. When faced with facetting issues due to scale limitations, a workaround using ordered factors without explicit limits was provided. James later inquired about setting panel order in `facet_grid()`, and the assistant recommended converting the facet variable to an ordered factor. Complete code examples and explanations were provided for each step, ensuring James could control the order of both x-values and panels in his plots effectively.
