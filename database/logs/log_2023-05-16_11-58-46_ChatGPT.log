Weather variation and climate change pose risks to agricultural production, especially for perennial crops in developing countries. Misreported yields and unobserved management decisions can obscure our understanding of these risks. A study on Brazilian coffee production reveals that extreme temperatures not only reduce yields but also shrink reported harvest areas due to plant death and selective harvesting. Damages from extreme temperatures on production are twice their effect on reported yields, as the latter uses harvested area instead of bearing area. By incorporating these factors into a structural econometric framework, it is possible to distinguish the effects of management decisions. The analysis highlights a greater direct impact of extreme temperatures on biophysical yields and a multi-year plant death effect, improving our understanding of the relationship between prices, weather, and adaptation for perennial crops.
