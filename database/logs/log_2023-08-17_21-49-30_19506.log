The difference between a Marine National Monument and a National Marine Sanctuary lies in their purpose, governance, and establishment process. Marine National Monuments are established by Presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act and focus on protecting specific natural features or ecosystems, while National Marine Sanctuaries are designated by Congress or the Secretary of Commerce and emphasize comprehensive management, research, education, conservation, and public use.
