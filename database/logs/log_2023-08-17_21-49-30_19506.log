A Marine National Monument and a National Marine Sanctuary are both types of protected marine areas, but they differ in their purpose, governance, and establishment process. Marine National Monuments are established by presidential proclamation and focus on protecting specific natural features or ecosystems, including historical or cultural aspects. They are managed by federal agencies like NOAA or the Fish and Wildlife Service. On the other hand, National Marine Sanctuaries are designated by Congress or the Secretary of Commerce under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. They emphasize comprehensive management, research, education, conservation, and public use, with a focus on sustainable use and public access. Both designations promote regional stewardship goals, offer opportunities for research and education, and provide varying degrees of protection. However, the regulations and allowed uses can differ based on their establishing legislation or proclamation.
