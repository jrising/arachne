The data gaps concerning synthesized oceanographic parameters represent a significant challenge for Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. These parameters include currents, sea surface height, wave and wind information, water levels, tides, temperature, pH, salinity, chlorophyll A, zooplankton, and ocean color. Addressing these data gaps could improve understanding in areas such as offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience, species and habitat management, water quality, offshore renewable energy siting, and sediment management. Challenges also lie in the format of the data, which currently arrives in piecemeal instead of a synthesized format. The need for ocean acidification monitoring data has been highlighted, and densification or winterizing of monitoring devices is recommended. Standardized products on an ocean-basin scale for various parameters are also desired. By addressing these gaps, Delaware's marine regions can benefit from a more sustainable and efficient planning process.
