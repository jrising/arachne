In this conversation, James asked if he could create a legend in QGIS's layout designer to describe the size of a marker, which is based on a variable. The assistant explained that while it is possible, it is not as straightforward as creating a color-based legend. The assistant provided steps to manually create a representative legend for size variables by adding rectangle or ellipse shapes and labeling them to describe what each size represents. The assistant warned that this method requires manual updating if the data changes. James expressed gratitude for the assistance and did not request further help with QGIS at that time.
