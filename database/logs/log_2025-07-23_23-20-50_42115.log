In the conversation, James inquired about a shorter way to express "5th percentile." I suggested using "P5" as a statistical shorthand but cautioned about audience familiarity. James wanted a more obvious alternative and proposed "5th perc'ile," to which I agreed as a clear and concise option that retains the original meaning while saving space.
