James asked about the term for uncertainty related to not knowing which world or scenario we are in, and I explained that it is called Knightian uncertainty. James then asked if it still counts as Knightian uncertainty if he has information that allows him to fully quantify the probabilities of different possible worlds. I responded that if he can fully quantify the probabilities, it is not Knightian uncertainty but rather probabilistic uncertainty. Knightian uncertainty arises when probabilities cannot be assigned due to lack of information or inherent unpredictability.
