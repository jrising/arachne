James requested multiple-choice questions to assess his students' understanding of a reading on climate change. The reading emphasized the large-scale transformation of natural systems and the restructuring of the global carbon cycle as distinct and significant in terms of scale, complexity, and economic significance. The reading also mentioned the average amount of carbon dioxide emitted by an average human each year, the impact of greenhouse gases on the Earth's energy balance, and the use of climate models to understand climate change. Additionally, the reading highlighted the importance of emissions scenarios, such as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), in climate models. Arachne provided a set of sample multiple-choice questions for evaluation, covering topics like the distinguishing features of climate change, carbon dioxide emissions, the role of greenhouse gases, the relationship between greenhouse gas concentrations and the effective radiating level, the function of climate models, and the definition of RCPs.
