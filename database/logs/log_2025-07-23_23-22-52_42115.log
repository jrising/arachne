James asked for a shorter way to write "5th percentile." I suggested using "P5" for statistical contexts but advised him to consider audience familiarity. Seeking a more obvious alternative, James proposed "5th perc'ile." I confirmed that it was a clear and concise option. He then considered "5th perc.," and I endorsed it as a succinct alternative that effectively conveys the meaning of the 5th percentile.
