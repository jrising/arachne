In a discussion about climate finance in Bangladesh, various aspects of the EDC2020 working paper were explored. James inquired about the effectiveness of Bangladesh in raising international finance, highlighting the country's active role in UNFCCC negotiations as a recognized Least Developed Country (LDC). Responses indicated that Bangladesh has successfully established two main trust funds—the BCCTF and BCCRF—effectively mobilizing both domestic and international resources for climate resilience. Additionally, commitments from agencies like the ADB and World Bank were noted as crucial for funding specific climate adaptation projects. The government's proactive creation of frameworks like the BCCSAP has further catalyzed international support, although challenges remain in managing diverse climate finance streams.
