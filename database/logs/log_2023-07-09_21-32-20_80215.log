James was using the `model.matrix()` function in R to create a predictor matrix for an econometric model. He had boolean columns that were showing up twice in the predictor matrix, but he wanted only one column to be included. I explained that he could control which column is dropped by using the `contrasts.arg` argument and provided an example code snippet. In a follow-up, James mentioned that neither the TRUE nor FALSE factors were being dropped as expected. I suggested potential reasons for this issue, including the variable not being recognized as a factor, incorrect specification of the contrast method, or the column being a logical variable instead of a factor. I requested more specific information to assist further.
