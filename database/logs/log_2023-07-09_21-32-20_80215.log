James is using `model.matrix` in R to create a predictor matrix for an econometric model. However, the boolean columns are showing up twice in the predictor matrix, causing linear dependence. The assistant provides a solution using the `contrasts.arg` argument to control the dropping of columns. James encounters an issue where the factors for TRUE and FALSE are not being dropped, and the assistant suggests potential reasons including improper factor definition, incorrectly specified contrast method, or the variable being treated as a logical variable instead of a factor.
