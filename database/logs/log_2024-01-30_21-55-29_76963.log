A report by Dewberry Engineers (2018) highlights key data requirements and issues relevant to Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. The report identifies the need for comprehensive data on recreational patterns, suitable locations for artificial reefs, conflicts between recreational and commercial activities, and various data requirements such as vessel traffic, human and cultural use areas, water quality, and more. However, the report also emphasizes the existence of data gaps that hinder the planning process. These gaps include the lack of comprehensive vessel traffic data, the need for granular information on human and cultural use areas, and the incomplete understanding of water quality threats such as marine debris, harmful algal blooms, and oil spills. Addressing these data gaps is crucial to developing an informed and effective planning process for Delaware's ocean and bay spaces.
