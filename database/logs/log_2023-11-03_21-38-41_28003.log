James asked how to put a `summarize()` call into a function in R using `dplyr`. Arachne provided a solution to create a function called `summarize_many_things()` that takes a data frame and an arbitrary number of column names as arguments using the ellipsis syntax. The function uses the `summarize()` function within `dplyr`, allowing the column names to be customized dynamically. Arachne also presented an alternative approach using the `across()` function and the `all_of()` function to handle column names as strings, preserving the common logic in `MANY_THINGS`. This allows for the reuse of the function while accommodating different column names.
