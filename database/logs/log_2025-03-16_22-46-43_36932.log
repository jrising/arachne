In the conversation, James shared a text-based layout of a PDF introducing a report on climate change and systemic risks. The report emphasizes that climate change will increase extreme weather events and alter resources for agriculture and ecosystems, raising concerns about large-scale existential risks to societies and economies. Despite some quantification of direct risks, robust assessments of systemic risks remain scarce. The recent IPCC report describes complex risks without specifically assessing systemic ones. The discussion highlighted the importance of integrating quantitative and qualitative information to evaluate risks comprehensively. Additionally, the report aims to develop a methodology for assessing regional and global systemic risks based on various emissions pathways, focusing on ecosystem change impacts. The report relies on a thorough review of existing literature to support its findings.
