In a prior conversation on November 27, 2023, James inquired about whether Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models have static elasticities of substitution between sectors. I confirmed that CGE models typically utilize static elasticities, which are predefined parameters that do not change during the model run. These elasticities represent the degree of substitution between inputs or goods within various sectors and are estimated from historical data or expert judgment. Their fixed nature ensures consistency and robustness in the model's results, although the selection of these elasticities is critical as they significantly impact the model's outcomes.
