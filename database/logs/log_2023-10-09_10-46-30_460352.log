In a previous conversation, James asked about the anesthesia and recovery required for getting a permanent crown after a root canal treatment. I explained that the placement of a permanent crown usually doesn't require anesthesia or extensive recovery as the tooth is likely to be numb from the previous procedure. However, the level of anesthesia might vary depending on tooth sensitivity and personal preference. I advised James to consult with his dentist or endodontist for a more personalized recommendation.
