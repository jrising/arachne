James inquired about the origins of the Phoenix, drawing parallels with the Pegasus's creation from Medusa's neck. Arachne explained the Phoenix's mythological background across various cultures, highlighting its association with the sun and themes of rebirth and immortality.

Although no god is exclusively tied to the Phoenix, it is often linked with the sun deities Helios in Greek mythology and Ra in Egyptian mythology, reflecting its solar connections and themes of rejuvenation.
