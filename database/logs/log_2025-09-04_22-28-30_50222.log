In this conversation, James inquired about the difference between government consumption and fiscal expenditure. I clarified that government consumption pertains to spending on the government's own consumption of goods and services—like salaries and utilities—while fiscal expenditure is a broader category that includes all government spending. Fiscal expenditure encompasses government consumption as well as investments, transfers, and interest payments, thereby supporting various economic and social objectives. The distinction highlights the specific focus of government consumption within the wider scope of fiscal policy.
