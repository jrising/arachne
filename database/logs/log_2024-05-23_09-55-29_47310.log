James asked about approximating \( R^2 \) from the log-likelihood in a least-squares analysis. The assistant provided a method to calculate \( R^2 \) using the total and residual variance, and presented an approximation method based on the log-likelihood equation and the relationship with the residual sum of squares. The assistant summarized the steps involved in estimating \( R^2 \) from the log-likelihood and offered further assistance if needed.
