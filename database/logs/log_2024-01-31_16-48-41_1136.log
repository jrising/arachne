James requested assistance in adding extra space to the left of a ggplot graph that he was using `coord_flip()` on. I provided him with a solution using the `theme` function and adjusting the `plot.margin`. Because `coord_flip()` flips the x and y axes, the extra space needed to be added to the 'top' margin instead of the 'left' one. I provided an example code snippet and explained how to adjust the `l` parameter in `margin()` to fit James's specific needs. This solution should give him the desired extra space to the left of his labels.
