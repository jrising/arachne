James asked how to generate a shapefile from a list of coordinates using QGIS, R, or Python. Arachne provided a Python script using the `geopandas` and `shapely` libraries. The script converts the coordinates to decimal degrees, creates a polygon, and exports it as a shapefile. Arachne also clarified that the last entry doesn't need to be a duplicate of the first entry for the shapefile to represent a closed polygon.
