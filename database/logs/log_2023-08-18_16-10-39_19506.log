James wanted to convert a list of coordinates into a shapefile using QGIS, R, or Python. The assistant suggested using Python with the `geopandas` and `shapely` libraries. They provided a Python script that converts the coordinates to decimal degrees and creates a shapefile. The assistant also noted that the last coordinate doesn't need to be a duplicate of the first coordinate for the shapefile to represent a closed polygon.
