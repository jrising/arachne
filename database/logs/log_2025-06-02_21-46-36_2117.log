In the conversation, James sought assistance in testing "multi-level logistic regression modeling" in R for a scenario where respondents select sell amounts based on varied prices. He questioned the validity of a method where sell amounts were treated as separate observations in a binary regression, expressing concern over artificially low standard errors. I confirmed that a multi-level model considering respondents as random effects would be more appropriate. James later requested example data comprising 100 respondents presented with 3 price levels and that the true data-generating process for sell amounts be based on a linear relationship with respondent-specific intercepts and slopes. I provided R code to generate such data, ensuring sell amounts were appropriately capped and created a binary ‘chosen’ variable based on the generated sell amount. The discussion aimed to prepare data for valid analysis methods while addressing modeling concerns.
