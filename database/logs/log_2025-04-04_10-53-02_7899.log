In a recent conversation, James Rising reached out to Florence Bates to invite her to join an advisory panel for a project on climate change risks and adaptation, which he is conducting in collaboration with the London School of Economics. Florence suggested that her colleague, Ariana, who is the lead economist for the Fourth Climate Change Risk Assessment, would be a suitable representative. James expressed his previous interactions with Ariana in the CCRA4 economics advisory group and proposed a meeting to discuss the project further. He offered to send additional background information to both Florence and Ariana, and provided a link for scheduling a chat.
