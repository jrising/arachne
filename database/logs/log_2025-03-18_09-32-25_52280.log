In the discussion, James provided excerpts from a PDF related to the social cost of carbon, adaptation investments, and a database assessing their benefits and returns. Key points included assumed costs of $60 and $75 per tCO2eq for projects based on their approval dates and the use of a standard 25-year time horizon and 5% discount rate. Limitations of the study were highlighted, such as a small sample size, lack of comprehensive data from all developing countries, and issues with standardization in methodologies for cost-benefit analyses. Notably, only 8.4% of projects valued all three dividends of adaptation investments. The database was deemed valuable for documenting actual investments, despite not being exhaustive, and further research is needed to better demonstrate the economic returns on adaptation investments.
