Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki, a research assistant and MSc student at the American University in Cairo, reached out to James Rising regarding the possibility of Ph.D. supervision in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. Abdulbaki expressed his interest in working under James' guidance, highlighting his research on renewable energy consumption and economic growth, as well as his forthcoming paper on carbon emission disclosure and firm value.
