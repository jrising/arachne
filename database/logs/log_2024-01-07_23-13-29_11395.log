James provided a list of files on his server and asked about their purpose. The files are part of the **Pligg CMS**, an open-source software for building social network websites where users can submit and vote on content. Key components in the directory structure include `index.php`, the main file for the website, `config.php`, the configuration file, and various PHP files for specific webpages or processes. The directory also contains files related to the [Smarty](https://www.smarty.net/) templating engine, which separates logic from presentation. The `plugins` and `modules` directories are common locations for adding extensions to the core system, and the `templates` directory likely contains HTML templates. The Pligg README and license files offer more information, and although the software is no longer actively maintained, there might be community support available.
