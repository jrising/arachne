This conversation focused on color-blind safe palettes for qualitative data. The discussion began with a request for a palette with ten colors, to which two examples were provided: Tableau's "Color Blind Palette" and ColorBrewer's "Qualitative Palette." The importance of adding labels and patterns to ensure accessibility was emphasized. Later, a request was made for code using a color-blind palette with eleven entries. A Python code snippet was provided that used the Tableau Color Blind Palette and Matplotlib to create a sample plot with eleven lines. The code was customizable for different visualization needs.
