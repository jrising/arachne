In a discussion focused on the impacts of the Trump administration on corporate grant-making and funding, James inquired about how corporations were shifting their strategies. I noted that many were increasing investments in environmental and social governance (ESG), emphasizing civic participation, and altering lobbying efforts to align with strategic interests. Following this, James asked specifically about foundations committed to climate action and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) under the new administration. I highlighted several foundations, such as the ClimateWorks Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and others, that remained dedicated to climate initiatives and sustainable practices regardless of political changes. I emphasized the importance of checking the latest updates from these organizations for current information.
