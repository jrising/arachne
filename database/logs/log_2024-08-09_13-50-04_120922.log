James inquired how the Institute for Market Transformation's (IMT) Building Innovation Hubs supports the Joyce Foundation's portfolio, emphasizing the transition to carbon-free electricity in Great Lakes states. I highlighted four key points: 

1. **Securing Long-term Commitments**: IMT engages local governments and businesses to improve energy performance, aligning with the Foundation's decarbonization goals.
   
2. **Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Policies**: Hubs promote best practices and the adoption of renewable energy, directly supporting the Foundationâ€™s objectives.
   
3. **Support Policy Innovation**: They foster innovative policies for energy efficiency, aiding comprehensive decarbonization efforts.
   
4. **Promoting Racial Equity and Energy Justice**: IMT's commitment to equity aligns with the Foundation's mission, ensuring climate action is just.

I concluded that funding IMT's initiatives would provide tangible impacts toward sustainability and social equity.
