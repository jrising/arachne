James sought to create a histogram-like plot with custom-width bins in `plot_ly` using `add_ribbons`. The issue of points connecting incorrectly was due to ordering. I recommended using `add_polygons` instead for better control over point order. I provided steps to prepare data points in the desired order for each bin and a sample code snippet using `add_polygons` in `shiny`. This approach solved the problem of misconnected points and allowed for creating bins with custom widths accurately in the plot.
