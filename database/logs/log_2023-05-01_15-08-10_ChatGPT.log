Factor analysis in R can be performed using the `factanal()` function from the base stats package. First, load the dataset and check its suitability for factor analysis using the Bartlett's test of sphericity and the KMO measure of sampling adequacy. Then, use the `factanal()` function to perform factor analysis, specifying the desired number of factors and rotation method. Interpret the results by examining factor loadings. Optional visualizations can be created using biplots or heatmaps. To calculate factor scores (f) that minimize the error term (epsilon), use the `factor.scores()` function from the `psych` package. Additionally, obtain the error term (epsilon) by subtracting the product of factor scores and factor loadings from the original data. Quality evaluation can be done using mean squared error (MSE) or other error metrics.
