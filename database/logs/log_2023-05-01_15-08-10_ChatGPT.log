The assistant provided step-by-step instructions on how to conduct factor analysis using the `factanal()` function and how to obtain factor scores using the `psych` package. Clarifications were made regarding the availability of the `scores()` function, with the correct approach being to use the `factor.scores()` function. The process of calculating the error term was also explained.
