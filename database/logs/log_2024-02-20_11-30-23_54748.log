James is preparing to teach Climate Change Economics using Chapter 2 of the Stern Review. Arachne provides multiple-choice questions based on the chapter to assess student understanding of key concepts like the global causes and consequences of climate change, ethical perspectives, and the necessity for economic analysis to consider long time horizons, risks, and non-marginal changes. The questions aim to evaluate comprehension of the interdisciplinary nature of analyzing climate change impacts and the importance of ethical considerations in guiding policy recommendations.
