Food production and fisheries rely on various ecosystem services, including soil fertility, pollination, pest control, water regulation and purification, climate regulation, genetic resources, and cultural services. Health problems arising from food scarcity, nutrient deficiency, and exposure to toxic agricultural and fishery products include malnutrition, stunted growth, weakened immune function, anemia, cognitive impairments, and various diseases. The CO2 fertilization effect, which increases crop yields but decreases nutrient content, could exacerbate protein-energy malnutrition, zinc deficiency, and iron deficiency, leading to conditions like kwashiorkor, marasmus, impaired growth and development, weakened immune function, and anemia. These health consequences highlight the importance of diverse diets, the use of nutrient-rich crop varieties, and potential supplementation or fortification strategies in at-risk communities. The broader impacts of climate change also affect agricultural productivity and food security.
