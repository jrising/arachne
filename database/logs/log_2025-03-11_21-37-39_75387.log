In a previous discussion, James requested assistance on how to vertically displace points in a `ggplot2` plot where the x-axis represents a categorical variable. I suggested using `position_nudge()` to specify the vertical shift for the `geom_point`. I provided an example using a data frame and demonstrated how to apply `position_nudge(y = 0.2)` to shift the points upwards by 0.2 units. This technique allows for better visibility of points that might overlap while emphasizing their positions above their respective categories.
