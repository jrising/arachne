In a previous discussion, James requested clear instructions for revising comments on a deliverable from an ongoing grant. The main focus was to clarify the relevance of vulnerability indicators to various sectors, emphasizing the need for a more targeted subset. I suggested a rewording that explicitly asks for a review of chosen indicators to enhance accuracy. Additionally, feedback on specific aspects of the deliverable was provided for MOE, Lappeenranta, and Oristano, including the need for clearer evaluation metrics and relation to existing projects. The revised comments aimed to make corrective actions and expectations clearer for the consortium and for Jamesâ€™s understanding of desired outcomes.
