James requested assistance in creating multiple-choice questions to assess students' understanding of the reading material from Hsiang 2016 on climate change economics. The questions focused on key aspects such as the primary focus of the review, the role of weather variation, challenges in research design, methodological advancements, and applications of empirical estimates. The purpose was to ensure students comprehensively engaged with the material and understood essential points related to methodology, challenges, and applications discussed in the reading.
