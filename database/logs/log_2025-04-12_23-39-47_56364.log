James requested a way to perform a non-asynchronous page fetch in JavaScript, expressing difficulty using `await fetch`. I explained that `fetch` is asynchronous and recommended using `XMLHttpRequest` for synchronous requests, cautioning against its use due to performance concerns. I provided an example function `fetchSync` using `XMLHttpRequest` to make synchronous GET requests. I also highlighted key considerations, including the deprecation of synchronous XHR, the advantages of embracing asynchronous programming, and the potential use of service or web workers for controlled asynchronous behavior. Finally, I encouraged James to share more context for personalized assistance in aligning with modern web development practices.
