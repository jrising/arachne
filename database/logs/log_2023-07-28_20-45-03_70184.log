In the conversation, James asked why some people avoid putting nice knives into dishwashers. I explained that there are several reasons for this. First, the dishwasher's cleaning action can damage the knife edge by causing it to knock against other utensils or the dishwasher itself. Second, the alkaline detergents used in dishwashers can cause corrosion and rust on the knife, although high-quality stainless steel knives are more resistant. Third, the heat and moisture in the dishwasher can damage the handle, especially if it's made of wood or fine steel/titanium. Finally, leaving exposed knife blades in the dishwasher can create a potential for accidents. To maintain the quality and longevity of nice knives, it is best to hand-wash them with mild soap, dry them immediately, and store them properly.
