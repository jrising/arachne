The conversation explores the reasons why some people avoid putting nice knives in dishwashers. The response highlights that the dishwasher's cleaning action can damage the knife edge and cause corrosion and rust. Additionally, the heat and moisture in the dishwasher can harm the handle and there is a potential for accidental injuries when handling exposed knife blades. Best practice is to hand-wash nice knives with mild soap, then immediately dry and store them properly.
