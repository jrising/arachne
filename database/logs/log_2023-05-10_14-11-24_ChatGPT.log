In a previous conversation, James asked if there were researchers at the University of Delaware studying Just Transitions or other aspects of the green transition. The assistant provided general advice on how to identify potential researchers in these areas, including looking for faculty with expertise in related fields, checking their publications and ongoing projects, and exploring interdisciplinary partnerships. James then requested a letter of introduction from the Department Head of the Business School, Adrienne Lucas, to introduce potential faculty members who could support a project in Just Transitions. The assistant composed a letter in which Adrienne Lucas mentioned the university's commitment to sustainability and highlighted a few relevant faculty members for the recipient's project, while also suggesting the Center for Energy & Environmental Policy (CEEP) and the Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN) as additional resources.
