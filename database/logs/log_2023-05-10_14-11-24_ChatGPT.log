James inquired about researchers in the University of Delaware Economics, Applied Economics, and Business School departments who study Just Transitions and the green transition. The Assistant provided general guidance to identify potential researchers and suggested checking the Center for Energy & Environmental Policy (CEEP) and the Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN) for relevant researchers. James then requested a draft letter of introduction from Adrienne Lucas, the department head of the Business School, introducing the recipient to faculty members who could support a project in Just Transitions. The Assistant produced a letter, including a brief introduction, three potential faculty members, and recommendations for exploring CEEP and DENIN.
