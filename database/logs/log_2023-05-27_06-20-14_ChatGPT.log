The conversation focused on drafting a "Research Needs" section for a report on the economic contribution of Delaware's coastal area and the risks it faces due to climate change. The key research areas identified include the projected impacts of climate change, effectiveness of natural and hybrid systems for coastal protection, barriers to implementing natural projects, and personal stories from affected residents and businesses. The research needs highlighted the importance of quantifying potential economic losses, evaluating disaster preparedness, comparing cost-effectiveness and protective value of natural and hybrid systems, reviewing the permitting process, understanding barriers to implementation, and collecting qualitative data to provide a human perspective. Addressing these research needs will help inform policy development and strategic planning to preserve Delaware's coastal economy in the face of climate change risks.
