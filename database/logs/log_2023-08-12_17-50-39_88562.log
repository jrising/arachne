Nasrin Badrzadeh, a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering from Tarbiat Modares University, has reached out to James Rising inquiring about available funded Ph.D. positions. While Nasrin does not specify her program of interest, her background and research interests suggest she may be interested in either the Ph.D. in Marine Policy or the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. Nasrin has a strong track record in water resource management and has published papers related to water quality in rivers and nonpoint source pollution discharges. Her email demonstrates a clear interest in James' research focus, particularly in climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. Nasrin's experience in modeling and assessing management practices in water systems aligns well with James' research interests. A request for clarification regarding her specific program interests would be necessary.
