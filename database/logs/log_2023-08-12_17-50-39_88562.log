Nasrin Badrzadeh, a graduate student in Water Structure Engineering, is seeking a fully-funded Ph.D. position under James's supervision. It is unclear which program she is specifically interested in, but her background suggests a potential interest in either the Ph.D. in Marine Policy or the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. Nasrin has experience in water resource management and has published papers related to water quality in rivers and nonpoint source pollution discharges. Her email demonstrates a clear interest in James's research areas, particularly in modeling and assessment of management practices on agricultural nonpoint source pollution discharges into river systems.
