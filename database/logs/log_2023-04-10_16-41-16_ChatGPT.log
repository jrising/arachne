In a previous conversation, James asked for adult musicals with a similar musical feel as Disney princess movies. The assistant provided a list of musicals that fit the criteria, including "Wicked," "Anastasia," "Frozen" (the Broadway adaptation), "The Little Mermaid" (the Broadway adaptation), "Cinderella" (Rodgers and Hammerstein's adaptation), "Into the Woods," and "Beauty and the Beast" (the stage adaptation). The assistant highlighted that these musicals feature strong female leads, catchy tunes, and a touch of magic. The recommendations would appeal to fans of Disney princess movies who are looking for more mature storylines.
