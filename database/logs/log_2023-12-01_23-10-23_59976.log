Inquiring about provisions on the whaling ship Pequod from Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick," James asked for a typical food manifest for a three-year voyage. Arachne described the provisions commonly found on whaling ships, including hardtack/biscuits, salted meats, pickled foods, dried legumes, barreled/dried fish, flour/sugar/molasses, hard cheese, sea biscuits, alcohol, tea/coffee, water/vinegar, oil/vinegar, and rice/cornmeal/oatmeal. In response to James' subsequent question about the quantity of each provision required for the full Pequod crew, Arachne estimated the amounts based on historical records and assumptions. These quantities included 2,190 pounds of hardtack, 1,095 pounds of salted meats, 375 pints of pickled foods, 1,560 pounds of legumes, 2,400 pounds of barreled fish, 600 pounds of flour, 200 pounds of sugar, 100 pounds of molasses, 1,260 pounds of hard cheese, 1,440 pounds of sea biscuits, 3,285 pints of alcohol, 1,095 ounces of tea/coffee, 21,900 liters of water, 5 gallons of oil/vinegar, and 6,000 pounds of rice/cornmeal/oatmeal. These estimates are subject to variations in crew size, voyage length, food availability, and individual consumption.
