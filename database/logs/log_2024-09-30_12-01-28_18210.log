James Rising received an inquiry from Nasrin Salehi, who expressed interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Science and Management at the University of Delaware. Nasrin's background includes a Master's in Intellectual Property Laws and current work as an IP specialist focused on green technologies. James acknowledged her impressive qualifications but noted the program does not offer a Ph.D. Instead, he recommended the Marine Policy Ph.D. program, suggesting that her research interests could align well. He encouraged her to mention him in her statement of purpose and advised applying early for funding considerations.
