Delaware marine waters are vital for a range of marine species, including the North Atlantic Right Whale and Atlantic Sturgeon. It serves as a migratory corridor and critical habitat for these species, respectively. Additionally, the region is recognized as a Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) for Sand Tiger Shark, Sandbar Shark, and Summer Flounder, as well as two Omnibus Essential Fish Habitat Amendment 2 areas. Furthermore, Delaware's mid-Atlantic region is an essential habitat for various highly migratory fish and shark species, covering both on and beyond the continental shelf. The report underscores the need for robust conservation and management strategies to preserve these significant marine habitats and the diverse ecosystems they support.
