James wants to set up an infinite menu on his Flask website using jQuery's Menu class. The menu will load the first and second levels initially, and when a first-level item is selected, an AJAX query will collect the third-level items for the second-level item chosen. James has a function called `get_submenus` in Python that returns a list of tuples (ROOTID, LABEL) for the submenus. Arachne provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up the menu, including a Flask endpoint to return submenu items via AJAX, an HTML template with the necessary structure, and JavaScript code to initialize the menu and handle the AJAX loading of submenus. The code demonstrates a basic implementation and can be customized and expanded based on James' specific requirements.
