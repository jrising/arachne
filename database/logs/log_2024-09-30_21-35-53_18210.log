James inquired about the expected contents of a standard DOE grant proposal's 3-page CV. I provided a structured outline detailing the key components to include, such as contact information, professional preparation, appointments, research experience, selected publications, synergistic activities, honors and awards, professional memberships, collaborators and affiliations, and optionally, teaching and mentoring experience. Each element aims to clearly communicate qualifications and demonstrate relevance to the DOE grant's goals. I emphasized the importance of tailoring the CV to align with specific requirements and efficiently highlight expertise.
