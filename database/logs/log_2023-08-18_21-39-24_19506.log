Delaware is making significant strides towards renewable energy with proposed wind projects by US Wind and Ørsted. US Wind plans to install 76 turbines covering 80,000 acres, while Ørsted Skipjack Wind plans for about 70 turbines. The Ørsted wind farm is expected to generate enough power for 300,000 homes and be operational by 2026. Cable landings for these projects are proposed near Rehoboth Beach and along the Delaware Seashore State Park.
