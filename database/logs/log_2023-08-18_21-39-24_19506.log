Delaware is moving forward with significant wind planning in its marine waters. US Wind and Ørsted have proposed separate projects that would bring large-scale wind farms to the Delaware coast. US Wind's proposal includes 76 turbines, reaching heights between 817 and 938 feet, covering around 80,000 acres of marine space. Ørsted's Skipjack Wind project plans for approximately 70 turbines situated about 20 miles off the coast. This wind farm is projected to generate 966 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 300,000 homes, with power delivery expected in 2026. Cable landings for these projects are planned near Rehoboth Beach and along the Delaware Seashore State Park. These developments signify a significant step towards a sustainable and renewable future in Delaware.
