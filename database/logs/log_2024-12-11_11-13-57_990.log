The strategy for Corporate Fundraising and partnerships across BE teams focuses on forming partnerships with leading corporations and collaborating with industry players to create mutually beneficial programs. Efforts will also be made to grow memberships for each BE program by enhancing value and showcasing impact to attract Philanthropic Support. Key tactics include implementing a tiered loyalty program to reward engagement and potentially expand cross-program memberships, organizing two in-person networking events during DC Climate Week for community celebration and knowledge sharing, and providing high-quality educational content and enhanced Advisory Board engagement to deepen member involvement.
