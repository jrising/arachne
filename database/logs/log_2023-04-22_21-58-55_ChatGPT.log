James is designing a language using the letters N, I, and O with derived letters for words. They asked for a sequence of decisions to go from sensation to specific colors, the distinction between form and color, the inclusion of smell and taste, and an alternative color model. Arachne provided a proposed structure for the sequence, differentiated form and color as dimensions, expanded the Types of Outward Sensations to include smell and taste, and suggested the HSL model for describing colors.
