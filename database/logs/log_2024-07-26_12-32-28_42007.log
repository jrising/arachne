James inquired about a computationally efficient method in R to subtract a row of values from every row in a matrix for distance calculations. The assistant provided two effective solutions: one using broadcasting with matrix subtraction and the other utilizing the `sweep` function. The examples illustrated how to implement these methods and highlighted the efficiency of vectorized operations. James was equipped with practical techniques for his data manipulation needs, considering readability and convenience based on the size and requirements of his datasets.
