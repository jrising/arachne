In a previous conversation, James asked about the effect of wave height and other features on the potential speed of a 3-mast ship like the whaler Essex. The AI explained that wave height, direction, and frequency can influence a ship's speed by adding resistance in the form of wave drag. It provided a rough estimate equation, Δv ∝ h * sin(θ) * f, where Δv represents the speed decrease due to waves, h is the wave height, θ is the wave direction relative to the ship's direction, and f is the frequency of the waves. In a follow-up question, James asked whether the sin(θ) term should be in absolute value. The AI clarified that the sign of sin(θ) determines whether waves can help or hinder the ship's speed. When θ is 90 degrees or 270 degrees, the waves directly oppose or assist the ship's motion, respectively. When θ is 0 degrees or 180 degrees, there is no additional resistance from the waves. The AI suggested modifying the equation to include the absolute value of sin(θ) if accounting for both positive and negative effects of waves is desired.
