James sought advice on articulating the iterative relationship between Work Packages (WP) 1, 2, and 3 in the NOWASTING project to quantify ecosystem services. Arachne guided James in rephrasing the interdependence between WP1 and WP2-3, highlighting the collaborative process of deriving metrics for supporting and provision ecosystem services. The revised project structure emphasized stakeholder engagement, shared metrics development, and the reciprocal relationship between inputs from WP1 and WP2-3 for a comprehensive sustainability assessment.
