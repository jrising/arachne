In a discussion about the implications of a potential return of President Trump to the White House for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), it was noted that there could be reduced federal environmental regulations, uncertain funding for sustainability initiatives, and limited coordination on international agreements. As a result, IMT may need to enhance partnerships with businesses, seek private funding, and focus on subnational collaborations to continue advancing sustainability goals despite these challenges. The analysis emphasized the need for strategic adaptation in response to possible policy shifts.
