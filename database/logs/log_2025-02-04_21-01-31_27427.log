In a conversation about ensuring financial independence for his children, James expressed concerns about future job security in an AI-driven world and the potential burden of medical expenses on his estate. I recommended options such as establishing a trust fund with conditions to promote responsibility, providing financial education, and the possibility of securing essentials like housing. We discussed creating an irrevocable trust to protect assets from medical bills, as well as structuring the trust to allow for investment management and income-based distributions, similar to an endowment. Finally, James questioned the costs of professional trustee services, and I highlighted that banks offer trust management services at competitive rates, allowing flexibility, professional oversight, and potentially lower long-term costs.
