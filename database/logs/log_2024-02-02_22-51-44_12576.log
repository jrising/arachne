In a previous conversation, James asked if it is possible to refresh the menu in the jquery-ui menu class without losing his place in it. Arachne explained that the jQuery UI menu's `.refresh()` method rebuilds the entire active menu when there are changes in its structure. This means that the active state of the menu would be lost. Arachne suggested a workaround where James can manually manage the active state by saving the focus or active state before calling refresh and then recalling it. Arachne provided a sample code snippet to demonstrate this workaround. The solution assumes that each menu item has a unique id. If not, James would need to find an alternative method to identify active items.
