James sought a Python solution using `subprocess.run` to collect command outputs while ignoring multiple lines of progress updates. I suggested capturing output with `subprocess.PIPE`, followed by post-processing to keep only the last line. James clarified that he wanted to retain the final state of a specific line being overwritten by a progress bar instead of always capturing the last line. I provided a more tailored approach using `subprocess.Popen` with regex to match and extract the relevant line in real-time. The solution involves compiling a regex pattern for the line of interest and updating the output as lines are read, ensuring that the final captured line reflects the most recent progress state.
