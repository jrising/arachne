In a previous conversation, James asked about reducing the space taken by a Subversion (SVN) repository and removing a directory completely. Arachne provided a step-by-step guide using the `svnadmin` command with `svndumpfilter` and `svnadmin load` options. The process involves creating a dump file of the repository, using `svndumpfilter` to filter out the desired directories, creating a new repository, loading the filtered dump file, and verifying the contents. Arachne also mentioned that you can remove multiple directories by specifying multiple `exclude` commands with `svndumpfilter`. It was advised to have a backup of the original repository before performing these operations.
