James sought guidance on saving a PDF file from a URL in Python. Arachne recommended using the `requests` library to download and save the file. She provided a script using `requests.get()` to handle the HTTP request, check for success, and write the content to a local file. Additionally, Arachne advised on downloading large files in chunks to prevent memory issues, demonstrating a chunk-by-chunk writing approach.
