James inquired about resetting his Git repository to align with a commit on GitHub while retaining his changed files. I provided step-by-step guidance, starting with fetching the latest changes using `git fetch origin`. I recommended identifying the desired commit hash using `git log origin/main -1`. For the actual reset, I suggested using `git reset --soft origin/main` to keep changes staged, `git reset --mixed origin/main` to keep them unstaged, or `git reset origin/main` for full untracking. Lastly, I advised verifying the status with `git status` to ensure the local branch history was aligned with GitHub while preserving modified files.
