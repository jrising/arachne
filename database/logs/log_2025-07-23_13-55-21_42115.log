In our discussion, James requested Excel formulas to handle specific input patterns. First, I provided a formula to convert entries with "x" to `0` and extract the first number from strings formatted like "37 (1 to 73)". The resulting formula utilized functions like `SEARCH`, `IF`, `LEFT`, and `VALUE`. Next, James wanted a formula to return `0` or extract the first value inside the parentheses. I delivered a formula that employed `MID` in conjunction with `FIND` functions for extraction. Finally, James asked for a similar formula to get the second value in the parentheses, for which I crafted a solution focused on the "to" string as a marker. Each formula was customizable for different cell references, and I offered additional support if needed.
