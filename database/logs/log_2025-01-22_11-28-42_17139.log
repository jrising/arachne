The conversation centered on James's grant proposal regarding the economic and fiscal risks of climate damage in the UK, as outlined in a comprehensive scoping document. Key discussions included a hybrid approach to modeling UK climate damage scenarios using existing sector models within a macroeconomic framework like NiGEM. The proposal aims to elucidate macroeconomic impacts, fiscal implications, and benefits of adaptation strategies, particularly in light of data gaps and limitations of current models. An initial six-month phase was proposed to integrate climate damage evidence into macroeconomic frameworks, succeeded by a deeper inquiry into adaptation costs. The outcome included drafting a "Theory of Change and Strategy" section aimed at guiding the proposed work, ensuring relevance, improving the evidence base on adaptation, and fostering collaboration among government and academic experts.
