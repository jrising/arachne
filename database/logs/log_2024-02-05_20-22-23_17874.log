James reached out for help with installing a heavy shelf on a drywall wall. Arachne provided guidance on alternative solutions to self-driving drywall anchors, which were causing the drywall to rip. Arachne suggested using a stud and screwing directly into it for a more secure hold. If studs were not available, toggle bolts or molly bolts were recommended, as they distribute the weight across a larger area. Additionally, Arachne advised pre-drilling a hole slightly smaller than the anchor and cautioned against applying too much pressure when installing the anchor.
