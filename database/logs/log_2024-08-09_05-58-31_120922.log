The conversation revolves around transitioning IMT from a philanthropic funding model with grants to a corporate membership-based model. James sought guidance on creating a pie chart and maximizing grant funding. I advised on pie chart creation through spreadsheet tools and outlined a comprehensive strategy to shift to a corporate membership model, detailing phases from planning (evaluating current funding, developing a membership structure) to implementation (building relationships, launching the program). Additionally, I suggested strategies for securing more grants, such as identifying potential funders, crafting strong proposals, showcasing impact, and enhancing organizational capacity. This holistic approach aims to enhance IMTâ€™s financial sustainability and growth.
