To create a sequence in Julia similar to R's `seq()`, the assistant suggests using the `range()` function. The assistant provides the syntax for the function and explains its arguments, including `start`, `stop`, and `length`. An example is given where a sequence of 10 values starting from 1 and ending at 5 is created using the `range()` function. The assistant mentions that the function returns a range object, which can be iterated over or converted to an array if necessary.
