In a conversation with James's 3-year-old son, Austin, I engaged him by acknowledging his interests, such as Sesame Street, dragons, and pirates. I initiated the dialogue by asking Austin about something fun he did that day, encouraging him to relate it to his favorite characters. The tone was friendly and inviting, aiming to foster connection and curiosity in young Austin while keeping the exchange brief and engaging.
