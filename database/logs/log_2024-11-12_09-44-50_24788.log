This conversation revolves around James Rising's recent publication, "Seaside to Statewide: The Economic Contributions of Delaware's Coastal Region," co-authored with Caitlin Wilson. The discussion includes revisions to promotional materials incorporating significant insights from their research. Key findings indicate the coastal economy's remarkable growth—5x faster than Delaware's overall economy since 2011—supporting 104,540 jobs and generating $820 million in tax revenue. Additionally, for every $100 of revenue in the coastal region, an extra $59 is yielded statewide, totaling $8.3 billion annually. The conversation emphasizes the importance of managing coastal risks, like flooding, which benefits the entire state, highlighting the need for state or regional approaches to these challenges.
