Governments frequently utilize Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models for economic forecasting, employing them to assess the impact of policy changes and economic shocks on variables like consumption, investment, employment, and inflation. Despite controversy surrounding their oversimplification of real-world economies, DSGE models offer a valuable framework for studying macroeconomic dynamics and policy effects. In Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, changes to exogenous parameters are categorized as "shocks" or "scenarios." Shocks represent specific alterations to external parameters, while scenarios involve a more comprehensive range of changes. Simulating these shocks and scenarios provides policymakers and analysts with insight into the potential consequences of policy decisions and external events, enabling the evaluation of various strategies for achieving economic objectives.
