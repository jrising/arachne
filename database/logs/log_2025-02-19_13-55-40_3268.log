Title**: Clarifying the Use and Application of the Social Cost of Carbon in Climate Impact Analysis

**Objective**: This review aims to clarify the usage and application of the social cost of carbon (SCC) in climate impact analysis, addressing common misconceptions and promoting proper utilization among researchers and policymakers.

**Introduction**: The SCC is significant for understanding climate impacts; however, it is often misused or misinterpreted in various studies. This review seeks to rectify those misunderstandings.

**Structure/Outline**:
- **Evolution of SCC Estimates**: Overview of key methodologies and updates over time.
- **Current Applications**: Insights into how SCC is applied in climate research and policy, noting prevalent pitfalls.
- **Guidance for Proper Use**: Best practices for using SCC effectively in research and policy contexts.
- **Future Trends and Developments**: Speculation on emerging methodologies and policy implications related to SCC.

**Potential Co-Authors**: To be determined; I will outline their contributions as the project develops.

**Bibliography/Key References**: A curated list of foundational works on SCC.

**Estimated Length and Timeline**: Anticipating a length of 3,000 - 5,000 words, with a synopsis completion suggested by the end of February and full draft submission aimed for 8-9 months later.

I welcome feedback and suggestions from the editorial team to enhance my proposal.
