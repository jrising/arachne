The conversation focused on comparing the advantages of membership-based models versus philanthropic funding for NGOs. The membership-based model provides a stable revenue stream, enhances stakeholder engagement, and offers ideological independence, promoting loyalty and long-term planning. In contrast, philanthropic funding presents large funding potential, access to expertise and networking opportunities, and project-specific funding that can drive rapid growth and validation. It was concluded that NGOs can benefit from employing both models, allowing for a balanced approach tailored to their specific context, mission, and strategy.
