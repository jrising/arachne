The order of predictors in an ANOVA generally does not matter, as ANOVA tests each predictor's significance independently. However, in hierarchical or stepwise regression analyses, the order of predictors can affect the final model and its interpretation. It is important to define a clear research question and hypothesis before conducting any statistical analysis to select and order predictors in a meaningful way.
