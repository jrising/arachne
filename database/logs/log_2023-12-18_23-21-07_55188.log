In a previous conversation, James asked about the administrative units in China for several cities and provinces. Arachne provided a breakdown of the administrative divisions and explained the categorization in China. Beijing and Tianjin are direct-controlled municipalities, with provincial-level status and reporting directly to the central government. Hubei, Guangdong, Fujian, and Sichuan are provinces of China. Shanghai is also a direct-controlled municipality and the largest city in China by population. Shenzhen is a sub-provincial city within Guangdong Province. Chongqing is another direct-controlled municipality. Arachne offered to provide additional information if needed.
