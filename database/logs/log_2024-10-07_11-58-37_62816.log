James asked about an economic survey technique for gauging people's valuation of options, specifically in the context of lower-income consumers considering EVs and the proximity of charging stations. I clarified that he was likely referring to "conjoint analysis," a survey-based method that helps understand how different product attributes impact consumer decision-making. This technique would be beneficial to analyze how lower-income consumers value factors like charging station proximity compared to cost and range. While James mentioned "hedonic pricing," I explained that it wouldnâ€™t fit his context as well as conjoint analysis, affirming the latter as the appropriate tool for his research needs.
