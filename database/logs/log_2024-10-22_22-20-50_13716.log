In the discussion, James inquired about the field that focuses on policy-making under uncertainty. I responded by identifying "Decision Science" or "Decision Analysis" as the relevant field. I explained that it is multidisciplinary, encompassing economics, statistics, psychology, and operations research to tackle complex decisions influenced by uncertainty. I also mentioned specific frameworks like "Robust Decision Making" and "Adaptive Policy-Making," which are important in creating effective policies in uncertain environments, such as climate change.
