James inquired about an example of a non-repeating sequence that demonstrates Kolmogorov Complexity. I provided the sequence of prime numbers as a fitting example, highlighting that while the sequence is infinite and non-repeating, the algorithm to generate it is straightforward. The steps of the algorithm were outlined to illustrate its simplicity contrasted with the complexity of the sequence itself. I also offered to share more about implementation or delve deeper into Kolmogorov Complexity if James was interested.
