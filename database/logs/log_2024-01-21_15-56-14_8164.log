In this conversation, James asked how to clip out an object from an image in Adobe Illustrator. The AI assistant provided step-by-step instructions on how to create an outline around the object using the Pen Tool and then create a clipping mask to remove the surrounding image. James then asked if he needed to copy the image into Illustrator again to extract other objects. The AI assistant explained that he can reuse the clipping mask by duplicating it and then editing the clipping path to fit around the new object. This allows for efficient extraction of multiple objects from the same image without the need to copy the entire image again.
