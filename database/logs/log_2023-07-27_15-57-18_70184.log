In the previous conversation, James sought advice on choosing a tool for teaching system dynamics modeling. The assistant suggested considering alternatives to Vensim, such as Stella, InsightMaker, and AnyLogic, which offer different features and interfaces to suit specific needs. The assistant emphasized the importance of considering the focus of the class and the computer literacy of the students. James then inquired about the specific feature of an "out of the system cloud symbol" in Vensim, which is used to represent external flows. The assistant informed James that InsightMaker does not have that specific symbol but explained that flows can still be modeled effectively in InsightMaker by connecting them directly to stocks using arrows or links, labeling them to clarify their external origin. The assistant assured James that InsightMaker allows for the representation and modeling of external inflows and outflows.
