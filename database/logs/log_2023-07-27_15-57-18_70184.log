James, a long-time user of Vensim, is considering whether it is still the right tool for teaching system dynamics modeling. Arachne suggests exploring other options such as Stella, InsightMaker, and AnyLogic, which offer different features and interfaces. The decision should be based on the specific needs of the class and the students' computer literacy. James then asks if InsightMaker has a specific symbol for flows into or out of stocks that do not come from other stocks, and Arachne explains that InsightMaker does not have a dedicated symbol but provides alternative ways to model external inflows and outflows.
