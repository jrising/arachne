The conversation started with a question from James about how to send multiple AJAX requests in JavaScript with jQuery and execute a function once all the requests are done. Arachne explained that this can be achieved using jQuery's `$.when()` method and provided an example code snippet. Arachne also highlighted some considerations such as server load, user experience, error handling, and browser limitations. James then asked how to handle an unknown number of requests. Arachne explained that the `arguments` object can be used within the `done` callback to access the results dynamically, and provided another code example that demonstrates how to handle an unknown number of requests using `$.when()` and the `arguments` object. The conversation concluded with Arachne encouraging James to make decisions that are appropriate for his specific use case.
