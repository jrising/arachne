In a previous conversation, James inquired about how to consolidate 36 Excel files named `savedrecs1.xls` through `savedrecs36.xls` into a single pandas DataFrame using Python. I provided a step-by-step guide that included importing the necessary `pandas` library, reading each Excel file in a loop, and appending the resulting DataFrames to a list. I then explained how to concatenate the list into one DataFrame with `pd.concat()`, offering verification steps to ensure the data combined correctly. I encouraged James to ask further questions if he needed additional help with specifics or operations.
