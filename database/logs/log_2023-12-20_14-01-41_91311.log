The conversation included an analysis of two motivation letters for Ph.D. applications. The first applicant expressed their interest in a Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics to contribute to sustainable poverty reduction and agricultural value enhancement in Ethiopia. The second applicant applied for a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics, with research interests in environmental and energy economics, policy, urban policy, and econometrics. They had research experience in econometrics and had co-authored a journal article on environmental science. The synthesized table summarized the applicants' faculty mentions, research interests, research proposals, quantitative capacity, UD specificity, writing fluency, growth potential, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) considerations. The table highlighted specific keywords from the rubric, such as research interests, motivation, methodology, published work, statistical skills, and programming skills.
