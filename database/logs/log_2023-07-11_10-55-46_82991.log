Dr. James Rising is conducting a research study titled "DNREC Information Gaps Analysis" funded by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. The study aims to understand how individuals, community organizations, and companies use the waters of Delaware's ocean and bay, and the types of information they rely on for ocean and bay-related activities. Participants will be asked to respond to structured questions for approximately 15 minutes in an online survey or 30 minutes to an hour in an in-person, phone, or video conference interview. Participation is voluntary, and all responses will be kept confidential. The email provides a template for inviting potential participants, explaining the study, emphasizing confidentiality, and providing a Consent Form for more information.
