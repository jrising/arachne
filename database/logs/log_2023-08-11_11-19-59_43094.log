The question posed by James was which session would be most appropriate for submitting a paper on the impacts of climate change on fisheries. The first session, CC005, explores the ecological responses of estuarine, coastal, and open ocean waters to climatic drivers. The second session, F001, focuses on emerging and innovative technologies for sustainable fisheries management. While the first session has a good title it doesn't directly address fisheries, whereas the second session specifically mentions climate change on fisheries. The assistant advised that the second session would be most appropriate since it discusses the impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquatic productions. Additionally, the emphasis on the practical applications of research to policy implementation and sustainable development aligns well with the objectives of the conference.
