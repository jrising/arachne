In a previous conversation on 2025-03-26, James inquired about appropriate adjectives to describe worn-out slaves in historical fiction. I responded with a list of ten adjectives, including "exhausted," "haggard," and "depleted," emphasizing the importance of sensitivity and nuance in portraying the harsh realities of their lives. I highlighted the necessity of respecting their humanity and individuality, advising against language that could dehumanize or objectify their experiences. The discussion underscored the balance between authenticity and respect in writing about such a challenging topic.
