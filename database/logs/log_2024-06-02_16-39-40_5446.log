James sought help in implementing a timeout for each feed when collecting data using concurrent.futures in Python. Initially, the global timeout issue with `as_completed` was addressed by suggesting the use of `future.result(timeout=10)` for individual timeouts. Subsequently, the challenge of serial results due to sequential timeouts was resolved by utilizing `concurrent.futures.wait()` to handle timeouts concurrently. When James inquired about timeouts occurring prematurely, it was clarified that timeouts were intended for feeds exceeding 10 seconds. Finally, a modification was proposed to enforce a 10-second timeout for each future by tracking start times and calculating remaining timeouts. The discussions aimed to optimize feed collection efficiency while ensuring no feed blocks the process indefinitely.
