In the previous conversation, James asked how to repeatedly call an Ajax command until the response indicates to stop. The assistant provided a solution using a recursive function in jQuery. The assistant shared a code example that demonstrates how to implement the recursive function, where the Ajax call is made within the function and the function is reinvoked based on a condition in the response. The assistant also advised including error handling and maximum retry limits to prevent potential issues. Additionally, the assistant mentioned that the nature of Ajax is asynchronous, but provided information on how to make it synchronous if necessary.
