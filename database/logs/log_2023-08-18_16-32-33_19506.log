The marine planning area currently under consideration does not have any active aquaculture operations. However, nearby in the bay north of the planning area, there are existing aquaculture operations in New Jersey waters. These operations involve a variety of aquatic organisms and have been derived from multiple state websites. It is important to note that certain states, such as Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana, and Mississippi, are not included in the dataset. In addition to these operations, Shellfish Aquaculture Development Areas (SADA) have been designated within the inland bay area. These areas have expedited state and federal permitting processes, making them potential sites for future aquaculture expansion. Regulations are in place to ensure that any shellfish aquaculture industry within Delaware's Inland Bays is compatible with other activities such as fishing, boating, and public safety. If the necessary conditions and requirements are met, there is a potential for aquaculture operations to expand into the marine planning area in the future, contributing to the growth and diversification of the local fishing industry.
