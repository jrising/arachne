James proposed a story premise involving a Wiccan coven inspired by interactions with Native Americans, focusing on women accused during the Salem Witch Trials. He sought to identify potential Wiccans among the accused and to connect the narrative to the 1650s or 1660s. I noted that while Wicca, as understood today, didn't exist then, he could creatively weave historical elements. I suggested characters like Tituba, Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, Martha Carrier, and Bridget Bishop as potential figures for his story. Each character offered an opportunity to explore marginalized spiritual practices. Furthermore, I recommended creating a fictional character who engages with Native Americans, providing a cultural link that educates and connects with the accused witches, enriching the narrativeâ€™s backdrop of early American spirituality and societal tensions.
