In a previous conversation, James sought advice on modeling energy prices at a high-resolution basis while capturing their burstiness. Arachne suggested several methods: GARCH models for modeling volatility clustering, ARIMA/SARIMA models with exogenous variables to capture trends and seasonality, state-space models and Kalman filtering for complex non-linear processes, machine learning approaches for constructing features from historical price data, hybrid models combining different methods, and agent-based modeling to simulate individual market participant behavior. Arachne emphasized the importance of iterative model selection and testing based on the specific data and problem context to find the most suitable model.
