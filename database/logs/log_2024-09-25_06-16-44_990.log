In our discussion, you explored the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), particularly its role in benefiting low-income and disadvantaged communities through building decarbonization efforts such as energy efficiency programs, affordable clean energy, job training, and local clean transportation. Additionally, we delved into the workings of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) with respect to commercial real estate finance, energy, environmental, and building infrastructure sectors. IMT's focus includes promoting energy efficiency, advocating for sustainability in market financing, and improving building operations. Finally, we covered various national and state policies related to energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction, such as the Clean Power Plan, California's AB 32, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and New York City's Local Law 97, emphasizing their impact on climate goals and energy standards.
