In a previous conversation, James asked how to find and mount an external hard drive on his Linux machine. Arachne provided detailed steps, including using commands like `lsblk` and `fdisk`, to find the drive and then mount it to a desired directory. In a follow-up response, James mentioned that he already found the drive at `/mnt/423808E91650DDB1` and wanted to mount it automatically on startup. Arachne suggested modifying the `/etc/fstab` file to achieve this, explaining the necessary format for a new entry in the file. Arachne also provided guidance on creating a symlink to the mounted drive. The synopsis concludes with Arachne offering further assistance if needed.
