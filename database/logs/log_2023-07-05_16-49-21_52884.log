The assistant synthesized an outline for James's introduction section of his external dossier for academic tenure. The outline includes sections on professional development and academic journey, department introduction and role, introduction to research and ongoing work, research achievements and highlights, teaching and academic service, academic leadership and service, future vision and goals, and a conclusion. James can now fill in the outline with his own experiences and contributions, tailored to his interdisciplinary environmental economist background. The assistant encouraged James to provide specific examples to showcase the breadth and depth of his work and to highlight the societal and environmental relevance of his research.
