In a conversation about rewriting passages for clarity and impact, James requested revisions for two statements. The first statement, regarding IMT's staff experience with administration changes, was rewritten to emphasize the need for a new, innovative approach to climate equity. The second statement focused on initial interactions with leaders in various sectors, highlighting their enthusiasm for advancing building performance policies. This was reformulated to stress the importance of partnerships in ensuring community engagement in building-focused climate policy, while underscoring the necessity of support from others to achieve these goals.
