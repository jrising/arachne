The section of the report provided discusses the construction of an Undersea Electricity Transmission Hub and Subsea High-voltage Transmission Line called the Atlantic Wind Connection (AWC). The hub is designed to transport marine-based renewable energy to shore, potentially connecting up to 7,000 MW of power through HVDC transmission lines. It aims to minimize disruptions by making few landings on shore. The hub's connection points are specified as Indian River in southern Delaware, along with other relevant connection points in Maryland and New Jersey. The report does not mention the current status of construction. Additionally, multiple small substation points are identified for small-scale development projects generating between 50 to 100 MW of power. The report does not provide specific details on the current status of these projects. Stakeholders include the Atlantic Wind Connection, Trans-Elect, Atlantic Grid Development, and potentially the governments of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey.
