The section of the report discusses the construction of an undersea electricity transmission hub and subsea high-voltage transmission line called the Atlantic Wind Connection (AWC). The hub is intended to transport marine-based renewable energy to the shore, with connection points in Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey. It aims to minimize disruptions and seafloor disturbance by making few landings on shore. The report also mentions the utilization of small substation points for small-scale development. The current status of both activities is not specified, but there is potential for expansion as offshore wind projects grow. Stakeholders include the AWC project owners, Trans-Elect, Atlantic Grid Development, and potentially the governments of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey. The information is sourced from the AWC's 2011 documents.
