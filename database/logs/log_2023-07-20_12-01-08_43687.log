Abdulbaki Teniola Ubandawaki, a research assistant and MSc student of sustainable development, reached out to inquire about the possibility of Ph.D. supervision for their fall 2024 Ph.D. environmental economics application at the University of Delaware. 

James Rising, responding, commended Abdulbaki's research experience and performance. James identified the Ph.D. Program in Environmental Economics as a strong fit for Abdulbaki's interests and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling background. Funding constraints were mentioned, and Abdulbaki was encouraged to apply in time for Fall admission to be considered for available funds. James emphasized the importance of refining research ideas and articulating their contribution to the field of Environmental Economics and practical environmental policy and sustainable development. The email closed with an invitation to further discuss Abdulbaki's research and potential future enrollment at the University of Delaware.
