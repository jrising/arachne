James asked about a more efficient way to read a TSV file directly into a matrix in R, instead of using `read.delim` followed by `as.matrix`. Arachne recommended using the lower-level `scan` function to read the data into a vector and then reshape it into a matrix using the `matrix` function. Arachne provided a code snippet for this process and highlighted the need to transpose the matrix if required. While `scan` can be faster, it may be less error-tolerant than `read.delim`. The advice emphasized verifying data integrity after using `scan` for reading files.
