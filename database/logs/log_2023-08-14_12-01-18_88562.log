The discussion centered around the completion of the "Statement of Project Objectives" (SOPO) document for the grant proposal to DOE titled "Enabling Multi-disciplinary Pathways in Offshore Wind Education and Research (EMPOWER)". The focus was on the Community Benefits Plan (CBP) and how it addresses diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, accessibility, energy equity, and environmental justice. The objectives for Budget Period 1 were revised to include the identification and engagement of specific communities falling within the targeted groups of underprivileged communities and those highly dependent on the ocean economy or offshore wind. The objective for Budget Period 2 was expanded to include mobilizing workforce programs, fostering collaborative relationships with communities, conducting environmental impact studies, and introducing performance measures to assess the effectiveness of the CBP. The aim was to ensure sustainable and equitable development, maximize community benefits, and facilitate the transition to a renewable future while building sustainable and inclusive communities.
