Arachne provided a mapping of disciplines mentioned on CVs to corresponding categories in a survey of earned doctorates. She categorized each CV field into broader disciplines where possible, aligning disciplines such as Accountancy with Business administration and Anthropology with Anthropology. This mapping aimed to connect specific CV disciplines like Biochemistry and Behavioral Decision Research to broader fields like Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology and Psychology, respectively. The process facilitated a clearer understanding of the diverse academic backgrounds presented in the CVs by aligning them with established academic categories.
