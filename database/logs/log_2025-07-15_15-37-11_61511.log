James presented a table from his paper containing various climate models and their methodologies, indicating a reviewer's comment requesting the definition of the acronyms used. I provided a condensed list of the acronyms, including definitions for 15 terms like “FUND Model,” “GIVE Model,” and “GCM.” Additional acronyms explained were “ECS,” “RCP,” and regional classifications such as “NUTS2” and “ADM3.” I offered to clarify any specific terms if needed, ensuring James had thorough definitions for addressing the reviewer's feedback.
