In a previous conversation, James Rising received an email from Javad Teymoori, a master's student interested in applying for a Ph.D. position at the University of Delaware for Fall 2025. Javad detailed his research experiences in hydrological modeling, climate modeling, and machine learning applications in his field. James requested assistance in drafting a professional response to Javad. In the email, James expressed gratitude for Javad's interest, acknowledged his impressive background, but regrettably informed him that there were no available PhD slots for Fall 2025. He encouraged Javad to explore other opportunities and offered a Zoom meeting link for further discussion.
