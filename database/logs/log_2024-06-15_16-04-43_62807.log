James was working on a project to track and offset companies' social and environmental impacts based on user purchases. The project involved database setup, but faced challenges in evaluating companies and obtaining purchase information. Steps suggested included completing scaffolding for companies, creating user accounts, automating data collection, integrating donation features, and ensuring regular maintenance. Practical next steps involved user authentication, purchase tracking, data parsing development, donation integration research, and custom report creation. Overall, improving these aspects would move the project closer to a usable state.
