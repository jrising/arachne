The discussion centered around the explanation of AVX and SSE, which are instruction sets for managing data in modern computer processors. SSE is a SIMD instruction set introduced by Intel in 1999, while AVX is another SIMD instruction set extension for the x86 architecture announced by Intel in 2008. Both instruction sets improve performance in multimedia tasks, such as 3D graphics and video encoding, as well as in high-performance computing and machine learning applications.
