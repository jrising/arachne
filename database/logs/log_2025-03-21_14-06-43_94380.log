James inquired about approximations for the expression \(\sum_i (x_i - y_i)^2\) without knowing \(\sum_i x_i y_i\), but having access to the totals of \(x_i^2\) and \(y_i^2\). I explained how to decompose it into three sums and suggested expressing it as \(S_x + S_y - 2\sum_i x_iy_i\), emphasizing that without \(\sum_i x_iy_i\), further reduction wasn't possible. James clarified he wanted to drop certain terms, similar to the variance formula, leading to an approximation that considers the means of \(x\) and \(y\). I provided a revised expression incorporating variances while neglecting the cross-term, asserting that this holds best under minimal correlation between \(x\) and \(y\).
