In a conversation, James Rising detailed a paper focusing on the "Drivers of the Country-Level Social Cost of Carbon" using an advanced integrated assessment model, PAGE-2020. He presented key advancements including a mapping of climate uncertainty, dynamic vulnerability in GDP-based damages, calibration of abatement costs, and accounting for subnational damage distributions. The paper aims to provide estimates of damages across time and geopolitical scenarios while evaluating the distribution of the social cost of carbon (SCCOâ‚‚) amid uncertainty. The discussion emphasized the importance of spatial resolution in understanding climate impacts and the necessity of integrating equity considerations into climate policy frameworks. An academic abstract summarizing these points was then crafted to capture the paper's essence for submission to a climate change economics journal.
