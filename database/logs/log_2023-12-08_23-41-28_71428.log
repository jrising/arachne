In a previous conversation, James asked about the maximum speed of a ship like the whaling ship Essex. The assistant explained that ships like the Essex were not designed for speed but for durability and capacity. The average long-distance speed of a whaling ship like the Essex would likely have been around 6-8 knots, although early 19th-century sailing ships could reach speeds up to 10 knots in ideal wind conditions. The assistant clarified that a ship's speed is relative to the surrounding water, not the speed of the wind. Achieving the maximum speed of a sailing ship depends on factors like wind direction, strength, ship design, crew skill, and ship condition. The assistant also noted that a ship typically requires a wind speed higher than its desired boat speed to achieve forward motion, and ships like the Essex were optimized for endurance rather than speed.
