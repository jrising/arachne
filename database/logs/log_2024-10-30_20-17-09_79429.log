In a series of communications, Onyinyechi Aghanwa expressed her desire to pursue a PhD in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware, outlining her academic background and research interests in climate change impacts. James Rising responded positively, indicating that her interests align with his research but noted limited ability to influence fee waivers for applications due to economic hardship. To assist Onyinyechi, he suggested contacting the admissions office regarding fee waivers. Additionally, he offered a **Program Interest Form** as a free alternative to a full application, allowing her to express her academic goals and aspirations without incurring costs. He encouraged her to fill out the form for better guidance on her application process.
