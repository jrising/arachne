The conversation began with Abdullah Al Maruf expressing his interest in James Rising's research on modeling social-environmental systems and applying for graduate studies in Fall '25. He detailed his background, research experience, and projects in sustainable aquaculture. James responded positively, directing him to a form to clarify his program alignment. Abdullah confirmed he submitted the form and remained eager to work with James. However, James later asked about Abdullah's citizenship status related to funding eligibility, which Abdullah clarified he misunderstood. Ultimately, James informed Abdullah that there was no available funding from university resources, encouraging him to pursue external financial options. James offered a Zoom chat for further discussion, promoting ongoing communication.
