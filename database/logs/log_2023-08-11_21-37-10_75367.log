The identified activities in this section of the report are shipping traffic, offshore wind energy development, and anchorage. Shipping traffic involves the movement of commercial vessels in designated Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs), with potential conflicts with offshore wind projects. Offshore wind energy development is the proposed and ongoing development of wind installations in designated lease blocks. Anchorage refers to the use of areas adjacent to TSS shipping lanes as anchorage grounds for ships waiting to enter or exit the Delaware Bay and River. Stakeholders include BOEM, USCG, shipping companies, wind energy developers, port authorities, and environmental organizations. Spatial planning using tools like the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data can help determine suitable wind development sites. The status, spatial extent, temporal patterns, potential expansion/changes, and sources are detailed for each activity.
