In this conversation, James Rising responded to a PhD student, Xin Wen, regarding challenges with optimizing the MimiFUND/DICE model using the Julia language. Wen initially struggled with optimizing a temperature constraint and finding an initial point for the MIU parameter. James advised creating a new component for parameters and using the "paramtrans" option for problem definition. The discussion evolved as Wen detailed issues with stricter constraints affecting initial solution finding, observing that looser constraints allowed for solutions. James suggested utilizing the solution from a less restrictive constraint as an initial point for tighter constraints and offered to discuss further via Zoom.
