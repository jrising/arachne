James asked for a more tactful way to describe something that was essentially laughable due to the obviousness of the comparison. I suggested phrases like "surprisingly unsubtle," "remarkably straightforward," "charmingly obvious," and "delightfully clear-cut" to convey the simplicity without being harsh or dismissive. The discussion focused on finding gentle language to address the clarity in a comparison.
