James asked how to find the minimum value in a column specified by a cell containing a column label. The solution involved using the `INDIRECT`, `MATCH`, and `ADDRESS` functions in Google Sheets to dynamically reference and calculate the minimum value based on the column label provided. The formula constructed the range based on the column label and then used the `MIN` function to identify the minimum value in that column.
