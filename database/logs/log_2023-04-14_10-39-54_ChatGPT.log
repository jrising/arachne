James asked for a recommendation for the title of a session on recent advances in the estimation of the social cost of carbon for the ASSA annual meeting. Arachne suggested the title "Innovative Approaches to Estimating the Social Cost of Carbon: New Perspectives and Methodologies." James then asked about appropriate JEL classifications for the session, and Arachne provided a list of classifications covering environmental economics, policy, welfare economics, and evaluation of public projects.
