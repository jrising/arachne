In a previous conversation, James inquired about the dangerous wave height for a 19th century 3-mast ship, like the whaler Essex. Arachne provided information based on the size and shape of the ship, explaining that while it was stable in open water, it could still be vulnerable to extreme sea conditions. Generally, vessels of this size range experienced difficulty in wave heights over 5-6 meters (16-20 feet), and conditions could be considered dangerous when wave heights exceeded 8-10 meters (26-33 feet). Arachne also mentioned that experienced crews and captains used seamanship techniques and deployed drogues to navigate through such conditions. Additionally, Arachne highlighted the risk posed by rogue waves, which are unexpected and can exceed 20-30 meters (65-100 feet). She emphasized that other factors such as wave period, wind speed and direction, visibility, temperature, currents, ship condition, and crew experience also contribute to the actual danger experienced at sea.
