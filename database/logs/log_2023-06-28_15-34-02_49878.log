In a previous conversation, James asked about the most common language in Senegal and Nigeria. I explained that while Senegal's most common language is Wolof, French is the official language and widely used. In Nigeria, English is the official language, but Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo are also widely spoken. James then asked about the most common language in West Africa in general. I informed him that French is the most common language in West Africa, due to French colonization in countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast. English is also widely spoken, especially in countries under British colonization. I mentioned the rich linguistic diversity of the region, with many indigenous languages spoken by different ethnic groups.
