James sought help regarding a Python script that functions correctly in a file but fails while using `eval`, encountering an error where `text_combined` is undefined. I explained that `eval` is not designed for executing full scripts and suggested using `exec` instead, as it can handle complete code structures including imports and loops. I provided a modified version of his script designed for execution with `exec`, ensuring it retains its original functionality while addressing the error encountered.
