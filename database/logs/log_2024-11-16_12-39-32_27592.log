James received an email from the European Society of Medicine inviting him to collaborate on a COVID-19 project, referencing his article on "Weather drives variation in COVID-19 transmission and detection." The editor suggested he contribute to a special theme issue in their official journal. In response, James expressed appreciation for the editor's interest but clarified that he currently has no planned work in that area. He offered to discuss potential collaboration and included a link to schedule a Zoom meeting for a more in-depth conversation.
