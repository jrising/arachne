In a previous conversation, James asked if he could use wave height and period data from NOAA buoys to estimate ocean current speeds. Arachne explained that wave properties are primarily determined by wind speed, duration, and fetch, and while waves can be influenced by currents, it's not straightforward to deduce current velocities from them. Arachne suggested that direct estimation of ocean current speeds typically requires specialized ocean current meters or satellite altimetry data. However, Arachne mentioned that data from NOAA's High Frequency Radar (HFR) might be useful, as it provides real-time surface current measurements over large coastal regions. Ocean current velocities from HFR are available along with meteorological and oceanographic data from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center.
