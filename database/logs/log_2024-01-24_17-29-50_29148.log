The current version of the PAGE-ICE model is a sophisticated and comprehensive tool for climate economics analysis and policy-making. It incorporates advancements in climate representation, including Arctic feedbacks and changes in sea ice and land snow albedo. The model operates on an annual timescale to capture weather variability and simulate potential climate impacts. It considers the partial persistence of economic damages due to climate change and captures the heterogeneous economic impact of non-market damages, sea level rise, and temporary discontinuity damages. The model incorporates costs of adaptation measures and uses Shared Socioeconomic Pathways to model a wide range of future emissions and socioeconomic scenarios. Damages are equity-weighted to account for global impacts and the model also includes abatement costs for evaluating policy alternatives. This user-friendly model provides a robust framework for understanding the climate-economy interface and guiding climate policy-making.
