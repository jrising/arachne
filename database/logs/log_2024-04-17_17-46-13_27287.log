James inquired about merging xarray datasets with different coordinate values into a single dataset labeled by each dataset's unique coordinate value. Arachne explained the process using Python code, advising to use `assign_coords()` to add new coordinates to each dataset and then concatenate them along the new coordinate axis 'ssp'. This method enables James to combine datasets such as 'SSP1', 'SSP2', etc., into a merged dataset efficiently.
