James inquired about the suitability of the term "deployed" in academic writing, wondering if "employed" or "applied" would be more appropriate. I explained that "deployed" connotes a strategic implementation, while "employed" and "applied" suggest general use or application. The choice depends on the level of intention or strategic thinking behind using the method. I advised James to consider the specific context and the nuance he wants to convey to determine the most fitting term for his co-author's sentence.
