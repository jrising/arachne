In a conversation with James, I provided information on adding a class to an element in jQuery using the `.addClass()` method. I explained how to add a single class as well as multiple classes at once. I also demonstrated how to add a class to all elements of a certain type or class. In response to James' follow-up question, I explained how to check if an element has a given class using the `.hasClass()` method. I provided an example code snippet for checking a single class and for checking multiple classes.
