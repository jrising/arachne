The discussion revolved around developing a methodology section for a report evaluating the economic contribution of Delaware's coastal area. The conversation covered subsections such as Study Region, Measuring Coastal Contribution, and Economic Modeling and Data. Specific details were provided on defining the study region, including coastal and inland areas, and selecting industries based on the 2012 report's methodology. The concept of direct, indirect, and induced effects in measuring coastal contribution was explained, along with examples of a seafood processing plant and a beachfront hotel. The use of the IMPLAN software for economic modeling and data analysis was also discussed.
