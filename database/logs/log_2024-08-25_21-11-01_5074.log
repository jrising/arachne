James inquired about applying a 10-year moving average to every column in a dataframe using `dplyr`. The solution involved using `mutate()` along with `across()` to efficiently implement the moving average calculation. Key steps included leveraging `cumsum()` for cumulative sums and a specific arithmetic expression to compute the moving average. The code assumed all columns were numeric, but adjustments could be made for dataframes containing non-numeric columns by targeting only numeric columns within `across()`.
