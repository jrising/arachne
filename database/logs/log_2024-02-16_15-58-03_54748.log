In a previous conversation, James asked if the data in IMPLAN's "Region Summary" is reported in the current year or the year the data was collected. Arachne explained that the data in the "Region Summary" is typically reported in the year it was collected, but IMPLAN performs adjustments to situate the data in a reference year through a procedure called "data aging" or "temporal interpolation." Arachne mentioned that the reference year can differ from the collection year and suggested checking the metadata or study information for the specific dataset to find the reference year. Arachne also advised contacting IMPLAN support for clarification if unsure, as they are usually responsive to inquiries.
