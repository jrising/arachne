James sought assistance in framing a "pitch competition" for the business engagement team to present compelling business cases for membership and investment in their programs, focusing on the DC Building Innovation Hub, Green Lease Leaders Platform, Network of Hubs, and Energy Tracker Database. I provided a detailed competition framework, including objectives, submission guidelines, evaluation criteria, and expected outcomes. James requested additional details and a timeline, including an internal pitch to staff followed by feedback from a board subcommittee. I incorporated these elements and structured the timeline into phases, detailing the internal pitch process, feedback collection from the subcommittee, business case refinement, final presentations, and awards evaluation. The overall goal is to cultivate innovation within the team and ultimately enhance program participation and investment aligned with sustainability goals.
