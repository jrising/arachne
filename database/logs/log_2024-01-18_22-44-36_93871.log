James received an email from Xiaodi Zhang, an Associate Professor and Associate Researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, expressing interest in becoming a visiting scholar in the field of Environmental Economics or participating in ongoing projects. Xiaodi's research aligns well with James' focus on climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. James responded, acknowledging Xiaodi's qualifications and encouraging him to apply to the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics or mention James in his statement of purpose or project proposals. James explained that funding is limited and advised Xiaodi to submit his application by the end of the year for better consideration for available funds. James also suggested Xiaodi reach out to Xinfeng Liang, who leads natural science programs at the School of Marine Science & Policy.
