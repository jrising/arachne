James sought to understand the ideological differences between Springfield and Hartford in the 17th century, particularly regarding grain sales rivalry. I explained that "ideological compatibility" referred to shared Puritan principles, with Springfield aligning with Massachusetts Bay Colony due to economic factors despite Connecticut's more democratic governance style. James also inquired about his ancestor's 1668 move from Salem, MA to the smaller town of Windsor, CT. I provided potential reasons for this relocation, including land opportunities, religious freedom, family presence, political factors, lifestyle preferences, and the desire for independence. I suggested further research into local records for deeper insights into his ancestor's decision.
