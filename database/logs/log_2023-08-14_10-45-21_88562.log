James asked about a simple example of a coupled human-natural system to start his course on "Coupling natural to human systems." Arachne provided an example of an uncoupled natural system, where the environment exists in its natural form without human activities, and an uncoupled human system, where humans live without significantly modifying the natural environment. Arachne then explained the concept of an urban heat island as an example of a coupled system, where cities develop and replace natural surfaces with urban materials, resulting in a localized increase in temperature. In the coupled system, both the human and natural systems shape each other's characteristics and dynamics.
