In a discussion about a grant proposal, the user sought assistance in articulating objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) for a set of work programs (WPs) involving climate and socio-economic scenario development. Initially, a detailed draft of objectives and KPIs was provided, but the user expressed a desire for more general objectives to avoid redundancy. Subsequently, objectives were reformulated based on scoping document insights, focusing on enhancing understanding of macroeconomic impacts, quantifying fiscal risks, informing adaptation spending decisions, facilitating timely decision-making, and supporting global capacity building. A relationship table correlated these objectives to specific tasks and included a column for KPIs, enhancing clarity and accountability in measuring project success.
