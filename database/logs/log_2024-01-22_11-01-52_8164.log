In a previous conversation, James asked how to list all variables in an xarray dataset. Arachne provided two methods: using the `keys()` method on the `data_vars` attribute and using `print(ds)`. James mentioned that when using `print(ds)`, some variables were missing due to truncation. Arachne explained that this happens when there are too many variables to fit in the console window and suggested changing the `expand_repr` option to `True` to display all variables. Arachne also cautioned that this may result in a large amount of output for datasets with many variables.
