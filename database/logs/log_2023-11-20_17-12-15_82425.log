James asked for assistance with normalizing weights in a dataset using `dplyr`. He was experiencing odd behavior when dealing with NAs in the weights. The AI explained that the issue was due to the use of the `ifelse` function, which doesn't handle row-wise conditions. The AI suggested using the `case_when` function instead and provided revised code for normalizing the weights. The revised code considered each weight individually and produced the expected output.
