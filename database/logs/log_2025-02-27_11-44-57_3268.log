James sought help with a Julia programming error related to filling missing data in a DataFrame. He encountered a `MethodError` indicating ambiguity in converting types, specifically when assigning a vector of `Union{Missing, Float64}` to a `Vector{Missing}`. I clarified that the issue stemmed from the destination column not being compatible with `Float64` values. To resolve the error, I suggested converting the entire `:cif_lost` column to `Union{Missing, Float64}` before performing the `coalesce` operation, ensuring that it could accept both `Missing` and `Float64` values. The proposed solution involved updating the column type to facilitate the assignment without errors.
