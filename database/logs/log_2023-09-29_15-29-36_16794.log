In a previous conversation, James asked how to estimate the kW potential of offshore wind based on average wind speed. Arachne provided a general procedure for estimating power generation using wind speed data and a wind turbine's power curve. James then asked for a simple approximate expression, to which Arachne provided a formula considering the power coefficient, swept area, and average wind speed. James inquired about the values for air density and the swept area, which Arachne provided as general approximations. Finally, James mentioned the need to account for spacing between turbines and asked about estimating the effective kW per kmÂ². Arachne explained how to calculate the effective power density by considering the area occupied by a single turbine and the total number of turbines within the area of interest. Arachne provided an example calculation and emphasized that actual power density may vary due to various factors.
