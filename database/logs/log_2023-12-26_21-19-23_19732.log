In a previous conversation, James sought advice on implementing his own random forest algorithm that handles both categorical and numerical columns. He proposed randomly selecting split points for numerical columns to reduce computational complexity. Arachne confirmed that this strategy could be effective in lowering complexity, but cautioned that it might lead to less accurate models compared to a normally implemented random forest. Arachne suggested a compromise solution of selecting sub-optimal split points based on quantiles, which strikes a balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy. Arachne also advised James to evaluate the reduction in accuracy by comparing the performance of his implementation with a full random forest on smaller datasets. Additionally, Arachne emphasized the importance of not pruning individual trees too aggressively to ensure overall performance.
