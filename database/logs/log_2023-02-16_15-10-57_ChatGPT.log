In a discussion about average land temperatures versus global mean temperatures, the AI explained that average land temperatures can be either warmer or cooler than the global mean temperature, depending on various factors. The global mean temperature is an estimate of the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, combining measurements from both land and ocean sources. Specific regions like deserts or urban areas with concrete and asphalt can experience significantly warmer temperatures, while high altitude areas or polar regions can be cooler. The AI also noted that the global mean temperature can change over time due to natural climate variability and human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions. Both land temperatures and the global mean temperature are subject to change over time.
