During the conversation, James asked about alternatives to the pixellated ESRI National Geographic base map in QGIS. The assistant provided three high-resolution alternatives: Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OpenStreetMap. The assistant also suggested using TileMill or Mapbox to create custom-styled base maps. The assistant emphasized the importance of setting the correct projection (CRS) for the project.
