In a previous conversation, James asked about finding a high-resolution base map in QGIS using the QuickMapServices plugin. The assistant explained that some maps, like the ESRI National Geographic map, can be low resolution due to technical limitations. The assistant suggested a few alternatives for higher resolution base maps, including Google Maps and Bing Maps, which offer high-resolution imagery. OpenStreetMap tiles were also mentioned as a free option with good resolution. Additionally, the assistant recommended considering tools like TileMill or Mapbox to create custom-styled base maps. Lastly, the assistant reminded James to set the correct projection for his project, as this can affect the appearance of pixelation in base maps.
