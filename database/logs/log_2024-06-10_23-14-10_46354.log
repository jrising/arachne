James sought advice on gift etiquette for a speaking engagement in Korea. The AI provided a detailed guide including the number of gifts (one for the project manager, one for a senior person, and extra for colleagues), suggested gift types (such as chocolates, local crafts, or stationery), price points ($20-$50 for main gifts, $10-$20 for smaller gifts), and cultural sensitivities (avoiding unlucky numbers and relationship symbolisms). The advice emphasized good presentation and personal touches like handwritten notes. James was encouraged to prepare 3-5 gifts of varying sizes to show thoughtfulness and cultural awareness, ensuring a successful and respectful visit.
