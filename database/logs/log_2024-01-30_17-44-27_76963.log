The discussion revolved around data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process, particularly in relation to biological data on different species groups. The synthesis integrated information from three reports, highlighting data gaps for marine mammals, birds, bats, sea turtles, and protected fish. The reports identified specific gaps in high-definition aerial imagery, eDNA data, wind turbine interactions, radar/lidar studies, seabird diet data, and specific types of data like ROV video data. The need for improved data collection, synthesis, and standardization processes was emphasized to support informed decision-making and enable more sustainable uses of marine resources in Delaware's Ocean and Bay. It was also noted that clear data ownership, timely publishing, and better documentation are crucial for fisheries management, species and habitat management, community resilience, and responsible siting for offshore renewable energy development.
