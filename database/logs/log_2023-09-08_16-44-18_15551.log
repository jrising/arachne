In a previous conversation, James inquired about the reason behind the orange color of Thai iced tea. Arachne explained that the distinctive hue comes from a special ingredient called "Nam-dang," a type of food coloring commonly used in Thai cuisine. Nam-dang is made from anatto seed, which gives it a natural reddish-orange shade. When mixed with strong black tea, condensed milk, and sugar, it produces the vibrant orange color that is characteristic of Thai iced tea.
