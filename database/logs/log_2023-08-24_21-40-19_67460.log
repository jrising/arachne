James inquired about obtaining employment data at the NAICS level with high resolution, specifically at the county level or finer. The assistant provided a step-by-step guide on how to proceed, including accessing the U.S. Census Bureau's County Business Patterns (CBP), ZIP Code Business Patterns (ZBP), Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) programs for relevant data. James then asked about finding 6-digit NAICS code information, to which the assistant clarified that the ZBP dataset does not provide that level of detail. Instead, the assistant suggested accessing the CBP dataset or checking with the BLS and state/local government websites. The assistant also emphasized the importance of consulting multiple sources for comprehensive and up-to-date information.
