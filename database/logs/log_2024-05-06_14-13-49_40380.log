In a discussion about geoengineering, James inquired about a term related to actors switching from supporting mitigation to favoring geoengineering. The term "moral hazard" was explained, highlighting concerns about reduced motivation for emission cuts. Later, James referenced the novel "Termination Shock," where actors, like fossil fuel companies, strategically shift to promoting geoengineering over mitigation, termed a "strategic flip." This shift raises worries about maintaining the status quo and prioritizing geoengineering over emission reductions.
