A detailed methodology for determining Pelagic Propagule Duration (PPD) across various marine species involves integrating and interpreting data from multiple sources on larval dynamics and propagule durations. Key steps include data preparation from diverse datasets, normalization of duration units using a specialized function, merging datasets systematically, resolving conflicts by prioritizing reliable sources, and generating comprehensive PPD estimates through hierarchical species-level lookup. The approach includes aggregating related duration values and providing a unified dataset for ecological modeling and research. Strengths lie in robust data handling, normalization, and hierarchical integration, supporting accurate analysis of species dispersal and marine connectivity.
