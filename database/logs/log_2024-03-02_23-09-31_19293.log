James inquired about the flow rate needed for 1.5 bathrooms. I explained that flow rate depends on the number and types of fixtures used simultaneously. Considering typical flow rates for fixtures like showers, faucets, and tubs, I estimated a need of 9 to 11 gallons per minute. Emphasized the importance of not overtaxing the system, consulting with experts, and considering additional appliances' flow rates for a more accurate assessment.
