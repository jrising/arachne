In the context of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE), MRV services involve Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification processes crucial for assessing the effectiveness and environmental impact of OAE activities. Monitoring includes data collection on seawater chemistry and CO₂ sequestration rates, while Reporting involves systematic documentation for stakeholders. Verification ensures data accuracy and transparency through independent reviews. These services are essential for responsibly implementing OAE to assess CO₂ removal efficacy and identify potential environmental impacts.
