James queried about reducing the size of a 2-page Word document, which remained 3 MB despite being shorter. I provided several strategies for size reduction: compressing images through the "Picture Format" tab; removing unused data via "Inspect Document"; changing the file format to PDF or a reduced-size DOCX; checking for embedded objects; using built-in optimization tools; and inspecting fonts to avoid embedding unnecessary font data. These steps aim to effectively decrease the document's size while preserving its content integrity. I invited him to reach out for clarification on any specific method.
