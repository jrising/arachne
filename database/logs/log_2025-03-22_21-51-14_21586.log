James inquired about indexing a vector in Julia with an array of type `Vector{Union{Int64, Missing}}`, specifically whether missing indices would propagate to produce missing outputs. I explained that while the default behavior does not allow for this, a custom function using a comprehension would achieve the desired effect. James then asked about the potential performance implications of this approach. I noted that while efficient for smaller datasets, performance could decrease with larger arrays due to overhead and memory allocation. I suggested exploring alternatives, such as `filter!`, `mapslices`, or utilizing packages like `NullableArrays.jl` or `Missings.jl`, and advised benchmarking the implementation for specific performance insights.
