This conversation covered the topic of calling async functions in JavaScript and awaiting the response to a Promise. The assistant explained that the `await` operator can be used within an `async` function to pause the code execution until the Promise is resolved. Two code examples were provided, one demonstrating the usage of `await` within an async function and another showing how to use an immediately invoked async function expression (IIFE) for using `await` at the top level of code. The IIFE approach is useful when working with script files and modules.
