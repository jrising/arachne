James sought to promote his new publication on social media and his lab website, requesting concise summaries for Fediscience/X, LinkedIn, an HTML block for his website, and a blog post. The discussion resulted in crafted content for each platform, including a tweet highlighting the study's focus on Nairobi's traffic congestion and equity implications, a LinkedIn announcement underscoring the research's significance, and a structured HTML block for his website that detailed the article.
