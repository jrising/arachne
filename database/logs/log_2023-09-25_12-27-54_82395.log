The rise in global food insecurity since 2014 can be attributed to conflict and political instability, climate change and extreme weather events, economic challenges and poverty, population growth and urbanization, and disruptions caused by pandemics and health emergencies. These factors interact and reinforce each other, creating complex challenges for ensuring global food security. Addressing food insecurity requires a comprehensive approach that integrates efforts to promote peace, sustainable agriculture, climate resilience, poverty reduction, and equitable access to food and resources.
