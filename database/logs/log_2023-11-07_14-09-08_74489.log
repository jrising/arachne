The proposed project aims to estimate the current macroeconomic losses from climate change for each country globally. The methodology section focuses on the machine learning aspect, where a random forest model is fitted for each country, year, and Monte Carlo draw using the DirectImpact data. Quality values ranging from 0 to 1 are assigned to attributes of the dataset based on their relevance and methodology used in the background research. These quality values help in selecting the model that represents the optimal prediction for the direct impact of climate change. The random forest model's output is used to determine the global population-weighted impact, which is visualized for better understanding. The approach ensures the integration of the most refined features from various papers, creating a comprehensive machine learning model for precise and reliable estimation of climate change impacts at a global scale.
