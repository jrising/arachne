The discussion focused on the classification of costs related to climate change adaptation infrastructure. James inquired whether costs could be divided into capital expenditures (capex) and operational expenditures (opex), to which I affirmed, explaining both terms. He then asked about broader adaptation projects involving non-capital expenses and barriers, prompting a comprehensive overview of incentives, training, public awareness, and various implementation barriers. I emphasized a holistic approach to budgeting, considering all expenses and stakeholder engagement. Finally, James questioned the terminology of "Capex + Opex + Non-Capital Expenses." I clarified these terms, suggesting "Additional Costs" to encompass a wider range of project-related expenses, thus facilitating clearer financial planning for adaptation initiatives.
