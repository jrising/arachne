He requested assistance in drafting a cover letter for a Sr. Manager, Growth Marketing position at Archive, a company promoting circular business models and second-hand shopping. I crafted a cover letter emphasizing Johanna's substantial experience in growth marketing, strategic partnerships, and data-driven initiatives, while aligning her background with Archive’s mission and organizational goals. The letter highlighted her achievements in fundraising and network expansion, illustrating her analytic approach and collaborative spirit, essential for a high-growth startup environment.
