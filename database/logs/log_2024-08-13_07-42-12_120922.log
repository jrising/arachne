James reported an error while trying to start MongoDB on his server, indicating a failed service due to "code=exited, status=14". I responded with troubleshooting steps, including testing the configuration file by running MongoDB directly, checking MongoDB logs for detailed error messages, ensuring correct file permissions and ownership of the storage path specified in the configuration, and verifying adequate storage space. I guided him through specific commands to inspect the configuration and storage status, encouraging further communication if issues persisted.
