The discussion explored the relationship between the Endangerment Finding and the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) in U.S. regulatory analysis. The Endangerment Finding, established by the EPA, legally identifies greenhouse gases as a threat, allowing for regulation under the Clean Air Act. Although it could be revoked by a new administration, this would require substantial scientific justification and could face judicial challenges. Circular A-4 relates to existing policies regarding regulatory analysis but does not explicitly mandate SCC use. Altering Circular A-4 significantly enough to eliminate the SCC would be complex due to the administrative process, institutional resistance, legal standards, and potential political repercussions. Overall, the conversation emphasized the intricacies of policy changes within environmental regulation.
