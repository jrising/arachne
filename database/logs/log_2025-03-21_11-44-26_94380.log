James inquired about translating R² values from a model using 5-year averages to those that would result from annual data. I explained the challenges of this translation, emphasizing that averaging data results in the loss of granularity, possibly inflating R² values by smoothing variability. Key points included the potential impact of temporal dynamics, the emphasis on trends, and the structure of the model affecting R². I suggested directly comparing R² values by implementing the model on annual data and recommended using simulations to empirically assess differences. Additionally, I noted that theoretical estimates would require complex statistical modeling to account for variance and autocorrelation.
