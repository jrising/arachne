The chapter discusses the concept of Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) and the need for sustainable development in the face of increased human impact on the environment. It emphasizes the reciprocal interactions and feedbacks between human and natural components, and proposes an integrated conceptual framework for understanding and studying CHANS. The chapter also applies the framework to a case study on coupled human and wildlife systems in rural forest settings, highlighting its adaptability. Overall, the concept and framework of CHANS provide a basis for addressing global sustainability challenges in the Anthropocene epoch.
