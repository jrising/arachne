The chapter explores the concept of Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) as a means to understand and navigate the complex interactions between humans and nature. It highlights the historical shift from viewing nature as something to conquer and exploit towards the need for sustainable development. The lack of sufficient knowledge on human-nature relationships is identified as a major barrier to achieving sustainability. CHANS is proposed as an integrated framework that emphasizes the reciprocal interactions and feedbacks between human and natural components within multiple organizational levels. The chapter presents an overall conceptual framework for studying CHANS, discussing its application to coupled human and wildlife systems. It concludes by emphasizing the need for a unified language to articulate the complexities of human-nature interactions. The concept and framework of CHANS provide a foundation for addressing global sustainability challenges in the Anthropocene epoch.
