The Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021) reports identify significant data gaps related to the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data for Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. VMS data, collected from commercial fishing vessels, are crucial for understanding fishing activities and their impacts on various sectors. However, the reports highlight several issues and gaps, including regional variability in data availability, the need for more frequent updates of derived products, the absence of recreational fishing data, and limited access to economic data to rank the economic importance of fishing areas. The reports also emphasize the need for improved data processing, consistency in declaring gear types and codes, and enhanced access to economic data. Addressing these data gaps is vital for effective planning and decision-making related to offshore aquaculture, fisheries management, climate adaptation, renewable energy siting, species and habitat management, offshore infrastructure permitting, and state ocean planning efforts.
