A "rainy day" in the context of precipitation analysis can vary based on the chosen threshold, such as the WMO or TRMM standards, or local/regional standards. It's important to communicate the chosen threshold to ensure clear understanding and maintain transparency in the methodology. In conducting research, the threshold can be set based on the goal of the analysis, such as studying heavy rainfall events or any amount of precipitation. Checking the data source for provided definitions or standards is recommended for consistency.
