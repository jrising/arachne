In a previous conversation, James asked about using the `plan()` function in the future package in R for multithreading. Arachne recommended setting the plan at the top of the script and not changing it. If James wants to use multisession when possible, he can set the plan to `plan(multisession)` at the top of the script. This will schedule the futures to run in separate R sessions in the background. Arachne advised against switching back to `plan(sequential)` right after, as it could confuse the interpreter. Regarding killing blocking processes, Arachne mentioned that the future package does not currently support killing or stopping futures once they've started.
