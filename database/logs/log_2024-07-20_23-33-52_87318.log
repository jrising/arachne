James sought assistance on overlaying polygons with different fill styles in a Shiny plot_ly graph. The desired outcome was to have one solid-colored polygon and others with just outlines. With Arachne's guidance, James adjusted the code to set `fillcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)'` for the outlined polygons, used `showlegend=FALSE` to exclude them from the legend, and specified `name='Current'` for the solid polygon to display the legend correctly. The updated code ensured the visual differentiation and clear legend display James was aiming for in visualizing the distribution of Social Cost of Carbon data.
