In a conversation, James sought solutions for obtaining a formatted listing of files within a directory tree using Python. I provided code snippets utilizing the `os` module, particularly `os.walk()`, to traverse directories. The first method displayed directories and their files, while the second method focused specifically on listing files with their relative paths. I also mentioned the use of the `rich` library for more visually appealing outputs. In response to James's request for a simple list, I shared a streamlined code example that lists all files with their relative paths, clarifying the functionality of each part of the code.
