James asked for a recipe for enchiladas using tortillas, mild enchilada sauce, black beans or refried beans, cauliflower, and cheddar cheese. Arachne provided a recipe for Cast-iron Cauliflower and Bean Enchiladas. James then asked about the size of the baking dish, and Arachne recommended a standard 9x13-inch dish. James also asked about lining or greasing the baking dish, and Arachne explained that it's not necessary but can be done for easier cleanup or to prevent sticking.
