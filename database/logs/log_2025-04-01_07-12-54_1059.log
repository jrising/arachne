The conversation involved an examination of the framework for principle-based risk assessment concerning ecosystems, focusing on two Illustrative Cases: the Colorado River Basin and the Amazon Rainforest. The aim was to highlight how the framework could facilitate the assessment of nature-related financial risks, emphasizing the importance of integrating findings from various sources to understand these risks comprehensively. The discussion noted that these cases serve not as prescriptive examples but as insights into evaluating ecosystems' economic value and their connection to climate change. Additionally, it acknowledged the challenges associated with data availability for other ecosystems and encouraged leveraging local expertise while emphasizing that the information provided is a starting point, not exhaustive, for future assessments. Recommendations were referenced for developing scenarios related to nature-related risks.
