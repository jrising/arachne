James inquired about the location of the "new.h" header file on macOS after installing Xcode tools. I clarified that "new.h" is part of the C++ standard library and not found as a standalone file. I provided multiple methods to locate it: using the `locate` command (after updating the locate database), the `find` command from the root directory, and checking Xcode's SDK path with `xcrun`. I emphasized that if the compiler cannot find "new.h," it might be due to the development environment not including standard library headers, which should normally be managed by Xcode.
