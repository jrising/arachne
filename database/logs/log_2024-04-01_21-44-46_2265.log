James provided detailed feedback on the lack of integration and clarity in an economic assessment for New York, suggesting improvements for better communication and understanding. In response, Arachne highlighted the need for enhanced integration and cross-referencing with other sectors, clearer and more accessible figures and tables, comprehensive explanation of sectoral definitions and integration, discussion of missing risks and uncertainties, and suggestions for enhanced comparisons to improve the energy supply and demand section. The aim was to enhance the overall clarity, coherence, and communicative effectiveness of the assessment report for better decision-making and understanding of the impacts of climate change on New York's energy system.
