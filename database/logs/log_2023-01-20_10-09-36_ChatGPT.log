In a conversation about David Eddings's Belgariad series, the user asked about the first person to give birth, which the assistant identified as Polgara, the daughter of Belgarath and sister of Belgarion. The user then inquired about the strong baby born to a warrior, and the assistant named Garion, the child of Polgara and Belgarion, who is born in the first book, "Pawn of Prophecy". The assistant also noted that Garion is the heir to the Rivan throne and plays a significant role throughout the series.
