In an email dated April 3, 2025, James Rising invited Theresa Lober to join an advisory panel for a project on climate change risks and adaptation, which he is leading in collaboration with HMT and the London School of Economics. He shared plans for initial meetings to establish projection scenarios. Theresa expressed enthusiasm about the project and indicated her need for authorization from the Bank of England to participate. She mentioned potential travel funding issues due to her secondment to the Met Office in Exeter. James planned to send a document detailing the project and meeting schedule, inquiring about the expected duration for the authorization process. He also noted that the first two meetings would be held virtually, given his current location in the US.
