James sought a term to describe minor deviations from a smooth curve in a plot, considering the term "jumps" used by a co-author. The assistant suggested alternative terms like "blips", "fluctuations", "noise", or "ripples" to convey these minor irregularities. James was encouraged to choose a term that accurately reflects the nature of the deviations in his data.
