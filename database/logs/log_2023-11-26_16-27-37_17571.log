James asked about the distribution of times between events if the probability of the event happening in each time period is known. Arachne explained that the time between events follows a geometric distribution in this case. She provided the formula for the probability of the k'th trial (first success) occurring on the n'th check in a geometric distribution. When James inquired about the expected duration between events, Arachne informed him that it is equal to the reciprocal of the probability of the event happening in each time period. She emphasized that the expected duration is an average value and does not guarantee a specific outcome in any given sequence of events.
