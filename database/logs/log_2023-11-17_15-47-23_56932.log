The specified integrated assessment model is described, detailing the simulation settings, model variables, model stocks, model flows, and model converters. The model includes equations for carbon intensity of energy, carbon price, CO2 emissions, damage coefficient, damages, effective income, energy demand, energy intensity of GDP, global warming, per person mitigation cost, total mitigation cost, cumulative CO2 emissions, global income per capita, and population. The model also includes flow rates for CO2 emissions, income growth, and population growth. The model converters include average mitigation cost, MAC (carbon intensity of energy), and SSP CO2 emissions.
