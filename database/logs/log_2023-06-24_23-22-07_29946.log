James was having trouble with his Flask application when running it using a Passenger router. Specifically, he encountered an "Incomplete response received from application" error when sending a POST request to a route that streams data back to the browser. To address this issue, I suggested configuring Passenger to disable WebSocket support, which would enable streaming. I provided instructions for making this configuration in three scenarios: standalone mode, Nginx, and Apache. After making the necessary changes and restarting the Passenger server, James should be able to stream data from his Flask application to the browser without any issues.
