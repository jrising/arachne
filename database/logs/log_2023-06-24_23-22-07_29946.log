James is experiencing an issue with his Flask application when using the Passenger router, specifically with streaming data back to the browser. The problem occurs after sending a POST request to a specific route. The assistant suggests configuring Passenger to use the `--disable-websockets` option, providing instructions for standalone mode, Nginx, and Apache installations. Restarting the Passenger server should resolve the issue.
