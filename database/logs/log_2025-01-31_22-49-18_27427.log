James asked how to create a regular expression in Python to extract both the language and enclosed code from a text block, allowing for multiple programming languages specified in a `langsallowed` list. I provided a solution that constructs a regex pattern dynamically from the list and explained how to use `re.findall` to retrieve matches as tuples. In a follow-up, James sought guidance on extracting the language and code from these matches, leading me to explain how to iterate over the matched results and print them neatly.
