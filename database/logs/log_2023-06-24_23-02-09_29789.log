In this conversation, James asked how to reference an image in the static folder of a Flask application from an HTML page. I provided a solution using the `url_for()` function in Flask. I shared an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use `url_for()` to generate the correct URL for the image. The first argument of `url_for()` is 'static', which refers to the endpoint that serves static files in the Flask app. The second argument, `filename='example.png'`, specifies the file (image) to be referenced. I emphasized that this method will generate the correct URL for the image, regardless of the folder structure.
