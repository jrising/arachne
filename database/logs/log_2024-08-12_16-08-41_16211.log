James asked how to replace "enerfrac" with "soc" in `.jl` files on a Mac. I provided a step-by-step guide using the `sed` command in Terminal. This included opening Terminal, navigating to the directory, running the `sed` command to replace the string, and checking the files after the replacements. Additionally, I explained the components of the `sed` command used for the substitution.
