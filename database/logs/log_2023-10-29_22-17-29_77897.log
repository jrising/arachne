In a previous conversation, James asked how far a ship from the 1850s could see land. Arachne explained that the distance a ship can see land depends on the height of the observer's eyes above the water line due to the curvature of the Earth. Assuming a height of 30 meters (about 100 feet) for the crow's nest, Arachne used the formula âˆš(h) to estimate that an observer in a 100-foot high crow's nest could potentially see land about 10 nautical miles away in clear weather conditions. Arachne also mentioned that the visibility can be impacted by factors like weather conditions and the height of the coastal features.
