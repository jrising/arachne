James Rising addressed a request regarding supervising a prospective PhD student, Md. Emran Hosen, who expressed interest in the Environmental Economics program at the University of Delaware. James outlined various academic programs, including the transition of the Masters in Marine Policy to a new Environmental Science & Management program. He informed the applicant about limited funding and encouraged applying by December 1 for full consideration. James affirmed Emran's interest in working together and encouraged him to mention this in his Statement of Purpose. A program identification form was provided to assist students in selecting the most suitable program based on their backgrounds. Emran followed up to confirm his ongoing interest for Fall 2025.
