"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" is a philosophical novel by Robert M. Pirsig that blends storytelling and philosophy. The book is based on real experiences, but it should be understood as a work of fiction and philosophical inquiry rather than a strictly factual account. Pirsig received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the early 1960s, which he described as traumatic in the book. The Greek Phaedrus is a concept and pseudonym in the book, representing Pirsig's former self, his intellectual pursuits, and struggles with mental illness. Pirsig's metaphysics of quality is a philosophical framework he developed, suggesting that quality is the fundamental unit of reality, and there are dynamic and static quality. He also explores the relationship between science and values, arguing for a more inclusive approach that incorporates subjective experience and values for a more complete understanding of reality. The metaphysics of quality has sparked discussion and debate among philosophers and readers.
