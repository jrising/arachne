The report discusses the estimated losses that countries have already experienced due to climate change. The global population-weighted GDP loss in 2022 is 6.4%, but as a percentage of global GDP, it is 0.6%. This discrepancy is due to the benefits that wealthier countries have gained from climate change. The Global South, particularly tropical regions, has suffered significant losses, with African nations experiencing an average 10% GDP loss in 2022. Southern Africa has been hit the hardest, with a 17% GDP loss. In contrast, Europe and northern Asia have seen GDP increases of 5% and 7% respectively. The report also highlights the stark contrast between developed and developing nations, with negligible losses recorded for developed countries and an average 11% GDP loss for low-income countries. The United States has seen a 2% GDP gain, while China has experienced no change. The cost to high-income countries has been minimal, with a net gain of $287 billion, while the rest of the world has incurred a net GDP loss of $1217 billion. These findings emphasize the existing global inequality exacerbated by climate change and provide insights into potential future trajectories if current trends continue.
