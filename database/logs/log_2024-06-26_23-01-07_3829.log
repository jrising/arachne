James designed a new language using letters N, I, and O, with roots defining concepts and nine derived letters representing new meanings. He requested translations, resulting in "Fish Networks" being translated to **ANI-IN-RMNR**, with detailed breakdowns for "fish" as **MIN** and "networks" as **UNN** according to the language's rules.
