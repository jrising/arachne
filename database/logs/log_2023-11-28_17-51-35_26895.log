In a conversation with James, he sought guidance on the restrictions imposed by his GPL v3.0 license when a group with an MIT License incorporates components from his package. The assistant explained that the GPL v3.0 is a copyleft license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute code under the same license terms. If the group incorporates James' GPL v3.0 licensed code, they must preserve the GPL license, ensuring that derivative works are released under the same terms. The entire project essentially becomes GPL v3.0 licensed due to the 'viral' nature of the GPL. The assistant also highlighted that source code and modifications must be made available, changes must be disclosed, and no additional restrictions can be added to the GPL license. However, the assistant emphasized the importance of seeking legal advice for specific situations.
