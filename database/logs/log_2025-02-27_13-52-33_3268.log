In a previous conversation, Dr. James Rising requested assistance in completing a form for a research software engineer position for the "Coastal Barometer" project, aimed at assessing the health of Delawareâ€™s coastal economy. Key prompts included crafting a project abstract (under 100 words), outlining 3-5 deliverables with timelines, and identifying necessary computational skills. The response provided an abstract describing the project's goal of developing a dashboard for economic health, listed deliverables such as stakeholder engagement and AI integration over a 24-month timeline, and highlighted required skills, including proficiency in R, web development, and AI tools.
