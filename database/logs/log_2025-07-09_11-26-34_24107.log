James inquired about generating random draws from a distribution defined by its 0.167, 0.5, and 0.833 quantiles using R, aiming for minimal assumptions. I suggested using interpolation via the `splinefun` function to create an inverse CDF and then transforming uniform samples to obtain random draws. When James pointed out that this method only produced values within the quantile range, I provided a revised approach incorporating extrapolation to extend the distribution beyond these quantiles. I outlined a function that allows for linear extrapolation and detailed how to implement it in R, thereby enabling random samples that include values outside the specified quantile bounds.
