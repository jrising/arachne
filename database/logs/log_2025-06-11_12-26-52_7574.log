In a discussion about using the `ranger` package in R for estimating random forests, the user described their model call: `ranger(dimpact ~ ., data=values, num.trees=500, max.depth=12, verbose=TRUE)`. They sought guidance on writing a comprehensive description of their model setup for a paper, especially in response to reviewer inquiries regarding data splitting, performance evaluation, and training methods. I recommended structuring their write-up to include model configuration, data partitioning (clarifying that no explicit splitting was done), performance evaluation through out-of-bag (OOB) error and RMSE, and insights from model outputs. The user requested a LaTeX section with placeholders for specific metrics and sought clarification on data handling methods, resulting in a revised section emphasizing the use of OOB samples for performance assessment.
