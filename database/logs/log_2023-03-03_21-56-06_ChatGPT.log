Extinction Rebellion (XR) was created in May 2018 by a group of activists including Roger Hallam, Gail Bradbrook, and Simon Bramwell, who were associated with the campaign group "Rising Up!". XR is a decentralized and global movement that aims to draw attention to the climate and ecological crisis. It is not affiliated with any political party or organization and relies on donations from supporters for funding.
