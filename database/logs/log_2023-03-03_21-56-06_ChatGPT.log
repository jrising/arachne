Extinction Rebellion (XR) was created in 2018 by activists in the UK, including Roger Hallam, Gail Bradbrook, and others associated with the campaign group "Rising Up!". XR is a decentralized movement that has become a global network of autonomous groups and individuals working to address the climate and ecological crisis. It is not affiliated with any political party or organization and is mostly funded by donations from supporters.
