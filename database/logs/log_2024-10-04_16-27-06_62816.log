James asked for help with an Apps Script to send emails based on Google Form responses linked to a spreadsheet. He encountered a `TypeError` indicating `getActive()` returned null, preventing access to the associated spreadsheet. I advised that the error typically occurs when running the script outside of a spreadsheet context. 

I suggested linking the form to a Google Sheet, using the `openById` method to access the spreadsheet directly, and modifying the function to handle the form submission event. Also, I guided him to set up a trigger for the function to run upon form submission. This solution ensures that the script processes the data correctly and sends emails based on specific responses while marking them as processed.
