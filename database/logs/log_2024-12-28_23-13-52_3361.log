James explored the historical feasibility of Barbary Corsairs attacking an English ship near the Canary Islands, with a Spanish ship coming to the rescue. I confirmed that such scenarios were plausible due to the Corsairs’ activities in that region and the complex but occasionally cooperative relationship between Spain and England against mutual enemies. James sought phrases the Corsairs might have used, and I suggested using Arabic and Turkish terms like "الأسبان!" (Al-Asbān!) or "İspanyollar!" to communicate the sighting of Spaniards, emphasizing urgency in their call.
