The historical event that precipitated Japan's decision to "give up the gun" was the implementation of the Sakoku policy during the Tokugawa Shogunate in the Edo Period. This policy aimed to consolidate power and maintain social stability by minimizing external influences, particularly from European countries. The threat of European influence through the introduction of Christianity and firearms influenced this decision. Japan had experienced intense civil war during the Sengoku Period, where firearms played a significant role. To suppress the spread of Christianity and limit foreign powers, the Tokugawa Shogunate implemented isolationist policies, severely restricting international trade and contact. As a result, firearms production and use decreased, leading to a peaceful society focused on traditional martial arts. The Sakoku policy lasted for over two centuries until the Meiji Restoration in 1868 when Japan reintroduced firearms and modernized.
