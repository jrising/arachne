The historical event that led to Japan's decision to "give up the gun" was the implementation of the Sakoku policy during the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603-1868). Japan restricted the use and production of firearms to consolidate power, limit the influence of Christianity and foreign powers, and maintain social stability. This policy lasted for over two centuries, during which Japan became a peaceful society focused on traditional martial arts. However, Japan eventually abandoned the Sakoku policy during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, leading to modernization and the reintroduction of firearms.
