The discussion revolved around how to make the best decision when faced with multiple models that give different probability distributions over states of the world. Various approaches were suggested, including model averaging, maximin decision rule, minimax regret, Bayesian decision theory, ensemble methods, and robust decision making. Each method has its own assumptions and trade-offs, and the best approach depends on factors such as the level of trust in each model, the degree of disagreement between models, and the tolerance for uncertainty and risk.
