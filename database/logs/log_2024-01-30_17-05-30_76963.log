According to reports by Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021), "Human and Cultural Use Areas" represent data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay spatial planning. These areas include regions designated for recreational activities and places of cultural and historical significance, particularly for indigenous communities. The reports highlight the need for improved data on these areas to address issues such as offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience, renewable energy facility siting, species and habitat management, maritime safety, and permitting for offshore infrastructure. Currently, comprehensive data on these uses, including hot spots and recreation patterns, are lacking. The reports also emphasize the need for updated and publicly available information on Tribal Protected Areas, National Historic Preservation Act data, and documentation in the metadata. Addressing these data gaps would support more effective decision-making and management of these areas in Delaware's planning process. Local sources and engagement should be considered to contextualize the data gaps specifically for Delaware.
