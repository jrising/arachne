In a previous conversation, James asked how to parse date strings in R. Arachne suggested using the `lubridate` package, specifically the `parse_date_time()` function, which can handle a wide range of date formats. Arachne provided an example code snippet using the `parse_date_time()` function and explained how to define the possible formats for the date strings using format specifiers like "B" for month full name and "Y" for the 4-digit year. Arachne also mentioned that the `parse_date_time()` function returns a POSIXct object, which is a date-time object in R.
