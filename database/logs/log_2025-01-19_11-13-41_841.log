James requested assistance in suggesting reviewers for a food security and health proposal in the U.S., referencing a similar proposal focused on West Africa. I offered to help but asked for more context, including the specific references, the proposal's approach (policy-oriented, technical, sociological, etc.), the target funding body, and any other specific parameters necessary for accurate reviewer recommendations.
