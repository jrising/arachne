In a recent email exchange, Abdullah Al Maruf expressed interest in James Rising's research lab for fall 2025 graduate studies. Abdullah, a Zoology graduate from Jagannath University, highlighted his background in sustainable aquaculture and conservation. James directed him to a form to align his interests with the appropriate program. After Abdullah mistakenly marked himself as a U.S. citizen for a graduate award, he clarified his status and sought to amend the submission. James informed him of the lack of available funding for the Ph.D. program and encouraged exploring external opportunities. Abdullah then inquired about the possibility of applying for a Master's program, and James clarified that it also requires self-funding, offering to chat further about the application process.
