In this conversation, James sought guidance on preparing for interviews with representatives from finance ministries regarding his report on climate change adaptation investment. He asked whether to include an "Interview Preparation" sheet alongside his introductory letter. I recommended providing such a sheet to stimulate productive discussions, and outlined its components: purpose, key topics (like macroeconomic impacts and fiscal implications), and sample questions. James then requested a draft of this preparation sheet. I provided a structured draft, detailing the purpose, key topics for discussion, and sample questions aimed at gathering insightful responses from interviewees, ensuring relevance for economic decision-makers.
