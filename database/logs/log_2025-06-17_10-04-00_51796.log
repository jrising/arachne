James inquired about executing a command every 2 minutes using JavaScript or jQuery. I explained that this can be achieved through the `setInterval()` function, providing a code example where a specified function executes every 120 seconds. I also mentioned how to stop this function using `clearInterval()`. Subsequently, James asked how to "reset" the timer when an action occurs. I outlined a solution where the existing interval is cleared and a new one is set every time an action is performed. I provided an example code demonstrating the setup of interval management and the integration of an action that triggers the timer reset.
