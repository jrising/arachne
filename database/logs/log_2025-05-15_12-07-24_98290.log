James asked how to use `dplyr` to group a dataframe and set a column to a specific value if there was only one entry in that group. I responded with a solution using `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `if_else()`. I provided a code example that demonstrates how to group data by a `group` column and conditionally set a `new_value` column to 100 if the group size is 1, or retain the original `value` otherwise. The solution effectively applies the desired condition to each group, with a clear structure for modification based on specific use cases.
