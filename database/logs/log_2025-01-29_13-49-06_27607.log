Arqam Tariq inquired about transferring from the PhD Public Policy program to the PhD Environmental Economics (EE) program, seeking clarity on funding and course credit. The Graduate College indicated that funding typically does not transfer when changing programs and that specific arrangements would need to be made with the Program Director, Professor Moffat. James Rising emphasized the necessity of securing funding prior to transfer and noted the limited availability of funding for the EE program this year. Despite Arqam's exploration of potential funding options, including a temporary transfer of support from the Biden School, Rising advised that a transfer to the EE program is not currently feasible. Ultimately, Arqam received confirmation that transferring funding for an extended period might not be possible, leading to the realization that the transfer would not work out.
