The time it takes to build a new nuclear power plant, including siting and governance, can vary depending on factors such as regulatory requirements, local opposition, and construction challenges. The siting process involves identifying potential locations, evaluating impacts, and obtaining permits, which can take several years. Once the siting process is complete, the construction of the nuclear power plant can take several years as well. Overall, the process can range from 5 to 10 years or more and is subject to delays and cost overruns.
