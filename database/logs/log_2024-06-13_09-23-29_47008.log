James requested a bash script to manage stale R processes, which the AI promptly provided. The script initializes a process directory, starts four R processes, and monitors them hourly. If a process stalls for more than three hours, it is terminated and replaced. Key aspects include process initialization, hourly monitoring, stall detection, and process status checking. The script ensures continuous monitoring and management of R processes to prevent stalls exceeding three hours.
