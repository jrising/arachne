James inquired about the difference between "annualized" and "amortized." I explained that "annualized" refers to converting a rate into an annual rate for easier comparison, while "amortized" involves spreading the cost of an expense or payment over time, commonly used in loans. "Annualized" is about standardizing rates to a yearly basis, whereas "amortized" distributes costs across the payment duration.
