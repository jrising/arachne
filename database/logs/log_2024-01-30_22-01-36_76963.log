In support of his report on data gaps for Delaware's ocean and bay planning process, James references a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018) that identifies key issues and data requirements for permitting and siting offshore infrastructure. The report highlights the challenges in managing the siting and permitting of offshore energy transmission and telecommunications cables, pipelines, and platforms, as well as the permitting of structures, permit reviews, and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs). James is specifically interested in data gaps relevant to Delaware's planning process. The critical data gaps identified include understanding the jurisdictions and regulated areas, abundance and distribution of marine species, human and cultural use areas, bathymetry, species and habitat locations (including benthic habitats), and the locations of existing oil and gas pipelines, cables, and transmission lines. The available data may not be comprehensive or sufficiently detailed for Delaware's specific context, indicating the need for further research and data collection.
