In the previous conversation, James asked how to split a column with multiple lines in Excel into separate columns using formulas. The assistant provided formulas for extracting lines using `FILTERXML()` and a combination of functions like `SUBSTITUTE()`, `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, and `LEN()`. James requested the formulas for lines 3 and 4, and the assistant provided the correct formulas. However, there was a misunderstanding, and the assistant provided the incorrect formulas again. James then explicitly asked for formulas for lines 1 to 4, and the assistant provided the correct formulas for each line. The assistant clarified that these formulas assume consistent line breaks and suggested using a scripting language like VBA for handling inconsistent line breaks or a larger number of lines.
