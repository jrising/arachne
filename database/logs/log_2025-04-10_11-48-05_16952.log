In a conversation, James inquired about inserting a variable, "GlobalPopulation," as non-italicized text in the Google Docs equation editor, akin to `\text{GlobalPopulation}` in LaTeX. I explained that Google Docs has limited formatting options in its equation editor, which defaults to italicizing single-letter variables. I suggested a workaround: typing "GlobalPopulation" as regular text outside the equation editor and formatting it to match the equation style. This solution, while not ideal, would maintain a consistent visual appearance in the document. I noted that future updates to Google Docs might improve this feature.
