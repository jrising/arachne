James inquired about the distinctiveness and loyalty of Robert Peck's church, excommunicated for Puritan beliefs. I highlighted key aspects that may have driven loyalty among congregants, including simplicity in worship, emphasis on scripture, strong community bonds, opposition to established practices, charismatic leadership, and the promise of religious freedom in America. These factors likely contributed to the unique appeal of Peck's church, inspiring members to undertake the journey to America for religious freedom and a shared spiritual experience.
