In a conversation about climate science, James inquired about the difference between radiative forcing and Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI). I explained that radiative forcing measures changes in energy fluxes in the atmosphere due to external factors like greenhouse gases, while EEI quantifies the net energy retained by the Earth system. Following this, James asked what would occur if CO2 concentrations were held constant over the next 100 years. I clarified that radiative forcing would remain stable, whereas EEI might initially stay positive before trending towards zero as the climate system achieves a new equilibrium. Maintaining constant CO2 levels could stabilize both temperature and climate dynamics, although past emissions would still exert an influence.
