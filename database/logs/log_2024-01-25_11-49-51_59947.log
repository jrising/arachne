This conversation revolved around James requesting summaries for his new publication in various formats for social media. I provided a tweet summarizing the study, an HTML block for the OMG lab website, and an article for his professional blog. The tweet highlighted the hidden impact of extreme weather on coffee production and the new approach that reveals the direct effects of temperature on yields and a die-off effect. The HTML block included the publication details and links to the article and data. The blog post discussed the risks of climate change on perennial crops, specifically Brazilian coffee, and emphasized the misreported yields and management decisions that impact our understanding of these risks. It showcased the study's findings on the impact of extreme temperatures and highlighted the unified statistical approach used to analyze the data. It also provided links to the full paper and data.
