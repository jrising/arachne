James responds to Xiaodi Zhang's email expressing interest in becoming a visiting scholar in the field of environmental economics at James' institution. While acknowledging Xiaodi's impressive research and extensive experience in carbon footprints, carbon emission trading, and carbon tax, James regrets to inform Xiaodi that their research interests do not align sufficiently. James suggests that Xiaodi would benefit more from working with a research institution or academic whose primary focus is more closely aligned with their research. James invites Xiaodi to book a Zoom call to discuss environmental economics or explore other potential avenues at their institution.
