In 2024, the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) achieved significant milestones across several initiatives. Key highlights include the expansion of their Corporate Engagement Opportunities program and the celebration of the Green Lease Leaders program's 10th anniversary. IMT co-founded the Building Performance Partnership, securing funding for community-based training assessments. Their partnership with the White House led to the growth of the National Building Performance Standards Coalition, potentially reducing carbon emissions significantly. IMT also commenced work on federal grants, including a $5.5 million award for building performance standards, while promoting energy transparency through the Model Utility Data Access Law. Collaborating on initiatives like the Green Buildings Career Map and piloting Community Accountability Boards, IMT focused on equity in the energy transition. They supported federal funding applications totaling $1 billion and made substantial grants to local organizations, enhancing partnerships to better community engagement and climate action initiatives.
