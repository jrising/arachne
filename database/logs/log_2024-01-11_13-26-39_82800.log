Ms. Aghanwa Onyinyechi Chinenye, in her email, expressed her interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Marine Studies at the University of Delaware. She highlighted her research focus on the impact of flooding on coastal areas and her desire to work under your supervision. Given her interests and background in maritime management, she seems well-suited for the Ph.D. program in Marine Policy, which aligns with your research on climate change risks and interdisciplinary modeling. However, it should be noted that funding for the Ph.D. program is limited. The suggested response emphasizes her strong grasp of marine policy issues and encourages her to apply by the end of the year to be considered for any available funds.
