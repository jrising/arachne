In this conversation, James sought to plan a class activity focused on developing an adaptation strategy over multiple years while illustrating the concept of backward induction. Arachne proposed a structured setup comprising an introduction to adaptation strategies, grouping students, and having them research potential measures. The core of the activity involved a backward induction exercise where students started from the end goal and worked backwards to define yearly milestones. The plan included group presentations and reflections to deepen understanding. Arachne also suggested materials and assessment criteria to evaluate student learning, ensuring an engaging and educational experience.
