The data gaps in commercial fishing effort, particularly related to Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Vessel Trip Report (VTR) data, pose challenges for maritime spatial planning decisions in Delaware's ocean and bay areas. VMS data, collected from commercial fishing vessels, is essential for understanding fishing activities, but issues with regional data availability, the need for derived products, and the lack of recreational and economic data hinder its effectiveness. VTR data, documenting catches landed by licensed fishermen, is important for various activities, but challenges include outdated data, exclusion of recreational fishing data, and the need for consultation to define appropriate planning products. Addressing these gaps requires improved data processing and availability, consistency in declaring codes and gear types, and the regular updating of atlases and products. Enhancing these data sources would provide stakeholders and decision-makers with a more comprehensive understanding of fishing activities in Delaware's ocean and bay, supporting improved planning and decision-making processes.
