The "Solutions Showcases" are online presentations by energy providers aimed at engaging energy customers and addressing market needs through innovative strategies. They offer a platform for providers to demonstrate their solutions without competitor presence. Sessions occur bi-monthly on Thursdays, with sponsorship opportunities for Gold, Leadership Circle, and Silver members, including complimentary sessions and promotional support.

The material on the Building Performance Partnership between IMT and Building Energy Exchange (BE-Ex) can enhance a Solutions Showcase by focusing on improving building energy use through local Hubs tailored to meet community needs. It highlights the partnership's objectives of driving sustainable action, sharing resources, and providing regional customization, alongside success stories that illustrate measurable impacts.
