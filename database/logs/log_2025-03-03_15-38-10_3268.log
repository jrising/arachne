In a previous conversation, James sought to find out which columns in a sparse matrix of `dgCMatrix` format had non-zero values in a specific row without converting it into a dense vector. I initially suggested accessing the values using a `j` slot, which was incorrect. After James pointed out the absence of a `j` slot, I provided a corrected method using the `p` and `i` slots to identify non-zero columns efficiently. This involved accessing the appropriate start and end indices for the specified row and outputting the relevant column indices, ensuring the results are in a 1-based format suitable for R.
