James inquired about the types of Amphipoda found in the Alps. I provided information about various Amphipoda, emphasizing species adapted to cold habitats, particularly in freshwater ecosystems. I mentioned **Niphargus species**, common in subterranean waters; **Gammarus species**, prevalent in surface waters and important as detritivores; **Crangonyctidae**, which includes species inhabiting groundwaters and caves; and **Pseudoniphargus species**, found in specific alpine aquatic environments. I suggested consulting local biodiversity records or entomological surveys for more precise species identification.
