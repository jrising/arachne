James received feedback from a reviewer on his paper regarding the random forest (RF) model methodology. The reviewer found the method's setup unclear, particularly the input and output specifications for the prediction task. In response, Arachne suggested representing the model mathematically with a formula: \( Y_{\text{pred}} = f_{\text{RF}}(\mathbf{X}) \), where \( \mathbf{X} \) is a vector of quality attributes, and \( Y_{\text{pred}} \) is the predicted outcome. Arachne emphasized the importance of enumerating specific attributes in accompanying text or tables and stressed referencing Supplementary Materials 1.5 for detailed descriptions of variables. This guidance aimed to enhance clarity and comprehension for the reviewer.
