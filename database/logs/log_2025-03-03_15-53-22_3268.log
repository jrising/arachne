In the conversation from **2025-03-03 15:38:10**, James asked whether there is an efficient way to identify non-zero columns of a specific row in a `dgCMatrix`. I provided a solution in R, outlining a function called `find_nonzero_columns`. The function utilizes the matrix's `p` and `i` slots to efficiently retrieve non-zero column indices without converting the sparse matrix into a dense format. I emphasized the importance of adjusting for R's 1-indexing because the `i` slot uses zero-indexing. An example use case was included to illustrate how to apply the function.
