James asked how to repeatedly call an Ajax command in jQuery with a 1-second delay until the server's response indicates to stop. Arachne provided a code snippet using `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`, along with an explanation. James then asked about the type of the `response` object and how to convert it to a string. Arachne clarified the `response` object and suggested using `JSON.stringify()` to get the string representation of the response.
