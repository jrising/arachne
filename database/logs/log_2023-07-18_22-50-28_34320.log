In the initial conversation, James asked how to repeatedly call an Ajax command every second until the server responds with a message to stop. The assistant provided a solution using `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` functions in jQuery. The assistant gave a code example and explained how to modify it for individual needs. In a follow-up question, James asked how to get the string representation of the server response. The assistant suggested using the `JSON.stringify()` method to convert the response object into a JSON string. The assistant provided an updated code example and advised on how to use the `responseString` variable for further operations. The conversation provided practical guidance on making repeated Ajax calls and extracting the response data.
