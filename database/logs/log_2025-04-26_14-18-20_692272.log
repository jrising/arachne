James requested "sexy icebreaker questions" to facilitate flirty conversations. I provided a variety of playful questions, initially offering seven options, including inquiries about ideal dates and romantic places. When he asked for more, I expanded the list with additional engaging questions, such as ideas for a romantic getaway and preferences on public displays of affection. The discussion focused on keeping the tone lighthearted and respectful, encouraging adaptation based on the conversational context.
