James requested edits and feedback on his external dossier for tenure review. He provided a description of his writing style and highlighted his achievements, including publications, citations, grant funding, mentoring, and course development. In response, I suggested edits to enhance clarity and impact. I revised the highlights section to provide a clearer breakdown of his publications, citations, funding, mentoring, and course development. I also offered revised summaries of selected papers, highlighting James' contributions, such as authorship, roles in discussions, writing, and data analysis. This would strengthen his case for tenure review by showcasing his expertise, achievements, and scholarly contributions.
