James inquired about "programmatic decision making" within grant terminology. I explained that it encompasses the processes through which funding organizations select projects to support, aligning them with strategic goals and desired impacts. Key considerations include return on investment, feasibility, and community impact. The process involves reviewing grant applications, using score-based evaluations, and discussions in decision-making committees. Additionally, programmatic decision making also entails evaluating ongoing programs by monitoring progress and outcomes to determine continued funding or adjustments needed for better alignment with goals.
