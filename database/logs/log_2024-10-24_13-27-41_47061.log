James inquired about the difference between "constant" 2022 dollars and "real" 2022 dollars. I clarified that there is no significant difference between these terms; both refer to dollar values adjusted for inflation, ensuring that comparisons over time account for changes in purchasing power. Thus, "constant" and "real" dollars are used interchangeably in economic contexts for consistent analysis.
