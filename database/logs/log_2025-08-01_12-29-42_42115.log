James Rising inquired about the best research institutions in Europe or the UK for interdisciplinary study on climate change, as he plans to apply for an ERC grant. I provided a list of notable institutions, including the University of Oxford, Imperial College London, University of Cambridge, ETH Zurich, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Stockholm Resilience Centre, Wageningen University & Research, and Basque Centre for Climate Change. Each institution is recognized for integrating diverse disciplines to address climate change challenges, emphasizing collaboration across natural and social sciences. I advised James to consider his specific research interests and local research cultures when choosing the best fit for his interdisciplinary work.
