James sought guidance on reorganizing his Shiny app to have a main front page and subsequent sub-pages with different graphs. I provided detailed instructions using `shinydashboard` and `navbarPage` layouts, offering code examples and explanations for both options. James was given the flexibility to choose the layout that best suits his design preferences and functional requirements.
