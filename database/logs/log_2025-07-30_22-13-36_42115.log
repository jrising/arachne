The discussion centered around a study that integrates the economic and health impacts of climate change and air pollution, which are usually assessed separately. The study enhanced the PAGE-ICE integrated assessment model to cover 183 countries, incorporating critical improvements like the FaIR climate model, risk indices for vulnerability, and updating cost estimates. It emphasizes the sector-specific impacts on agriculture, labor productivity, and health, including methane influences. Additionally, the GAINS model was utilized to analyze PM2.5 concentrations and their cross-border effects, linking these to productivity and health outcomes. The findings indicate substantial economic and health losses from climate change and pollution interactions. Though increased vulnerability elevates risks, the primary concern is the reduced size of economies, which affects future emissions and climate impacts.
