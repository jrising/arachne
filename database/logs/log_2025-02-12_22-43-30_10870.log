James sought to understand how R calculates the information in an ANOVA using his model \( mod = lm(value ~ scenario + factor(run_id), data=df2) \). He provided the ANOVA table, showing the degrees of freedom, sum of squares, mean square, F value, and p-values for `scenario`, `factor(run_id)`, and residuals. I explained how to calculate the "sum sq" values by hand, detailing the steps for Total Sum of Squares (TSS), Sum of Squares for `scenario`, and `factor(run_id)`, as well as the Residual Sum of Squares (SSR). I emphasized that while the calculations can be done manually for learning purposes, R simplifies the process and provides valuable insights into the ANOVA results.
