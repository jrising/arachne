According to reports by Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021), there are several data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. The Vessel Traffic-Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data, collected by the USCG and shared with the public through the Marine Cadastre, offers valuable information, but limitations exist. Key areas that could benefit from data enhancements include offshore aquaculture siting, fisheries management, community resilience, offshore renewable energy siting, species and habitat management, oil and gas extraction, maritime and navigation safety, permitting for offshore infrastructure, and subsistence use. The AIS data needs improvements in vessel type designation and characteristics, real-time or up-to-date availability, and possible inclusion of satellite AIS data. Implementing these enhancements could improve marine and coastal management efforts in Delaware, particularly in renewable energy siting and conservation planning.
