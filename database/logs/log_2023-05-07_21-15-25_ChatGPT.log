LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regularization technique used in linear regression models to prevent overfitting and enhance model interpretability. It is chosen over direct model selection with cross-validation under several conditions: high dimensionality, multicollinearity, feature selection, regularization, and faster model selection. LASSO efficiently performs variable selection and regularization, addresses multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients, automatically selects features, adds an L1 penalty for preventing overfitting, and is computationally efficient. However, LASSO may not be suitable when the number of predictor variables is greater than the number of observations or when there are highly correlated predictors. In such cases, other regularization techniques like Ridge Regression or Elastic Net may be more appropriate.
