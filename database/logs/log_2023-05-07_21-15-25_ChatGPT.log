The discussion explored the conditions under which one would choose LASSO over direct model selection with cross-validation for a regression model. LASSO is useful in high dimensionality, addressing multicollinearity, performing automatic feature selection, adding regularization to prevent overfitting, and speeding up model selection. However, it may not be suitable in cases where there are more predictors than observations or when there are highly correlated predictors. Other regularization techniques like Ridge Regression or Elastic Net may be more appropriate in such cases.
