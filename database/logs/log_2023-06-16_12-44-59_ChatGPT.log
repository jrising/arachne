James asked how to move shapefile coordinates from a 0-360 system to a -180 to 180 system in QGIS. The assistant provided a step-by-step guide, advising James to back up the original shapefile, open it in QGIS, use the 'Translate' tool in the 'Processing Toolbox,' set the translation formula depending on the condition for subtracting 360, and save the output as a new shapefile. The assistant also mentioned the need to handle situations where polygons cross the 180-degree line and suggested using more advanced GIS techniques or custom scripting for complex cases. The assistant emphasized the importance of replacing `"Longitude"` with the actual field name and noted that the translate tool only shifts coordinates, not handling the splitting of polygons.
