James inquired whether discussions about ozone as a pollutant focus on locally-produced near-surface ozone or if it is the result of global processes. I clarified that the concern centers on **locally-produced near-surface ozone**, formed through reactions involving oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. This ground-level ozone significantly impacts human health and agriculture, distinguishing it from stratospheric ozone, which pertains to global processes and ozone depletion but does not directly affect health or agriculture.
