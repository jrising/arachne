This conversation included various log entries of past discussions, such as writing the units label for "millions of 2021 dollars" on a graph, obtaining y-values for ggplot2's geom_density, IO matrices and sector information in R, and making the best decision with multiple models. Other discussions included implementing a recursive function with Ajax commands, hiding a sidebar on mobile with CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, creating a vertical ribbon and changing labels in ggplot facets, creating faded white backgrounds for labels on a ggplot graph, Dell OptiPlex BIOS startup key and instructions for booting from USB, and alternatives to pie charts for representing parts combining into a whole. James later asked for ways to make the amount of emissions of 1 GtCO2 intuitive, and Arachne provided analogies such as visual and volume comparisons, as well as a contextual comparison to global emissions.
