James sought ideas to educate staff at the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) about engaging with donors and cultivating relationships. I provided a structured list that included understanding donor motivations, effective communication, personal recognition, networking events, active listening, long-term relationship building, conducting donor surveys, and encouraging professional development. Seeking a more friendly tone, I rephrased these suggestions into engaging activities, such as donor persona workshops, storytelling sessions, a gratitude challenge, game nights for practice, casual coffee chats, feedback parties, and a donor engagement book club. These approaches aimed to make learning enjoyable and foster a vibrant culture of donor relationship building at IMT.
