James requested help in planning a 36-month proposal divided into 8 work packages. The proposal focuses on rising food insecurity in West Africa and includes tasks such as stakeholder meetings, scenario development, mapping climate change impacts, and analyzing fisheries management scenarios. The tasks were organized into a table with proposed durations for each task. James then asked for a Gantt chart representation of the tasks, accounting for dependencies and the 36-month project duration. The resulting Gantt chart provided start dates and end dates for each task across the project timeline.
