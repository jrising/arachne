James Rising's research program focuses on interdisciplinary studies addressing climate impacts, land use, fisheries, health, transportation, tipping points, and environmental equity. By employing quantitative techniques from various fields, Rising aims to develop systems perspectives and contribute as a researcher and educator. His research aims to better manage social-environmental systems under global environmental change and develop detailed transition pathways for economic and environmental sustainability. Rising also focuses on bridging gaps between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics to enhance understanding of climate risks. He has collaborated with the Climate Impact Lab, developing groundbreaking approaches to quantify climate risks and adaptation costs. Rising has also developed innovative tools for climate risk analysis, including an online database of economic risks. His research incorporates the study of interactions and feedback loops within complex systems, particularly within the food system, and contributes to integrated assessment modeling for supporting climate policy, including the enhancement of the PAGE model.
