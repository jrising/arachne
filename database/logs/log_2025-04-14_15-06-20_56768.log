James inquired whether he could use guitar chord music to play the piano. I confirmed that it is possible but requires adaptation. I outlined key steps including understanding chord symbols, playing root notes with the left hand, and using the right hand for chord execution. I suggested considering rhythm and style for interpretation since guitar charts lack specific rhythmic notation. Additionally, I recommended practicing basic piano chords to ease the transition. Overall, I emphasized that while it may take time, utilizing guitar charts for piano can be a fun and flexible approach when sheet music is unavailable.
