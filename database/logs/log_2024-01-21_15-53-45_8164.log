In a previous conversation, James asked how to extract an object from an image using Illustrator or GIMP. Arachne explained that both software options are suitable depending on the type of image. For vector-based images, Illustrator is recommended, while GIMP is better for raster images. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions for extracting objects using each program, emphasizing the importance of accuracy in selection. For complex images in GIMP, Arachne suggested using the "Scissors Select Tool" for more precise extraction.
