In a discussion about using `plot_grid` in R with different spacing between panels, James first inquired about achieving variable spacing. I explained that while `plot_grid` from the `cowplot` package doesn't directly support this, he could use blank plots as spacers to adjust spacing. After discovering that `plot_spacer()` wasnâ€™t recognized, I suggested using `ggplot()` to create empty plots instead. James then sought to minimize spacing between two specific plots by removing certain margins, which I confirmed could be done using `theme()`. Finally, he asked for solutions to enhance the readability of overlapping x-axis labels on smaller figures. I recommended rotating labels, modifying text size, and using `scales::breaks_width()` to reduce the number of x-axis labels shown automatically, ensuring adaptability to various data ranges.
