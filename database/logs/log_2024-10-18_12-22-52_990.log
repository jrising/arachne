In a recent conversation, James requested a FY 2025 fundraising plan for IMT following a staff meeting on development and finance. He shared key takeaways emphasizing the partnership between the Development and Finance teams, specifying responsibilities for each staff member. The proposed fundraising plan aimed to increase total income by 20%, engage more corporate donors, and secure new government grants through well-defined strategies led by team members like Johanna Goetzel and Shubhada Kambli. Additionally, James asked for a thank you note to be drafted for sponsors of the "Decarbonizing DC" event on October 16, expressing gratitude for their partnership and proposing a follow-up call to discuss future collaborations.
