This section discusses the theoretical foundations and methods for studying coupled systems. Theoretical foundations draw upon various systems theories and insights from different disciplines such as ecology, economics, and sociology. Existing theories can provide insights into coupled systems, but further development is needed to effectively address them. Methods for studying coupled systems require a portfolio approach and interdisciplinary expertise. The research process involves defining system boundaries, setting research goals and questions, and quantifying components and relationships. Data collection methods include interviews, surveys, remote sensing, and field surveys. Data cleaning, management, analysis, integration, and visualization are crucial steps. The section emphasizes the need for innovative approaches, such as modeling coupled systems, and highlights the importance of intensive, long-term study of model coupled systems.
