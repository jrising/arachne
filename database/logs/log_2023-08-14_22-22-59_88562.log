In the discussion, we explored theoretical foundations and methods for studying coupled systems. Theoretical foundations include general systems theory, complex adaptive systems, resilience theory, hierarchy theory, and insights from various disciplines like ecology, economics, and sociology. Methods for studying coupled systems involve a multi-method approach, including data collection (e.g., interviews, surveys, remote sensing), data cleaning and management, analysis (using specialized statistical methods and geographic information systems), integration, and visualization. Systems modeling is widely used to understand complex relationships and dynamics. Finally, we discussed the importance of model coupled systems for studying system dynamics, interactions, and scale-dependency.
