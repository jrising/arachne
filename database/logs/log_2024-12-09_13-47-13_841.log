In a discussion, James requested an elaborate elevator pitch for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) to secure funding. I crafted a comprehensive pitch highlighting IMT's focus on global sustainability through market-based solutions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of building performance with public health and social resilience. Additionally, I underscored IMT's unique intersectional approach, which integrates economic, environmental, and policy expertise to drive efficiency improvements in the real estate sector. Later, James asked for a shortened version suitable for a cocktail party. I provided a succinct pitch emphasizing IMT's mission to enhance sustainability, appealing to potential supporters in a more casual context.
