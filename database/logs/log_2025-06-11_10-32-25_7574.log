James inquired about creating a `facet_grid` in `ggplot2` where the vertical space of each panel varies based on the number of y values. I confirmed that this can be achieved using `facet_grid()` with `space = "free_y"`, allowing panels to adjust their vertical space according to the ranges of y values. I provided a code example utilizing sample data to illustrate how to implement this. The key function call in the example was `facet_grid(rows = vars(group), scales = "free_y", space = "free_y")`, which successfully creates the desired effect. James was advised to adjust the data and aesthetics for his specific needs.
