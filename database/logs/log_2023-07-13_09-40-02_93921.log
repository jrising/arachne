The discussion revolved around the concepts of cost-sharing and release time in the context of research activities funded by grants. It was clarified that using University-paid research time for grant activities can be considered cost-sharing, where the University indirectly contributes to the project. Release time refers to the portion of time directly funded by the grant, during which the University allows the researcher to focus exclusively on the grant project. Universities may have specific policies and restrictions regarding cost-sharing and release time, and it is important to consult with the grant or sponsored programs office for guidance. Granting agencies like the National Science Foundation may also have their own rules on cost-sharing.
