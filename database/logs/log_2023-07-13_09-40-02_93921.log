James asked if spending University-paid research time on a grant can be considered cost sharing and if it relates to the term "release time." Arachne confirmed that University-paid research time spent on a grant activity can be seen as cost sharing, as it represents the University's indirect contribution to the project. Release time, on the other hand, refers to the portion of time directly funded by the grant, during which the University releases the researcher from their normal duties. Arachne advised James to consult with his University's grant or sponsored programs office for specific guidance on cost-sharing and release time, as policies and restrictions can vary. Granting agencies like the National Science Foundation may also have their own rules on voluntary committed cost-sharing.
