The discussion explores the distinction between renewable and non-renewable resources in the context of provisioning ecosystem services. Non-renewable resources like fossil fuels are contrasted with renewable resources like food and water.

Protecting bee populations is crucial for biodiversity and food security, emphasizing their significance beyond traditional resource extraction or replenishment.
