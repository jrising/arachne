In the conversation on 2023-11-26, James sought an adjective to describe "decision-making that is responsive to new evidence over time" for a grant proposal. He initially stated his goal as "Facilitate Timely Decision-Making," but a colleague suggested a more extensive phrase. I recommended the adjective "adaptive," emphasizing the idea of updating and responding to new information. This led to the refined phrase: "Facilitate Timely and Adaptive Decision-Making."
