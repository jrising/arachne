James inquired about how to respond to his Airbnb host, Claire, who welcomed him in French. I suggested saying, "Merci beaucoup ! Nous avons hâte de notre visite," to express gratitude and excitement for the visit. James then asked to include that he filled out a form that Claire had sent him. I provided an updated response: "Merci beaucoup ! Nous avons hâte de notre visite. J'ai rempli le formulaire," merging all relevant details seamlessly.
