James shared a link to job opportunities for graduates at the University of Delaware, which currently showed no available positions. I advised him to explore other avenues, set up alerts for new positions, reach out to faculty or departments, network with professionals, and attend career events to uncover hidden job prospects. The discussion highlighted the importance of proactive job searching strategies and leveraging personal and professional networks in the pursuit of career opportunities.
