James encountered an error when trying to import the `cdsapi` package after successfully installing it using `pip`. Arachne provided three common solutions to address the issue: 1) ensuring the correct Python version or environment is being used, 2) using the Python command to run `pip` and install the package directly, and 3) checking the 'PYTHONPATH' environment variable to ensure it includes the directory where the `cdsapi` module resides. Arachne advised against manually modifying the 'PYTHONPATH' variable and instead recommended using default Python paths or `pip` options. James was encouraged to try these solutions to resolve the import error.
