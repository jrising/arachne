In a conversation, James provided the first page of a PDF discussing systemic risks, emphasizing three ways scale is important. The text highlighted that systems can be vulnerable to external pressures, with local risks feeding into broader ones, and systemic risks having global consequences, especially regarding food security. Climate change was characterized as generating both acute shocks (black swans) and chronic changes (grey rhinos) impacting various systems. A direct risk, such as drought or heatwaves, affects specific areas, while systemic risks threaten the integrity of entire systems and have implications that extend beyond local contexts. The concept of systemic risk originated in finance and has broader applications.
