The conversation focused on the development of a grant proposal addressing the economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK and the benefits of adaptation actions. James outlined the proposal's goals, emphasizing the need for comprehensive climate damage scenarios specific to the UK and the integration of sector-specific impacts into a macroeconomic framework. Key objectives included enhancing understanding of UK macroeconomic impacts, quantifying fiscal risks, informing public spending decisions, and facilitating adaptive decision-making. A comprehensive risk assessment table was crafted, detailing potential organizational, data, stakeholder engagement, funding, technological, strategic alignment, global, and policy relevance risks, along with their likelihood, impact, and proposed mitigation strategies. This table aims to demonstrate the project's preparedness for challenges while ensuring a collaborative and informed approach.
