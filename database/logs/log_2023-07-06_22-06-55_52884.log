Jim Pappas, DelDOT Director of Transportation and Resiliency and Sustainability, discussed the creation of a division focused on resiliency issues due to increasing flooding. They are currently working on a planning project for a 16-mile stretch of Route 1 (SR1) to address flooding issues. Public input is being gathered to prioritize which segment of SR1 should be addressed first. Jim did not provide specific information on the need to prioritize roads or the cost of making roads resilient. The process of creating resilience in the DelDOT infrastructure is complex and costly, involving coordination with utilities, acquiring right of way, and obtaining permits.
