In a conversation with Jim Pappas, the DelDOT Director of Transportation and Resiliency and Sustainability, it was revealed that the division was established in response to the increasing frequency and severity of flooding in Delaware. Currently, DelDOT is working on a planning project to address flooding issues along Route 1 (SR1) through a grant from FEMA. The project aims to determine the best option for addressing flooding along a 16-mile stretch between Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island. There have been public meetings and consultations with towns to gather input. While there was no specific mention of prioritizing elevated roads, a public survey will help determine which segment of SR1 should be prioritized. The process of creating resilience in the DelDOT infrastructure is complex, involving coordination with utilities, acquiring right of way, and obtaining permits. The specific costs associated with elevation or resilience enhancement were not mentioned, but they would vary depending on the chosen solutions for each area.
