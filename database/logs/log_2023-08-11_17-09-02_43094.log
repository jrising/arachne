The provided text discusses the potential environmental impacts of offshore wind energy development on sea turtles and other marine wildlife. The identified activities and resources are as follows:

Activity 1: Offshore Wind Energy Development
- Description: Installation, operation, and decommissioning of wind turbines in marine environments
- Current Status: Ongoing, with potential for future expansion
- Spatial Extent: Inshore areas likely to be more affected in the near term
- Temporal Pattern: Construction, operations, and decommissioning may occur at different times
- Potential Expansion/Changes: Likely to grow as renewable energy efforts increase
- Stakeholders: Wind energy companies, environmental organizations, governmental and regulatory bodies, local communities
- Sources: The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), The Endangered Species Act (ESA), NMFS, USFWS, NOAA Office of Protected Resources

Activity 2: Sea Turtle Migration
- Description: Seasonal movement of sea turtles, including loggerhead and leatherback, along designated paths in the mid-Atlantic region
- Current Status: Ongoing, threatened by offshore wind development and fishing activities
- Spatial Extent: Migrate from Cape Cod south to Florida, higher densities near the shore
- Temporal Pattern: Seasonal (mainly summer, followed by fall)
- Potential Expansion/Changes: Potential changes in routes due to disturbance from offshore wind turbines and other human activities
- Stakeholders: Sea turtles, environmental organizations, governmental and regulatory bodies (NMFS, USFWS, NOAA Office of Protected Resources)
- Sources: The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), The Endangered Species Act (ESA), NMFS, USFWS, NOAA Office of Protected Resources

Activity 3: CO2 Reductions
- Description: Decreased use of fossil fuels and increased use of renewable energy (like wind power) to reduce carbon emissions
- Current Status: Ongoing as part of a global sustainability effort
- Spatial Extent: Global, though described in relation to mid-Atlantic offshore wind turbines
- Temporal Pattern: Benefits accrue over the long term
- Potential Expansion/Changes: Projected to continue and increase in the future due to ongoing environmental concerns
- Stakeholders: General public, environmental organizations, energy companies, governmental and regulatory bodies

Please note that additional information or further scrutiny of the provided text might be needed for a more thorough understanding of these activities and resources.
