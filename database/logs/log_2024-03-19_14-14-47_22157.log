James provided a list of publications by Xi Peng that he needed to represent in a table format. Arachne created a table showing the authors' last names, first names, institution (University of Delaware), and the latest publication year for each author. The table includes multiple authors with various publication dates in 2021, 2022, and 2023, showcasing Xi Peng's extensive contributions to research up to 2023.
