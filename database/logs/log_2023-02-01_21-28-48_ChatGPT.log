The conversation started with a question about the conditions for a predictor to be causally identified in econometrics. It was explained that a predictor is considered causally identified if there is a clear causal relationship between the predictor and the outcome, and if the relationship is not confounded by other factors. Spatial and temporal fixed effects in econometrics were then discussed as methods to deal with omitted variable bias. It was mentioned that spatial fixed effects control for unobserved characteristics specific to each spatial unit, while temporal fixed effects control for unobserved characteristics constant over time within a cross-sectional unit. The mathematical conditions for coefficients to be causally identified when including these fixed effects depend on the assumptions about the data generating process. Finally, the difference between a budget constraint and credit constraints in economics was explained, and a liquidity constraint was defined as a situation where an individual is unable to convert assets into cash quickly enough to meet their current spending needs.
