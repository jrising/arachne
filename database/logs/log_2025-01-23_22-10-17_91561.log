James sought guidance on using the `cleveref` package in LaTeX to modify appendix labels to "SI" instead of "Appendix." I provided a solution that involved redefining the `\crefname` and `\Crefname` macros within the document's preamble. This customization allows references to sections of the appendix to be labeled as "SI" (for lowercase) and "SI" (for uppercase) throughout the document, enhancing clarity and consistency in his formatting.
