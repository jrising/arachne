James Rising proposed a project to estimate current climate losses to support impacted countries in demanding support from developed countries at COP28. Using sophisticated statistical models and a machine learning approach, James aimed to produce country-specific macroeconomic losses from climate change. Arachne provided an outline for the final report, suggesting sections such as an executive summary, introduction and background, methodology, results and findings, case studies, discussion, conclusion, and references. The outline aimed for a concise and informative 8-page report. The report would summarize key findings, describe the methodology, present detailed results for different groupings, discuss implications, and conclude with the importance of understanding current macroeconomic losses for COP28 discussions.
