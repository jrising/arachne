In a discussion about the implications of dying intestate, I informed James that in Pennsylvania, intestate laws distribute assets primarily to a spouse and children, with a hierarchy extending to parents and siblings. We highlighted the importance of a will for controlling asset distribution, appointing guardians for minor children, avoiding potential family disputes, and expediting the probate process. James questioned the costs associated with intestate decisions compared to creating a will. I explained that intestate probate fees can range from 1% to 5% of the estate's value, plus attorney fees, while creating a will typically costs between $300 to $1,000. Ultimately, we concluded that a will can save heirs significant time and money in legal proceedings.
