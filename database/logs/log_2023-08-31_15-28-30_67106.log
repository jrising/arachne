To convert a datetime string to a number in R, the "lubridate" package can be used. The conversation provides a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this. After loading the package, the datetime string is converted to a datetime object using the `ymd_hms()` function. Then, the `as.numeric()` function is used to convert the datetime object to a Unix timestamp, which represents the number of seconds since 1970-01-01. The conversation also mentions the need to ensure that the "lubridate" package is installed, and provides the command `install.packages("lubridate")` for installation.
