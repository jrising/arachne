In a discussion about creating a glossary for a perspective article on climate risks, James requested suggestions for terms that might be misunderstood by readers from different fields. The assistant provided separate sections for physical and biological science terms and social science and economics terms. James then suggested additional terms, including exposure, biophysical/process-based model, reasons for concern (RFC), marginal effect, and econometric model. The assistant incorporated these suggestions and also clarified the definition of RFCs. The final glossary includes a range of terms that bridge the disconnect between the fields and enhance collaboration. It covers concepts such as radiative forcing, carbon sequestration, cap and trade, and economic damages, among others, promoting a better understanding of climate risks from both physical and social science perspectives.
