In a previous conversation, James asked for a phrase to describe the time something spends in a reservoir or bucket. Arachne provided the term "residence time" and explained its usage in hydrology, geology, or physical geography. Residence time refers to the average time a molecule of water (or another substance) stays within a particular reservoir or system. It helps researchers understand the dynamics and behavior of different elements within the system.
