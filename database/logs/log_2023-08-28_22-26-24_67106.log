In the conversation, James asked about the meaning of "Pilot Vessel" and the difference between a "Tug" and a "Towing Vessel". Arachne explained that a Pilot Vessel is used to transport maritime pilots who guide ships into harbors or through dangerous waters. Arachne also clarified that while "Tug" and "Towing Vessel" are often used interchangeably, there can be a distinction between them. A Tug is a craft designed to maneuver vessels by pushing or towing them, often used in harbors, whereas a Towing Vessel is a broader term that includes tugs but also other craft designed to pull or tow vessels. James also inquired about ships marked as "Reserved" or "Other Types", and Arachne explained that these categories are used for ships not fitting standard classifications or with undisclosed functionality. Additional data analysis may reveal more about their activities.
