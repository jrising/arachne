James inquired about generating "pretty breaks" related to quantiles of data using `scale_fill_fermenter` in `ggplot2`. I provided a step-by-step approach that involved calculating quantiles with the `quantile()` function, creating breaks based on these quantiles, and then applying them in `scale_fill_fermenter`. An example was included, demonstrating how to generate quantiles, set breaks, and configure the ggplot with a color scale. The example illustrated the use of `length.out` for adjusting the number of breaks and recommended the use of `percent_format` for prettier labels, ultimately achieving visually appealing breaks that reflect the data distribution.
