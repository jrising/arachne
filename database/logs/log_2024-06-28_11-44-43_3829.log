James inquired about performing k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) prediction for continuous dependent variables in R. The AI assistant provided a detailed step-by-step guide using the `knn.reg` function from the `FNN` package, including data preparation, normalization, model application, and evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE). A concise example with the `iris` dataset was shared for reference, emphasizing the importance of adapting the code to specific data. The discussion aimed to empower James to implement k-NN regression efficiently for predictive modeling in R.
