In a previous conversation, James asked about the significance of 1.2 inches of rain and whether it would be considered a lot. Arachne explained that the perception of whether 1.2 inches is a lot varies depending on factors such as the region's average precipitation, climatic conditions, and local infrastructure. She advised comparing it with historical data, local norms, and drainage capacity to gain a clearer understanding. James then asked if the distribution of rain throughout the day would make it light or heavy. Arachne explained that if the rain is evenly distributed, it would generally be considered a moderate amount of rainfall, falling within the range of a steady rain. She mentioned the effects of moderate rainfall, such as wetting the ground and potentially causing minor runoff or localized flooding. Arachne emphasized the subjectivity of rainfall intensity perception and suggested consulting local weather forecasts for more accurate assessments.
