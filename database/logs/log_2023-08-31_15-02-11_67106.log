From 2011 to 2020, Delaware's marine recreational fishing involved an average of 216 anglers annually, with a majority (125) coming from out-of-state. Shore fishing was the most popular, accounting for around 1.48 million trips, followed by private boating with approximately 788,000 trips. Atlantic croaker was the most commonly harvested species (average of 230 thousand fish), while summer flounder and bluefish were also popular targets. Tautog and black sea bass were notable for both their harvest and release numbers. Overall, these findings highlight the significance of recreational fishing in Delaware's marine waters.
