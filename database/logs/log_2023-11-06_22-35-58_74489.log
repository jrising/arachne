This discussion centered around James Rising's proposal to estimate current climate losses experienced by countries due to climate change. James provided details about the project, including the need for high-quality estimates to support impacted countries' demands for assistance from developed nations. Arachne responded by providing an analysis of the results and findings related to GDP losses and temperature increase, variability across individual countries, and a comparative analysis of the US and China. In response to James' request, Arachne added a section on capital losses, highlighting the impact on produced capital and renewable capital, and emphasizing the heterogeneity of these losses across income groups and regions. The discussion concluded with a mention of the limitations of the analysis.
