This conversation focused on identifying resources and activities that should be taken into account for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan under development by Delaware, using a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy as a reference. The identified resources and activities include:

1. Offshore Wind Projects: Construction, operation, and decommissioning of wind turbines. Potential impacts on wildlife and potential expansion towards deeper waters with floating turbine technology.

2. Endangered, Threatened, and Protected Species: Wildlife that may be affected by offshore wind development. Wildlife protection laws focus on the population level, and not all impacts to individuals trigger Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).

3. Cold-Water/Deep-Water Corals: Ecologically important habitats found in canyons and along the continental slope. Act as indicators for climate change. Potential threats from commercial fishing, drilling, and offshore wind development.

4. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH): Managed areas crucial for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, and growth. May be affected by offshore wind development.

5. Important Benthic Habitat Features: Features of the underwater environment that support marine life and can conflict with offshore infrastructure development. Cold-water corals and other significant biodiversity present.

6. Artificial Reefs: Created reefs that provide habitat for marine life. No direct threats or potential impacts from wind development mentioned.

Overall, the discussion focused on the potential environmental impacts of offshore wind projects, the protection of endangered species and essential fish habitats, and the presence of important benthic habitat features and artificial reefs. The key stakeholders identified include offshore wind energy companies, environmental organizations, and government agencies responsible for wildlife and fisheries management.
