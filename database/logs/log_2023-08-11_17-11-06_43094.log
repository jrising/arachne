The section of the report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy highlights the potential environmental impacts of offshore wind projects, including impacts on endangered species, cold-water corals, and essential fish habitats. It emphasizes the need to consider biologically significant impacts at the population level and the importance of managing for the long-term viability of each species. The report also mentions the presence of artificial reefs and important benthic habitat features that may conflict with offshore infrastructure development. Overall, the section provides valuable information on the potential impacts and considerations for offshore wind development in relation to the marine environment.
