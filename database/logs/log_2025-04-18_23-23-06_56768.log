In the discussion, James sought to categorize key parameters from a climate model into "potential barriers" to implementing mitigation policy: technological, economic, social, and institutional/policy. I identified parameters affecting these barriers, such as the **Endogenous technical change effect** and **Learning-by-doing effect** for technological barriers, while **Adoption cost** and **Maximum mitigation rate and time** represented economic barriers. Social barriers included **Network homophily** and **Social-norm effect**, which influence public acceptance of policies. Lastly, **Status quo bias** and **Political interest feedback** were categorized under institutional/policy barriers, highlighting challenges in policy implementation. This analysis aimed to inform strategies for overcoming obstacles in climate mitigation efforts.
