James inquired about a suitable "coversheet" template for organizing important documents like living wills and passports, as well as key locations. In response, I provided a detailed template that includes owner information, a summary of document locations, expiration dates, and sections for keys, emergency contacts, medical information, digital assets instructions, and executor details. I emphasized the importance of regular updates and maintaining the coversheet in a secure yet accessible location, along with a note advising consultation with a legal professional for detailed advice.
