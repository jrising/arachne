James inquired about the sensitivity of the Gini index to changes in the top percentile. Arachne explained that the Gini index is sensitive to changes across the income distribution but less so to changes in the extreme tails. However, significant increases in the top 1% can impact the Gini coefficient if disparities in the lower percentiles remain. Arachne suggested using complementary measures for a detailed view of income inequality when focusing on the top percentile.
