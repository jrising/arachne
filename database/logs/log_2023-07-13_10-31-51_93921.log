In a previous conversation, James asked if there is an equivalent to the `colSums()` function in Julia. I informed him that the equivalent function in Julia is the `sum()` function, which can calculate column sums using the `dims` argument. I provided him with an example code snippet demonstrating how to use `sum()` to calculate column sums in Julia.
