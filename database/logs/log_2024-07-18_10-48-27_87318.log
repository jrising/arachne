James sought help in RShiny to display a table with a dynamic dropdown selection feature. Assistance included setting up the UI, server logic, handling dropdown options derived from a table column, and styling the table with CSS. Detailed guidance was provided on subseting, rearranging data, including row and column names, alternating row shading, and incorporating external CSS files. The discussions focused on enhancing user experience and customization in RShiny applications.
