James inquired about the "string things" found in oranges, seeking clarification on their terminology. I responded that these structures are known as "vascular bundles," which play a crucial role in nutrient and water transportation within the fruit. I elaborated that they consist of xylem and phloem tissues, essential for the orange's growth and development. Additionally, I noted that the visibility of these fibrous structures can vary based on the orange's variety and ripeness.
