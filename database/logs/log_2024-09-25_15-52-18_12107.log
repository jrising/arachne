James sought help to configure his QNAP NAS for read/write access on his Linux server via NFS. I provided a detailed step-by-step guide, including checking export permissions on the NAS, verifying NFS export options, ensuring correct mount options on Linux, checking Linux side permissions, and confirming network and firewall settings. The solution aimed to resolve the read-only file system issue by adjusting permissions both on the NAS and Linux server. James was encouraged to try the suggested steps and report back any persistent issues.
