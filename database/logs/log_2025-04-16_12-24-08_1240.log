James discussed the concept of religion as a means to promote truth, specifically emphasizing that by "truth," he meant evidence-based policy. He wanted to highlight that this approach contributes to the improvement of well-being globally. After several updates, the final note reads: "Religion as a means to promote truth (evidence as the basis for policy) and the improvement of well-being, which means improving welfare across the globe." James confirmed the note met his needs, and the conversation ended positively.
