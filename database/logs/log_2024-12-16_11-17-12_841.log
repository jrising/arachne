In a past conversation, James inquired about how Rockwool could further support the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). I outlined several potential avenues for collaboration: 

1. **Funding and Partnerships:** Continued financial support for IMT initiatives.
2. **Product Innovation:** Developing energy-efficient products to demonstrate commitment to sustainability.
3. **Advocacy and Policy Influence:** Leveraging industry presence to promote energy efficiency policies.
4. **Education and Training:** Initiating educational programs for stakeholders on energy efficiency benefits.
5. **Collaboration on Research and Studies:** Partnering with IMT on research to understand market dynamics.

I emphasized that this symbiotic relationship could enhance both Rockwool's sustainability efforts and its market standing.
