In a previous discussion, James inquired about international spillover effects in economic systems, specifically regarding Domar weights derived from Input-Output (I/O) tables. I explained that these weights quantify the importance of various sectors by relating their total sales to GDP, aiding in understanding how shocks in one sector can affect others. Domar weights are crucial for estimating "with trade" losses, which can be calculated using the equation \( L = \sum_{i=1}^{N} D_i \cdot \Delta S_i \), where \( D_i \) is the Domar weight and \( \Delta S_i \) is the shock to sector sales. This helps assess the broader economic impacts of localized disturbances, incorporating both direct and indirect effects on trade and interdependencies across sectors.
