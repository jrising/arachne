The discussion involved creating a paper section explaining the principles behind a code relating modeled fish flows to observed recruitment. The code details steps like data loading, cleaning, average catch calculation, combining results, and predicting catches through regression coefficients. A key function, `estimate.coeffs`, estimates coefficients using non-negative least squares and area-based priors for biological interpretation. The method aims to bridge modeled fish flows and observed recruitment, offering insights for fisheries management.
