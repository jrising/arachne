James taught a class on Climate Change Economics, focusing on Chapter 7 of the Stern Review. The chapter discusses historical and future drivers of greenhouse gas emissions, the need for deep emissions cuts, and the economic implications of stabilization efforts. The Stern Review emphasizes the correlation between economic development and emissions, the uneven distribution of emissions across countries, and the importance of early climate action for long-term economic growth. Key points include the projected rise in emissions from developing countries, estimated costs of stabilization, and the potential wider benefits of climate policies. The multiple-choice questions provided by Arachne helped reinforce understanding of the chapter's key messages.
