In a previous conversation, James asked how to get the covariance matrix from a regression command in Stata. I provided the steps to obtain the covariance matrix using the `estat vce` command after running the regression. I also mentioned that larger values for `matsize` and `maxiter` might be needed for models with many predictors. Additionally, I highlighted that the availability of `estat vce` depends on the Stata version and the options set in the `reg` command. I offered further assistance if needed.
