In a previous conversation, James asked for help in reducing the complexity of his Random Forest model while maintaining its quality. Arachne provided several strategies, including adjusting significance levels, limiting tree depth, setting a higher minimum sample size in terminal nodes, restricting the number of variables considered for splitting, pruning the trees, and adjusting the leaf size. In a subsequent question, James asked for a reasonable limit for the number of samples in terminal leaves. Arachne advised considering factors such as the balance between bias and variance, data availability, class imbalance, and interpretability. A general guideline suggested setting the minimum leaf size between 1% and 5% of the total dataset size and emphasized the importance of experimentation and tuning to find the optimal value. Arachne reminded James to consider this parameter in conjunction with other choices and the overall model evaluation process.
