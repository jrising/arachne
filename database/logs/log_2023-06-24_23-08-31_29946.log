** In this conversation, James seeks assistance in debugging an issue with his Flask application running on Passenger. The assistant provides a step-by-step approach to identify and resolve the problem, including inspecting log files, testing POST requests, disabling middleware, tracing application code, and checking app server settings. James also asks about increasing the log level of Passenger and configuring it to log errors to the Apache error log. The assistant explains the steps to achieve this and suggests adjusting the log paths and names as needed. James encounters an error while setting the Passenger log level, and the assistant explains that it can only be set in certain contexts in the Apache configuration. The assistant concludes by providing an example of setting the Passenger log level in a `<VirtualHost>` block.
