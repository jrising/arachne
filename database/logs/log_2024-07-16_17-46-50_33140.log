James participated in a coastal risk and resilience study interview as the mayor of Fenwick, Delaware. He discussed the history of coastal flooding in the area, noting an increase in events and "sunny day" flooding. Most impacts were seen on the bayside due to tidal surges and heavy rainfall. Concerns included safe access to homes, especially on the bayside during high tide events. The town focused on resiliency measures like raising homes, engineering studies, and federal grants. Planning for the future involved improving stormwater management, implementing valves in pipes, and developing detailed GIS mapping for infrastructure assessment. Engineering studies would guide specific actions like raising bulkheads and installing pumps, along with exploring grant opportunities.
