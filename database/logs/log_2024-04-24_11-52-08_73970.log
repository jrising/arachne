James requested assistance on how to read a space-delimited file with a variable number of spaces in R. I provided guidance on using the `read.table()` function with an empty string as the separator to interpret consecutive spaces as delimiters. I cautioned about potential issues if data in the file contains spaces and suggested adjusting the parsing strategy accordingly.
