In the discussion, James Rising sought to draft a response to an email from Jingwen Jiao, who expressed interest in pursuing a PhD under his supervision at the University of Delaware. James highlighted the relevance of Jingwen's strong background in statistics and environmental economics but noted the need to direct her to the new system for connecting prospective students with advisors, emphasizing the importance of filling out an online form. He advised mentioning his name in her application if she was well-qualified for quantitative research. James also clarified the funding situation for the PhD and provided a brief template email for a response. The goal was to address Jingwen's interests while guiding her through the application process.
