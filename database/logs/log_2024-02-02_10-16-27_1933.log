In the conversation, James asked if there is a way to export the full history changes list of a file in Google Drive. Arachne responded that while the Google Drive API provides information about revisions made to a file (such as who made the edit and the time of the revision), it does not include specifics about what changes were enacted in each revision. Arachne suggested using the 'Suggesting' mode or 'Version History' in Google Docs to track changes or compare versions. If James needs to track specific changes in a format outside of Google Docs, he might need to copy the versions and use a different tool, such as a 'diff' tool, to see the differences between them.
