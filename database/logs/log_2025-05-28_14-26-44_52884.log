James received an email from Muallimul Islam, a prospective graduate student from Bangladesh, expressing interest in joining his research team at the University of Delaware. Muallimul highlighted his research on how climate change affects fish health and fishery systems, alongside his academic qualifications and experience. In response, James drafted a professional email thanking Muallimul for his interest while informing him that applications for September had closed, with the next application cycle starting in October. James invited Muallimul to discuss his research interests further via Zoom if desired, providing a scheduling link.
