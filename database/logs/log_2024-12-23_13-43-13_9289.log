James sought advice on how to draft a request for reconsideration after his journal paper was rejected, noting that the reviews did not seem to justify this decision. I provided a structured approach for the request, emphasizing professionalism and clarity. The guidance included elements such as addressing the editor personally, acknowledging reviewers' feedback, clarifying any misunderstandings, and highlighting the strengths and contributions of the original manuscript. A template was provided to assist James in composing his request, with emphasis on remaining respectful and open for further discussion with the journal.
