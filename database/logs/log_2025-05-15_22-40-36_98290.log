James inquired about the standard practice of resampling results from multiple models in a meta-analysis using \( R^2 \) and its relation to inverse variance weighting. I clarified that while \( R^2 \) is informative for model fit, it is not the conventional measure used in meta-analysis, which typically relies on effect sizes weighted by their variance. Using \( R^2 \) directly for resampling does not align with the principles of inverse variance weighting. I suggested considering a hierarchical meta-regression analysis if he wishes to incorporate \( R^2 \) as a covariate and invited him to elaborate on his reasoning for using \( R^2 \) for further tailored suggestions.
