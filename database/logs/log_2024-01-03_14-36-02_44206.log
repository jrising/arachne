James asked if it's possible to install a previous version of a package in R. Arachne provided steps on how to do this using the `devtools` package and the function `install_version()`. She also mentioned that not all older versions may be available on CRAN and that installing an older version may require satisfying version-specific dependencies. Arachne concluded by mentioning that installing an older version will overwrite a newer version if it's already installed, which should be considered if other work depends on the newer features.
