James discussed a project involving a system for ethical purchasing, where users could support companies aligned with their values. The project included creating a Ruby on Rails application with basic models and views for tracking company impacts. Completed tasks included database setup, basic CRUD operations, and some UI development. Incomplete aspects were evaluating companies, integrating purchase data sources, user account implementation, and donation/reporting features. Notable contributions were database setup, controllers/views for company management, a purchase review interface, initial test cases, and custom UI elements. Keywords: ethical purchasing, Rails application, CRUD operations, database migrations, user interface.
