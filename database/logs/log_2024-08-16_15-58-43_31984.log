James asked for a basic Julia line to create a scatter plot with Plots.jl. Arachne provided a code snippet demonstrating how to plot a simple scatter plot using Julia, specifying that `scatter(x, y)` should be used with arrays `x` and `y` containing data points. Arachne also gave an example with data arrays and highlighted the potential for customization using different attributes like marker size and color.
