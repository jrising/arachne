In a previous discussion, James asked about the equation for an Archimedean spiral with equal distances between subsequent points. The assistant clarified that the traditional Archimedean spiral does not meet this condition, and suggested that a logarithmic or equiangular spiral may be closer to what was described. However, it was mentioned that neither of these spirals can perfectly satisfy the equal distance condition. The assistant offered further assistance if more specific information was needed.
