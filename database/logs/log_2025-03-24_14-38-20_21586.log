In this discussion, James sought advice on organizing a list of functional groups of fish, questioning whether to consolidate sharks and rays and consider habitat-based organization for the remaining groups. I suggested categorizing them into three main sections: 1) Sharks and Rays (grouped by size), 2) Fish by Habitat (demersals, pelagics, and others with specific associations), and 3) Other Fish Types (including reef-associated fish and flatfishes). This proposed structure aimed to improve clarity by highlighting ecological similarities and providing an overview of size and environmental interactions.
