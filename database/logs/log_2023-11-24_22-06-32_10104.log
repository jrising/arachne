In a previous conversation, James asked about constructing a distinction between rich and poor countries based on GDP per capita. The AI assistant explained that the World Bank provides income classifications, which are subject to annual updates. As of 2023, the classifications are:
1. Low-income economies: GNI per capita ≤ $1,045.
2. Lower middle-income economies: $1,046 ≤ GNI per capita ≤ $4,095.
3. Upper middle-income economies: $4,096 ≤ GNI per capita ≤ $12,695.
4. High-income economies: GNI per capita ≥ $12,696.
The assistant clarified that while GDP per capita and GNI per capita are similar, they have slight differences. Additionally, the assistant highlighted that other factors, such as the Human Development Index (HDI) or the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), can provide further insight into a country's level of development.
