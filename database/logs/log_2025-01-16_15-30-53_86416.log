James sought a replacement for the `importShapefile` function from the `PBSmapping` package, which imported ESRI shapefiles as simple dataframes. The replacement function was developed using the `sf` and `dplyr` packages, allowing options such as reading associated `.dbf` files and preserving projection. He requested that the new function include a `PolyData` attribute to store polygon attributes. Modifications were made to handle multiple geometry types robustly and to allow use of a basename (e.g., `shapefiles/map`) for the shapefile input, appending the `.shp` extension as needed and checking for required file existence.
