James inquired about obtaining uncertainties for coefficient estimates when using the `nnls` package in R for non-negative least squares regression. I provided guidance on using a bootstrap method to approximate uncertainties by repeatedly resampling the data and re-running the regression. A code example and cautionary note on the method's assumptions were given, highlighting the potential limitations and the importance of consulting experts for validation.
