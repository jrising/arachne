James asked for guidance on removing the "SQL_CACHE" statement from multiple PHP files on Linux, as it is no longer supported by MySQL. Arachne provided a solution using the `sed` command, which can easily find and replace text in files. The command `find . -name "*.php" -type f -exec sed -i 's/SQL_CACHE//g' {} \;` was provided, with an explanation of each component. Arachne also offered some additional advice, such as testing the command on a small subset of files first and using the `-i.bak` option to create backup files.
