James asked if there was a way to see who moved files out of a shared folder in Google Drive. Arachne explained that Google Drive does not provide a straightforward way to track this activity, but suggested checking the activity overview on the Google Drive website for information on who added, edited, or viewed a file. However, this may not help in the case of file movement as Google Drive does not log that specific activity. Arachne also advised setting file access to "View only" or "Comment only" to prevent unauthorized relocation or deletion of shared files in the future.
