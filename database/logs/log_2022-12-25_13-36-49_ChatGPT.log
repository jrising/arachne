The discussion was about whether children can take communion in Lutheran churches. In the Lutheran tradition, children are generally welcome to receive Holy Communion after they have been baptized and received instruction in the Christian faith. Some Lutheran churches may have specific guidelines or requirements for children to receive Communion, such as completing a certain amount of instruction or reaching a certain age. It is advised to check with the local Lutheran church for specific practices and requirements.
