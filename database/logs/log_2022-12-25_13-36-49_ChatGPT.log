Children are generally welcome to receive Holy Communion in Lutheran churches. The Lutheran Church teaches that in Holy Communion, Christians receive the true body and blood of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins and the strengthening of their faith. Children who have been baptized and have received instruction in the Christian faith are generally considered ready to receive Communion. In many Lutheran churches, children are encouraged to participate in Communion starting at a young age, either by receiving a blessing or by receiving the bread and wine. However, the practice of children receiving Communion may vary among different Lutheran churches and traditions, and there may be specific guidelines or requirements in place. It is advisable to consult with your local Lutheran church for more information on their practices and requirements.
