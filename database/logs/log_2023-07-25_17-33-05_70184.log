James asked for advice on how to prepare chicken sausage for his son, who prefers plain food. The assistant provided a simple pan-cooked recipe that focused on emphasizing the unique flavor of the sausage. It recommended preheating a skillet, adding a small amount of olive oil, and cooking the sausages on medium heat for about 12-15 minutes until browned and fully cooked. The sausages should then be allowed to rest on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil before being cut into small pieces for easy handling. The assistant suggested that if James's son found this too plain or enjoyed it, they could explore other recipes to enhance the flavors.
