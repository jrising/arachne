When working with a log-log regression (log(y) = a + b log(x)), corrections similar to those used in log-linear regressions can be applied for predicting new values. The retransformation from log scale to original scale requires careful consideration of retransformation bias, especially when dealing with varying variances across x values. It's crucial to validate model specifications and error structures before making predictions and to consider more sophisticated methods if needed.
