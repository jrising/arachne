James inquired about a philosopher who emphasized the need to stand up for what's right, while acknowledging the challenge of identifying what is right. He associated this idea with Simone de Beauvoir. I responded by clarifying that while no exact quote matched his wording, the themes he mentioned align with De Beauvoir's existentialist philosophy, which stresses personal responsibility and the continuous effort to discern ethical actions. I recommended her book "The Ethics of Ambiguity" for deeper exploration of these concepts. James concluded the conversation with a simple "Thanks!"
