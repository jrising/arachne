The discussion focused on whether clustered standard errors are heteroskedastically consistent. James inquired about this statistical issue, and I confirmed that clustered standard errors indeed are heteroskedastically consistent. I explained that they are robust to both heteroskedasticity and within-cluster correlation. This characteristic allows them to adjust for variability in errors across observations and correlations within clusters, making them especially useful in panel data analysis or clustered data scenarios.
