The conversation involves James Rising's correspondence with Onyinyechi Aghanwa, a prospective PhD student interested in Marine Studies at the University of Delaware. Onyinyechi outlines her impressive academic background and research focus on the impacts of climate change on coastal areas, seeking James's supervision. James clarifies program offerings (PhD in Marine Policy versus Environmental Economics), advises on funding applications, and recommends alternative faculty contacts. After a successful discussion regarding reapplying, Onyinyechi later requests assistance for a waiver for the application fee due to financial difficulties. James suggests filling out a Program Interest Form, explaining he has limited influence on fee waivers but is supportive of her application aspirations. The conversation reflects mentorship, support, and challenges in the academic application process.
