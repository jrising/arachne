The TADF and TADA products of TransformAr currently lack effective utilization of insights from WP2. The process, intended to draw from WP2, fails to engage with its structure and results, necessitating a stronger integration. Clarity is needed regarding the timeline for tool updates based on WP2. Additionally, the origin of available KPI values remains unspecified, which should be addressed for transparency. Lastly, the characterization of the tool as a “socioeconomic impact assessment” is misleading; it functions mainly as a record collection rather than an integrated assessment tool, highlighting a need for a more accurate description or enhanced capabilities.
