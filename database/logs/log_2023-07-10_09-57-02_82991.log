In this conversation, James asked what it means when a paper on climate data says it "conservatively re-grids" data. Arachne explained that conservative re-gridding is a method for translating information between grids of different sizes or shapes while preserving certain properties of the original data. The term "conservative" refers to the process preserving the total amount of data across the entire grid. It ensures that no data is lost or gained during the re-gridding process and is used when we want to preserve the physical meaning and constraints of the data while changing the resolution of the grid.
