In a previous conversation, James asked about the meaning of "conservative re-gridding" in a climate data paper. Arachne explained that conservative re-gridding refers to a specific method of translating information between grids of different sizes or shapes while preserving certain properties of the original data. Specifically, the total amount of the data across the entire grid remains constant after re-gridding, ensuring that no data is lost or gained in the process. This approach is used to preserve the physical meaning and constraints of the data while changing the resolution of the grid. It can be more complex than other re-gridding strategies, as it requires careful weighting of data points to ensure conservation.
