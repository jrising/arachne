The user asked for guidance on how to respond to a job application prompt about building systems and implementing structure in grantmaking, as well as incorporating the principles of solidarity philanthropy. The assistant explained that the employer is looking for evidence of experience in implementing organized processes, allocation principles, tracking methods, and communication strategies in grantmaking. Solidarity philanthropy, also known as trust-based philanthropy, involves actively ceding power to grantee communities and organizations by providing multi-year, unrestricted funding, simplifying applications and reporting, being transparent and responsive, actively soliciting feedback, and collaborating with other funders. The user was advised to describe how their systems incorporate trust-based philanthropy principles and the impacts they have had on grantmaking, while balancing established systems with innovation.
