James sought guidance on responding to a job application prompt regarding the implementation of structure within grantmaking and the incorporation of solidarity philanthropy or trust-based philanthropy. The assistant explained that employers are looking for evidence of experience in implementing structure and systems in grantmaking, which includes designing processes, allocation principles, tracking methods, and communication strategies. Solidarity philanthropy, also known as trust-based philanthropy, was defined as an approach that involves funders ceding power to the organizations they support and following six principles: offering multi-year, unrestricted funding, doing the homework, simplifying applications and reporting, being transparent and responsive, actively soliciting feedback, and collaborating with other funders. The assistant advised James to illustrate how his systems align with these principles and to describe the impacts they have had, balancing adherence to established systems with innovation and adaptation for philanthropic goals.
