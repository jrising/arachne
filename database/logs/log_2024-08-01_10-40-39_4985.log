In a conversation about developing a Shiny app for coastal risks in Delaware using high-resolution raster data, the AI assistant advised using Leaflet for visuals and provided guidance on loading GeoTIFF data, converting it for Leaflet, adding a basemap, and addressing slow rendering. The user inquired about tempfile usage, PNG generation, and performance issues with leaflet(). The assistant clarified the benefits of tempfile(), advised skipping PNG creation, and suggested tiling for speed. Errors with color scaling and missing gdalUtils for tiling were discussed, with solutions provided for managing color scale warnings and potential alternatives to gdalUtils.
