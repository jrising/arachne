In a previous conversation, James assigned a reading to his students on the comparison between Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) and Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFs). Arachne provided multiple-choice questions to evaluate the students' understanding of the reading. James requested edits to two questions, and Arachne provided revised versions. The first question asked about a characteristic of successful FMOs and MEAs, and the revised version clarified the characteristic and provided accurate answer choices. The second question asked about an advantage of TURF systems over ITQs, and the revised version provided answer choices that all sounded like advantages of TURF systems.
