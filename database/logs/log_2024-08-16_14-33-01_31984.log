James requested help to disable mouse-over interactivity in a Plotly plot within a Shiny app. Arachne provided a solution by advising James to set the `hoverinfo` attribute to 'none' for each trace to disable hover labels and use `config()` to hide the mode bar with zoom controls. Arachne also shared a code sample demonstrating how to implement these changes in a Shiny app using `plot_ly` and the `config()` function. This method allowed James to display the plot statically, without any interactive features, meeting his requirement.
