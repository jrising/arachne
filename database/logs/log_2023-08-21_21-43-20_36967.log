Delaware's marine waters contain diverse habitats, such as shoals and coral regions. Shoals are modeled features found seaward of the U.S. Submerged Lands Act Boundary and are identified using the Shoal Map Assessment Tool for Essential Fish Habitat (ShoalMATE). The continental shelf's canyons are home to deep-sea corals, including stony and soft corals. Stony corals create complex communities with calcium-based skeletons, supporting various fish and invertebrate species. Soft corals, like sea fans, provide habitat without calcium-based structures. Predictive models based on environmental characteristics help identify suitable coral habitat and inform conservation and mapping efforts.
