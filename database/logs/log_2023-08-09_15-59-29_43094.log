In a previous conversation, James asked how to do matrix multiplication in Python. The assistant recommended using the NumPy library and provided an example code snippet. The assistant explained that the dot product of two arrays can be obtained using the `np.dot()` function, which returns the matrix multiplication for 2-D arrays. The assistant also mentioned that the number of columns in the first matrix should match the number of rows in the second matrix for multiplication to be possible. The response provided a clear and concise explanation of how to perform matrix multiplication in Python using NumPy.
