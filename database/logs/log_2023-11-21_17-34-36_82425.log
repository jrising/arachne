Loss and Damage, as understood by the UNFCCC, refers to the costs and impacts of climate change events that cannot be prevented through adaptation and mitigation efforts. It has three main elements: risk reduction, risk retention, and risk transfer. Loss and Damage was officially recognized in 2010 and further refined in 2013 through the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM). The Paris Agreement recognized Loss and Damage as an integral part of climate action but did not include provisions for compensation by developed countries. The availability of financial support for Loss and Damage is not specified, and it is primarily addressed through existing financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF). However, the issue of financial support for Loss and Damage is a matter of ongoing negotiations and differing opinions among countries. The level of financial support will be determined through future agreements and commitments under the UNFCCC.
