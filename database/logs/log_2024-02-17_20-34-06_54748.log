In Delaware, surf fishing involves anglers casting into the surf from the beach, with vehicles used for gear transport and as a base of operations, not for fishing. Driving on beaches is convenient for accessing different fishing spots, but regulated to protect the environment, requiring permits and adherence to rules. The dialogue continues on minimizing impacts on beaches and marine ecosystems.
