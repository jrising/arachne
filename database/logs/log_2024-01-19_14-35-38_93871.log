In this conversation, James asked for guidance on how to include a page number in a citation for a direct quote from Brady and Marsh (2013). Arachne provided two APA-style options: including the page number within parentheses after the year in the in-text citation, or including the page number in a footnote citation. Arachne also noted that citation style standards vary across fields, so it's important to check the specific style guide being used.
