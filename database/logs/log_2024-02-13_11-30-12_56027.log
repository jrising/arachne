In this conversation, James asked where the surname "van den Belt" should be alphabetized in a bibliography. Arachne explained that in most English-language bibliographies, the name should be alphabetized under "V," treating "van den Belt" as a single unit. However, in a Dutch-language context or according to Dutch tradition, the name may be alphabetized under "B." Arachne suggested checking local conventions or specific style guides for the correct practice, as it can vary.
