In this discussion, James assigned a reading from the article "Governing the global fisheries commons" by Pablo Paniagua and Veeshan Rayamajhee. He sought multiple-choice questions for a quiz to gauge student comprehension. The article highlights the complexities of global fisheries depletion framed as nested collective action problems, emphasizing the need for multi-tiered governance solutions inspired by Elinor Ostrom's work. Key topics included the ineffectiveness of broad or narrow solutions to overfishing, the adverse impacts of fishing subsidies, and the potential of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) alongside community-based approaches. Ultimately, James received a set of tailored questions addressing these core themes to assess student understanding of the material.
