The EMPOWER project aims to implement a comprehensive Community Benefit Plan (CBP) to empower the offshore wind workforce and coastal stakeholder communities. This involves creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, developing fellowship and mentorship programs, and engaging communities through public sessions and advisory boards. Energy equity will be addressed by partnering with local businesses, conducting environmental impact studies, and increasing outreach to minority communities. The project also focuses on investing in America's workforce by expanding vocational training and curriculum development. Performance will be tracked using metrics, and knowledge sharing will enhance America's technical capabilities and leadership in offshore wind energy. The summary has been condensed to fit within limited space.
