The discussion focused on condensing the technical scope of the EMPOWER project's Community Benefit Plan (CBP) for a grant proposal to the DOE. The technical scope involves empowering the offshore wind workforce and coastal stakeholder communities through various strategies, such as promoting diversity and inclusion, developing fellowship and mentorship programs, engaging coastal communities, addressing energy equity, and investing in America's workforce. The objective was to shorten the technical scope while maintaining essential information and key elements of the plan.
