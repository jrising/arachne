The discussion centered around James C. Scott's reading, "Seeing Like a State," which explores the simplification of knowledge and control by state institutions utilizing scientific forestry as a key example. Scott highlights how this "tunnel vision” enables powerful institutions to achieve a manageable understanding of reality—often disregarding the complexities of nature and local practices. Key points included the fiscal prioritization of forests, leading to an abstract view of trees merely as timber resources, and the negative ecological consequences, termed "forest death" (Waldsterben), resulting from monoculture practices. The notion of legibility was also underscored, with cadastral maps serving as tools for states to manage land and taxation with clarity, often at the expense of local customs and ecological diversity. The conversation aimed to unpack these themes of simplification, manipulation, and the resulting impacts on both natural and social systems.
