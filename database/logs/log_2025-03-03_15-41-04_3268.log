James inquired about working with a sparse matrix in R, specifically a `dgCMatrix`, to identify which columns have non-zero values in a given row without converting it to a dense vector. I provided a method using the matrix's `i` and `p` slots to extract non-zero column indices efficiently. Additionally, he asked about converting to a row-oriented sparse matrix (`dgRMatrix`), and I explained that transposition alone doesnâ€™t change the underlying structure, so a conversion is necessary for optimization. Lastly, James wanted to know how to convert a sparse matrix into an "i, j, x" format. I outlined a straightforward approach to extract row indices, column indices, and values, converting them to a data frame format for clarity.
