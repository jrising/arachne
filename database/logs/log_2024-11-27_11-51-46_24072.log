In a discussion, James Rising presented a final report draft titled "Drivers of Country-Level Social Costs of Carbon" intended for funders. The report, which is a precursor to an academic paper, outlines updates to the PAGE-2020 integrated assessment model that enhance its ability to estimate and analyze social costs associated with carbon emissions at a country level. Key points highlighted include heterogeneity in climate damages, improvements in the model for climate uncertainty, dynamic vulnerability, calibration of country-level abatement costs, and incorporation of sub-national damage distributions. Suggestions for editing focused on refining clarity, structure, language, and citation accuracy. Emphasis was placed on ensuring the report is both technically sound and accessible to a broad audience.
