In a recent conversation, James asked the assistant to list the episodes of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" that revolve around the Eagles. The assistant provided a list of three episodes: "The Gang Goes on Family Fight," "The Gang Beats Boggs: Ladies Reboot," and "The Gang Wins the Big Game." These episodes showcase the gang's avid fandom of the Philadelphia Eagles and their participation in various events and challenges related to the team. This information will likely be helpful to James if he is a fan of the show and wants to watch episodes centered around the Eagles.
