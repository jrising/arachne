James inquired about the Andromeda Galaxy's trajectory, specifically how soon it might collide with the Milky Way. I confirmed that Andromeda is on a collision course, projected to occur in about 4.5 billion years. I clarified that this collision will likely be more of a merging process rather than a catastrophic event, as the vast distances between stars mean they will mostly pass by one another. The outcome of this merger is expected to result in a new elliptical galaxy, often referred to as "Milkomeda."
