The section of the report discusses three activities: Recreational Fishing, Sand Borrow Locations, and Artificial Reefs. Recreational fishing involves private boaters and charters, and potential conflicts may arise if wind turbines are installed in commonly fished areas. Sand borrow locations are used for beach replenishment and may conflict with wind energy development. Artificial reefs serve as habitats for fish and are popular fishing spots, but their physical obstructions can conflict with wind turbine placement.
