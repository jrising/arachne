In a report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy, three key resources and activities are discussed: Recreational Fishing, Sand Borrow Locations, and Artificial Reefs. 

Recreational Fishing involves private boaters and fishing charters and may conflict with proposed wind turbine installations. The current status is ongoing with potential space-use conflicts. The spatial extent is not specified, but data was obtained from various sources. The temporal pattern is not mentioned, and potential expansion/changes include conflicts if turbines are installed in commonly fished areas. Stakeholders are recreational fishers, offshore wind developers, and resource managers.

Sand Borrow Locations are used by the USACE for beach replenishment. Specific locations are not provided, but active and potential sites are identified. These sites may conflict with wind development proposals. Stakeholders are the USACE, wind turbine developers, and the Delaware Geological Survey.

Artificial Reefs are installed structures that provide habitat for fish and are popular fishing spots. There are 56 reefs, with 19 within the study area, but specific areas are not given. These reefs might conflict with turbine installations due to physical obstructions. Stakeholders are state Departments of Fish & Wildlife, fishers, and wind developers.

These resources highlight potential conflicts and considerations for the development of offshore wind projects in Delaware's Ocean & Bay Plan.
