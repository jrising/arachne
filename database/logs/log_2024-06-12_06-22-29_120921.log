James inquired about how an organization might track success based on specific metrics related to a grant aimed at improving energy-efficient buildings. I provided an example involving the "Energy Efficiency Hub," outlining key performance indicators such as increased energy efficiency (measured by energy use before and after interventions), reduced energy costs (tracked via tenant energy bills), and the number of community buildings implementing efficiency measures. Additionally, I suggested measuring policy influence and the promotion of best practices as further indicators of success. This discussion highlighted the Hub's goals and potential methods for evaluating its impact on frontline communities.
