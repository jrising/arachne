James sought help regarding his music keyboard not being recognized by his Mac. I provided several troubleshooting steps: checking System Information to see if the keyboard appears under the USB section, testing different USB ports, using an alternative cable, resetting the MIDI configuration in Audio MIDI Setup, reviewing Security & Privacy settings for any blocks, and ensuring macOS and GarageBand are up to date. By following these steps, he could determine whether the issue lies with the connectivity or the cable.
