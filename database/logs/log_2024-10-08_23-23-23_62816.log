James inquired whether sharing a last name with a past ancestor guarantees the same Y-chromosome inheritance. I explained that it is likely if the ancestor is a direct paternal link (father, grandfather, etc.), but mutations over generations can lead to variations. Additionally, non-paternal events could alter Y-chromosome transmission, complicating this assumption. I suggested that genetic testing for Y-chromosome haplogroups could provide more clarity on his paternal lineage.
