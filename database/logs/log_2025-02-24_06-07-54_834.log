The conversation addressed the federal administration's withdrawal of support for the National Building Performance Standards Coalition, essential for advancing environmentally-friendly building policies. The Coalition, which includes 48 jurisdictions and affects 25% of the nationâ€™s commercial building stock, has been supported by the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) since 2022. Despite this setback, the ongoing goal is to sustain momentum in building decarbonization and climate justice. To achieve this, $150,000 of a larger $2.5M+ funding requirement is sought to maintain Coalition infrastructure and member support, ensuring the continuity of impactful initiatives and projects.
