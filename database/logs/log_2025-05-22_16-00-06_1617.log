The discussion began with James inquiring about using `pyppeteer` in Python REPL to fetch a URL. After providing an example of how to use `pyppeteer`, James reported encountering a `net::ERR_ABORTED` error when attempting to run the code. It was identified that the URL led directly to a PDF download rather than a webpage. I suggested using the `requests` library to download the PDF directly instead of using `pyppeteer`. Next, James asked how to obtain the content type of the download, impose a timeout on requests, and limit the download size to 10 MB. I provided code snippets incorporating these requirements. Finally, James wanted to keep the PDF in memory rather than writing it to disk, leading to the use of `io.BytesIO`. The conversation concluded with James encountering a `BufferError`, indicating issues with handling the memory buffer correctly.
