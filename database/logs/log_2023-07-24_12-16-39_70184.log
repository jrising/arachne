The Tolerance parameter in QGIS's distance-based feature simplification tool represents the maximum distance a vertex can be moved during the simplification process. It is specified in the linear unit of the coordinate system being used, although for lat-lon maps, degrees are commonly used. The tolerance value does not directly represent degrees because of the Earth's curved surface. In the previous conversation, James was seeking clarity on the units of the tolerance value and mentioned that a value of 1 resulted in small changes. The response provided information on the typical units used and suggested that if a tolerance value of 1 is making small changes, the map's coordinate system may not be correctly set or the tool is treating the tolerance value as a linear measurement. The suggestion was to ensure the map's coordinate system is correctly set to WGS84 and adjust the tolerance value accordingly.
