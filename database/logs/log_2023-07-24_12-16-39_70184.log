During the conversation, James asked about the Tolerance parameter in QGIS's distance-based feature simplification tool. Arachne explained that the Tolerance parameter represents the maximum distance a vertex can be moved during the simplification process and provided a detailed explanation of how it works. James then asked about the units of the tolerance value, considering a lat-lon map. Arachne clarified that the tolerance value is typically specified in the linear unit of the coordinate system being used and explained that the Earth's curved surface affects the interpretation of degrees. Arachne recommended checking the map's coordinate system and adjusting the tolerance value accordingly.
