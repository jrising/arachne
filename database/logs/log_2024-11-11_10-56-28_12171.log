James is organizing a seminar for two recently tenured faculty members, a physical oceanographer and a marine biologist. He seeks a fun and informative title, receiving several suggestions, ultimately settling on **"Beneath the Surface: Joint Seminar on Current and Future Research."** He aims to enhance the abstract by highlighting the faculty's recent work, specifically incorporating terms starting with "A" or "C." I provided phrases like **"Arctic Seas to Apex Predators"** and **"Climate Change to Conservation,"** helping James create a more engaging narrative around the seminar's themes.
