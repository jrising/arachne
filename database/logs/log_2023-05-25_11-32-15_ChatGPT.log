The discussion focused on understanding the terms "State/Local Government Demand" and "Federal Government Demand" in IMPLAN. It was clarified that these terms refer to the demand created by government entities for goods and services, not their tax incomes. The concept of "Final Demand" in IMPLAN was explained as the demand for goods and services that are not used as inputs in the production of other goods and services. The user also inquired about obtaining tax data at the ZIP code level, to which it was explained that such data is not readily available due to privacy concerns and the complexity of tax data collection. Various potential sources for obtaining tax data at the ZIP code level were suggested, including the IRS, state and local governments, the U.S. Census Bureau, private or third-party sources, and academic or policy research.
