In a previous conversation, James asked about the meaning of "State/Local Government Demand" and "Federal Government Demand" in IMPLAN. The AI explained that these terms refer to the purchases of goods and services made by these levels of government, not their tax income. It clarified that "Final Demand" in IMPLAN refers to the demand for goods and services that are consumed as end products. In a subsequent question, James asked about obtaining tax data at the ZIP code level. The AI explained that direct and comprehensive sources for tax data at this level are not readily available due to privacy concerns and data complexity. It suggested exploring options such as the IRS SOI Program, state and local government revenue departments, the U.S. Census Bureau, private or third-party sources, and academic or policy research. The AI advised James to consider the limitations and caveats of any ZIP code-level tax data obtained.
