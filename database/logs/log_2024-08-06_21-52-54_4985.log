James encountered issues displaying raster tiles in his R Shiny Leaflet app. The problem may stem from incorrect tile numbering or paths not aligning with Leaflet's expectations. To resolve this, I suggested double-checking the tile naming convention and ensuring the tile paths are correctly referenced within the Shiny `www` directory. Debugging tips included monitoring network traffic in the browser's Developer tools and considering filesystem case sensitivity. The provided revised `urlTemplate` code snippet aimed to clarify the path structure for displaying tiles effectively within the Shiny app. Further details on the Shiny directory structure and additional code snippets were requested for targeted assistance if needed.
