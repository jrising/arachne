James asked how to combine two dictionaries in Julia to get the union of their keys. The assistant explained that he can use the `merge()` function to achieve this. It provided an example and clarified that in cases where the same key exists in both dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary will be used. It also mentioned that the order of the resulting dictionary may differ due to the nature of Julia dictionaries.
