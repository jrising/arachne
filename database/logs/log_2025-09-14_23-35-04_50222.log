James received an email from Donald Ugochukwu Chukwumaeze, a prospective PhD applicant interested in research on climate change and fishery productivity. Donald expressed admiration for James's work presented in a 2024 paper and inquired about mentorship opportunities while preparing his application for Fall 2026. James requested a concise, professional email response and decided to inform Donald that he is not accepting new students this year. The drafted email acknowledged Donald's research interests and encouraged him to pursue other faculty while providing a link for a potential Zoom chat to discuss his research further.
