James inquired about how to create a raster stack in R consisting of multiple raster objects that represent yields for different years, specifically how to label these layers by year. I provided a detailed step-by-step guide using the `raster` package, which included loading the library, creating a list of raster objects, assigning names corresponding to each year, and finally using the `stack()` function to create the raster stack. I also suggested verifying the stack through plotting or inspection to ensure correctness.
