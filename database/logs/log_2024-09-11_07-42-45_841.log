James sought to strengthen a statement regarding the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) and its impactful climate initiatives, particularly through Building Performance Standards (BPS). I provided a revised version emphasizing IMT as a national leader actively combating climate change by improving building energy performance. I highlighted IMT's strategic opportunity to enhance its impact by supporting policymakers utilizing federal resources. Additionally, I detailed the Building Innovation Hub ("The Hub") in Washington, D.C., under IMT's purview, outlining its services such as vendor matchmaking, policy guidance, outreach on compliance deadlines, green career pathways, and support for under-resourced buildings lacking BEPS adequacy.
