James shared a language design consisting of the letters N, I, and O, with derived letters representing different concepts. He requested a word for "research" in this language. The assistant proposed "RON" or "RO-N" as suitable options, highlighting that "R" represents knowledge, "O" denotes change (as a verb), and "N" signifies existence (as a noun). This choice aligns with the meaning of "research" as the process of gaining knowledge through investigation.
