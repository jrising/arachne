James Rising sought to set up a survey for prospective marine policy students at UD, looking for features like conditional question progression, file uploads, and automated email notifications upon completion. I suggested using platforms like Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, SurveyMonkey, or Typeform. I highlighted that both Google and Microsoft would be free options and advised on selecting between them based on user familiarity, features, and integration capabilities. James later asked how to implement the "go to section based on answer" feature in Google Forms, and I provided a detailed step-by-step guide on creating sections, enabling navigation based on answers, and sharing the survey effectively.
