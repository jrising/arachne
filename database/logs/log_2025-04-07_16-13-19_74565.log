James Rising received an email from MD. Jahin Khandakar expressing interest in a PhD opportunity focused on climate change and social-environmental systems modeling. Jahin outlined his qualifications, including an MS and B.Sc. in Oceanography, and emphasized his relevant research experience. In response, James acknowledged Jahin's background and expressed regret that no funding for new PhD students was available this year. He offered an opportunity for a preliminary Zoom discussion about potential opportunities in the future, inviting Jahin to schedule a meeting.
