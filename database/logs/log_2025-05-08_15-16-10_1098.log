James asked about the location of the Lake of the Lady of the Lake from the King Arthur legends. I explained that it is a mythical location linked to the Lady of the Lake, who is crucial in the lore for giving King Arthur his sword Excalibur and taking him to Avalon. The lake doesn't have a specific real-world location; instead, it exists within the mythological landscape of Arthurian tales, with various interpretations placing it across Britain. I also suggested that James might enjoy exploring the legends through literary works, specifically recommending Sir Thomas Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur."
