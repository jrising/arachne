James asked if it is possible to feed words dynamically to the JavaScript `SpeechSynthesis` API or if the whole text needs to be available at the beginning. Arachne explained that the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object needs to be configured with the complete text before it starts speaking, so dynamic word feeding is not possible. However, Arachne suggested a workaround by creating small utterances in sequences and triggering the next utterance once the previous one is completed. Arachne provided a code example demonstrating how to achieve this illusion of feeding words incrementally.
