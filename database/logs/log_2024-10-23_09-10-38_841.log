In a discussion, James requested a membership model and partnership proposal for Turner Construction, aiming to integrate resources from the DC Building Innovation Hub, the Building Energy Exchange (NYC), the CEO Energy Policy Database, and consulting hours from the Green Lease Leaders Program. I proposed two tailored packages: the first, a Sustainable Construction Partnership for $50,000, which included memberships to both hubs, consulting hours, and database access, and the second, a more focused Sustainable Building Innovation Collaboration for $25,000, with specified allocations. Each proposal highlighted benefits such as networking opportunities, access to research, energy policy information, and tailored consulting to enhance sustainability initiatives in both markets.
