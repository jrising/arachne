James asked for the variance of a model where Y = alpha + beta A + gamma T. Arachne provided a detailed explanation, calculating Var(Y) as beta^2 * Var(A) + gamma^2 * Var(T) + 2*beta*gamma*Cov(A,T). Arachne highlighted the variances of constants, rules for calculating variances of constants multiplied by variables, and the covariance term. She noted the absence of an error term in the equation and the assumption that A and T are random variables.
