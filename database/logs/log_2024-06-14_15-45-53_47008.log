James requested social media posts and website content formats to promote his new publication on climate econometrics, focusing on key decision points in weather and climate data analysis. I provided him with a tweet, LinkedIn post, HTML block for his lab website, and an article for his professional blog summarizing the tutorial's content, purpose, and audience. The promotional materials highlighted the practical guidance, step-by-step approach, and reusable code snippets in multiple programming languages available in the tutorial. I emphasized the tutorial's role in addressing knowledge gaps, supporting researchers in climate econometrics, and its free, open-source nature. James was encouraged to promote the tutorial online to reach a wider audience interested in climate data analysis and econometrics.
