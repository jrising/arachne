In a previous conversation, James asked if it is possible to calculate the quantiles for a mixture distribution when only the quantiles for each individual distribution are known. The AI assistant explained that it is not straightforward to mathematically merge quantiles from different distributions to obtain the quantiles for the mixture distribution. However, it suggested using a Monte Carlo simulation approach to approximate the quantiles of the mixture distribution. This method involves generating random draws from each original distribution, assigning them to their respective source distribution, randomly selecting draws from each distribution, and determining the desired quantiles from the newly created set of data. The assistant also noted that this method can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, especially with larger N and higher required accuracy for the results.
