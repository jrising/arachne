Several researchers and groups at MIT are working on the socioeconomic risks of climate change, such as the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, and the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. These organizations conduct research on the economic and policy aspects of climate change and develop technological and policy solutions to mitigate its impacts. They have collaborated on the MIT Climate Portal, which provides the latest research on climate change and its socioeconomic impacts.
