MIT has several researchers and groups actively working on the socioeconomic risks of climate change. The Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, and the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research are key contributors in this field. These initiatives focus on understanding the economic and policy aspects of climate change and developing technological and policy solutions to mitigate its impacts. These groups have collaborated on the MIT Climate Portal, which serves as a platform for sharing the latest research on climate change and its socioeconomic impacts. MIT's interdisciplinary approach in addressing climate change highlights its commitment to finding comprehensive solutions to this global challenge.
