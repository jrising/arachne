James asked how to run Python scripts from another Python script using the command `python <scriptname>`, while capturing the output. I recommended using the `subprocess` module, specifically the `subprocess.run()` function, to accomplish this. I provided an example function, `run_script`, that executes the specified script, captures its output, and handles errors with `try` and `except`. Key points included capturing both `stdout` and `stderr`, processing output as text, and raising an error for non-zero return codes. This approach allows for flexibility and error management when executing scripts.
