James asked if $1 in 2011 dollars represents more or less than $1 in 2021 dollars. I explained that due to inflation, the value of $1 in 2011 dollars would generally be less than $1 in 2021 dollars. To find out the exact rate of inflation, James was recommended to refer to inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or use an online inflation calculator.
