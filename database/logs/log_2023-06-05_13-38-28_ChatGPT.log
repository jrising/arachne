This paper explores the social cost of carbon (SCC) and the potential impact of structural changes on SCC estimates. Analyzing 147 studies published between 2000 and 2020, the authors isolate the effects of nine structural changes, six preference parameters, and 14 dimensions of uncertainty on SCC. They find that while the distribution of published SCCs and experts' estimates have diverged from the formal US SCC estimate, structural changes such as persistent damages to economic output, limited substitutability of ecosystem services, and changes to Earth system processes have the greatest effects on SCC. The authors also calibrate a Random Forest model of SCC values and construct a Synthetic SCC estimate based on expert assessments of the structural changes, finding a significantly larger mean Synthetic SCC estimate compared to the current formal US SCC estimate. The paper aims to shed light on the hidden and underestimated social costs of carbon.
