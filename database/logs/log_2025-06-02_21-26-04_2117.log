James asked how to save all the `stdout` produced by a function to a file in Python. I suggested using `contextlib.redirect_stdout` for this purpose. I provided a code snippet demonstrating how to define a function, open a file in write mode, and redirect output to that file. The output generated by the function would then be written to `output.txt`, effectively capturing everything that would normally appear in the console.
