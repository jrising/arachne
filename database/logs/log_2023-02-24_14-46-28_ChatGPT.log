The discussion focused on projects and academic papers that attempt to assess climate risks and calculate total welfare losses across all impacts. Various examples were provided, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, the Global Risk Report, the Climate Risk Assessment and Management (CRAM) project, the Climate Impact Lab, the Global Adaptation Index (GAIN), and the Climate Risk Index. The conversation also explored the estimation of damage functions in models like DICE and academic papers that inform these functions. Lastly, there was a discussion on academic papers that estimate the total welfare loss from climate change, with an emphasis on comprehensiveness, as well as the question of missing risks from climate change.
