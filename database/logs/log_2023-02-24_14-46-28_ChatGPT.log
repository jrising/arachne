This discussion focused on projects and academic papers that have attempted to assess climate risks and calculate total welfare losses across all impacts. Several projects were mentioned, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, the Global Risk Report, and the Climate Risk Assessment and Management (CRAM) project. Academic papers such as those from the Climate Impact Lab and the Global Adaptation Index (GAIN) were highlighted as examples of estimating total welfare losses. Expert elicitation was also mentioned, with papers like Hope et al. (2015) and Howard et al. (2017) using this technique. The estimation of damage functions in models like DICE was discussed, citing steps such as identifying relevant economic sectors and gathering historical impact data. Finally, the papers by Nordhaus (1991) and Mendelsohn et al. (2000) were mentioned as influential in informing the damage function in DICE. The conclusion highlighted academic papers that attempt to estimate comprehensive welfare losses and address the concept of missing risks from climate change.
