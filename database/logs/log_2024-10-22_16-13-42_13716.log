James described a recurring issue with his toilet where it keeps running. He usually resolves this by reseating the flapper but noted his wife's lack of interest in learning the fix. After visiting Home Depot and finding limited parts, I advised on inspecting and cleaning the flapper, checking the chain adjustment, and considering a replacement. When James clarified that the hinge of his flapper pops off the bar, raising concerns about future replacements, I suggested examining the hinge for wear, ensuring proper alignment, and choosing a reinforced flapper. I emphasized the importance of a proper part size, recommending he measure the flush valve and consider durable options or self-adjusting models for better performance.
