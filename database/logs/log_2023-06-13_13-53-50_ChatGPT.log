Environmental health refers to the study and management of factors in the environment that can potentially affect human health. It includes topics such as air and water quality, food safety, waste management, and the impact of climate change on health. The goal of environmental health is to prevent disease and create health-supportive environments. The field is crucial because a significant portion of global disease burden is attributed to environmental factors. Environmental health professionals work in public health departments, regulatory agencies, and private firms, collaborating with stakeholders to implement strategies for healthier environments and populations.
