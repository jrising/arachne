In a conversation with James, he asked about a childhood book with a tape about a boy lost in a dinosaur-themed amusement park. Initially, the assistant suggested it might be from the "Choose Your Own Adventure" series, specifically the book "Escape" by R.A. Montgomery. However, James clarified that it was not a choose your own adventure book. The assistant then requested additional details from James to assist in identifying the book.
