James sought guidance on creating a system in Python that utilizes search engine snippets to answer questions. I advised him to use a search API, such as the Bing or Google Custom Search Engine, instead of scraping directly. The process included steps like obtaining API access, querying the API, and parsing results. I provided an example implementation for the Google Custom Search API with Python code and suggested using NLP libraries for further synthesis of information. Additionally, I highlighted the importance of handling errors and adhering to API usage limits and terms of service.
