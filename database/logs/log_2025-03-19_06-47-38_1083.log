In a discussion on investment returns in sustainable sectors, James shared insights regarding various components, including health and disaster finance, sustainable agriculture, and infrastructure projects. The conversation highlighted that health-related investments yield the highest returns, followed closely by sustainable agriculture and forestry, which benefit from climate mitigation and induced development. Infrastructure projects have moderate returns, but urban adaptation often neglects to value avoided losses. Water projects are noted for their lower IRRs due to inadequate benefits valuation despite their adaptation importance. The conversation pointed out that many adaptation projects fail to quantify avoided losses, which hinders their assessment. Reasons for this include valuation challenges and the high IRRs of adaptation projects, which can be achieved without considering avoided losses. The comparison between water's role in adaptation and energy's role in mitigation was also emphasized.
