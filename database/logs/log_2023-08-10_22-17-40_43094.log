The email conversation discussed the request for specific data sets related to fisheries. "Footprint data" refers to spatial information on the distribution and intensity of fishing activities, while "VMS raster data" refers to data obtained from Vessel Monitoring Systems and represents the specific locations and movements of fishing vessels. Footprint data is often presented as a grid or raster, with each cell representing a specific geographic area and containing information about fishing effort. It can be analyzed at different levels of specificity, such as by species or by port. While VMS data provides information on the location and movement of fishing vessels, it may not include vessel-level details such as fishing equipment or tonnage capacity. Such details are typically gathered through other sources. The conversation highlighted the need for specific parameters when requesting data and outlined the different data sources and offices responsible for providing the requested information.
