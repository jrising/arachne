In this conversation, James is seeking clarification on the terms "footprint data" and "VMS raster data" in the context of fisheries. "Footprint data" refers to spatial information on the distribution and intensity of fishing activities, while "VMS raster data" specifically refers to data obtained from Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and represents the specific locations and movements of fishing vessels. Footprint data is typically presented as a grid or raster, while VMS raster data is a more detailed representation of vessel presence or activity. Footprint data can be analyzed at different levels of specificity, including by species and by port. VMS data provides information about the location and movement of fishing vessels but may not include vessel-level details such as fishing equipment or tonnage capacity.
