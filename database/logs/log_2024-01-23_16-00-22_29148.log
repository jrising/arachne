In a conversation with James, he asked about the most important vitamin deficiency that a population reliant on fish consumption but losing that source would expect. Arachne explained that a population relying on fish as a primary food source and losing that source could experience deficiencies in vitamin D and Omega-3 fatty acids, which are crucial for bone health and brain function, respectively. Arachne also mentioned potential deficiencies in iodine, vitamin B12, and selenium, but their prevalence would depend on the remaining dietary habits. She emphasized the importance of finding suitable alternatives and considering fortified products or supplements to mitigate nutrient deficiencies. The recommendations would need to be tailored to the specific needs and resources of the population.
