In a previous discussion, James requested assistance to draft a professional email response to Mr. Coumba Ndoff√®ne DIOUF, who expressed interest in pursuing a PhD in "Sustainable Fisheries Management." The email needed to acknowledge Mr. Diouf's experience and support while clarifying that all funding for 2025 admissions has been exhausted due to changes in the US, which presents a significant constraint. The response emphasized the importance of exploring various funding opportunities and offered to discuss further via a Zoom chat. A scheduling link was included for convenience. The tone was intended to be professional, dispassionate, and to-the-point.
