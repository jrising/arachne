James is writing a story set in Salem, MA in 1657, where his ancestor, also named James, meets Elizabeth, who is unknowingly a witch. He seeks to portray Elizabeth as an independent-minded woman during their initial encounter, incorporating a rom-com misunderstanding. I suggested a scene where James, weary from his journey, encounters Elizabeth in a marketplace, impressed by her assertive haggling with a vendor. A stray cat knocks over apples, leading James to offer assistance, mistakenly believing they belong to her. Elizabeth humorously corrects him, remarking on the situationâ€™s theatricality, showcasing her charm and wit. This interaction highlights Elizabeth's independence and sets the stage for their evolving relationship, infused with mystery.
