James encountered a discrepancy while running ANOVA on a linear model in R, expecting the Sum Sq column to align with the sum of squares of the dependent variable. He realized this could be influenced by interaction effects but later determined his model had no interactions. I explained that in a simple linear model with one predictor variable, the total sum of squares should equal the sum of squares explained by the predictor and the residuals. I suggested direct calculations to verify that the discrepancy wasn't due to Type I sums of squares or computational precision issues in the ANOVA output.
