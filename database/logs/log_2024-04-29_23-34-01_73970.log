James sought advice for a 2-day camping trip to Hickory Run State Park with his 3-year-old son. I provided a comprehensive plan, including a packing list (tent, sleeping bags, clothing layers), meal ideas (pasta salad, pancakes, PB&J sandwiches), and activities (nature walk, scavenger hunt, stargazing). The suggestions aimed to ensure comfort, safety, and enjoyable experiences for James and his son during their camping adventure.
