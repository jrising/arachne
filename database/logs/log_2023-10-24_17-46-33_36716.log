Lingze Meng, a Chinese graduate student with a background in marine chemistry, reached out to Dr. James Rising expressing interest in the Marine Policy Ph.D. program at the School of Marine Science & Policy at the University of Delaware. Initially, the assistant suggested that Lingze consider the Ph.D. program in Environmental Economics. However, upon recognition of the oversight, the assistant apologized and acknowledged that the Marine Policy Ph.D. program would indeed be a better fit. The assistant advised Lingze to directly contact the School of Marine Science & Policy to inquire about potential Ph.D. candidate positions under Dr. James Rising's supervision and funding opportunities. Lingze was encouraged to highlight their research experience in marine chemistry, programming and mathematical modeling skills, and their passion for marine policy and governance in their communication with the program.
