In the previous conversation, James asked how to remove minor grid lines from ggplot. Arachne provided a solution using the `theme()` function in ggplot2. Arachne explained that the `panel.grid.minor` element can be set to `element_blank()` to remove the minor grid lines. She provided an example code snippet showing how to create a plot with minor grid lines and how to remove them by changing the `panel.grid.minor` element. Arachne's solution involved using the `theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line())` argument to create the minor grid lines and then adding `theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())` to remove them. The `element_blank()` function effectively sets the `panel.grid.minor` element to be blank, thus removing the minor grid lines from the plot.
