James sought to update the label of a select box in a Shiny app dynamically while also adding new options without affecting existing ones. After initial attempts with direct JavaScript manipulation, he faced challenges due to Shiny's use of `selectize.js` for select inputs. The solution involved accessing the `selectize` instance to add new options and refresh the display correctly. The revised approach provided a seamless experience for users to update the select box label and add new options, ensuring compatibility with Shiny's dynamic UI components and maintaining the integrity of existing choices.
