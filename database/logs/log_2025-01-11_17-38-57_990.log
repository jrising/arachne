James inquired about a peculiar shield featuring a man's face with a beard and mustache, distinct from typical Gorgon imagery. Arachne first suggested it might be a Gorgon shield with a Gorgoneion, but James clarified that it wasn't Gorgon-related. Arachne then proposed it could be the "Omphalos" or "Aegis," but James pointed out that those symbols typically included Medusa. The conversation concluded with Arachne identifying it as the "Gorgoneion of Achaia," a protective symbol often depicted with a male face and tongue. This lesser-known emblem was believed to ward off evil and reflected the diversity of ancient Greek mythology and art.
