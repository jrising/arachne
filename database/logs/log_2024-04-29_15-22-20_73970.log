James inquired about self-enforcing contracts in contract theory, prompting a discussion on Coasean contracts as self-enforcing agreements. The Coase theorem underpins these contracts, highlighting how parties naturally negotiate optimal agreements to mutual benefit. A hypothetical scenario involving a polluting factory and a fishing business illustrated the self-enforcing nature of Coasean contracts. While real-world contracts face transaction costs and information asymmetry, elements of self-enforcement are present, like in performance-based contracts.
