James is experiencing an error ("Incomplete response received from application") when running his Flask app on a remote server with Passenger. The error indicates that the app didn't close the connection or send a complete response. The underlying issue may be due to differences in how Passenger and Flask handle responses, particularly for streamed responses. Two potential areas to explore are the timeout settings in Passenger, which may need to be increased, and the suitability of Passenger for handling long-lived connections or streaming responses. It is suggested to check the Passenger documentation for configuration options and consider using a different WSGI server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI. Inspecting server logs and stress testing the new settings is recommended.
