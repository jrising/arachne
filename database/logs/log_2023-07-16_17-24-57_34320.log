James was experiencing an "Incomplete response received from application" error when running his Flask app on a remote server under Passenger. The assistant suggested two potential causes: timeout settings and streaming responses. Passenger has a default timeout of 30 seconds, so increasing the timeout value might resolve the issue. Additionally, Passenger may not handle long-lived connections or streaming responses well, so using a different WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI could be more effective. The assistant recommended inspecting server logs for additional insight and stress testing the new settings to ensure optimal performance and resource alignment.
