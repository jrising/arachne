James sought to write a Python function that identifies a specific level of sections and subsystems in a Markdown file, returning contained subsections and their unique identifiers or text. I recommended using the `Markdown-it-py` library to parse Markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). I provided a sample implementation that includes installing the library, parsing the content into an AST, and traversing the tree to gather sections and their identifiers based on their heading levels. The function retrieves sections matching a specified level, showing how to manage Markdown content effectively.
