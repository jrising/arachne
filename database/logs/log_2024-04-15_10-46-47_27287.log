James sought guidance on the strengths and weaknesses of Global Sensitivity Analysis methods, specifically the Delta Moment-Independent, EASI, and Regression methods. When considering the correlation between input variables, he initially inquired about the Delta Method's suitability. However, the assistant advised against it due to the method's assumption of independent inputs. Subsequently, clarification was provided that the EASI Method can handle correlated inputs effectively, despite earlier misconceptions. James was encouraged to consider the EASI Method for his scenario, given its ability to address input interdependencies in sensitivity analysis.
