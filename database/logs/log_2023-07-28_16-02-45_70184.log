James has two implementations of a dot product, one for AVX and one for SSE, with the only difference being the VECTOR_SIZE constant. Arachne explains that VECTOR_SIZE defines the width of the vectors the code operates on and suggests combining the code and dynamically defining VECTOR_SIZE based on system support. Arachne provides a code sample using preprocessor macros and advises adapting the computation code accordingly. Arachne also suggests considering libraries or auto-vectorizers for complex computations and warns of the need to verify system support before using AVX/SSE operations.
