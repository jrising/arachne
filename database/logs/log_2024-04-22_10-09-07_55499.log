James asked about the singular and plural forms of "curriculum vitae," learning that the singular is "curriculum vitae" and the plural is "curricula vitae." The assistant explained the Latin origins and the translation of the term. The discussion clarified that while the plural form is correct, it is not commonly used in everyday language, where "resumes" or "CVs" are more frequently used.
