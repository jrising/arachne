In a previous conversation, James asked about the sailing capabilities of a 3-mast ship like the whaler Essex. Arachne explained that such ships could sail approximately 60 to 70 degrees off the wind, known as "close-hauled," meaning they could not sail directly into the wind but had to move in a zigzag pattern called "tacking" or "beating to windward." Arachne also noted that the ship's ability to sail into the wind depended on factors such as sail conditions, ship load, sea state, and the quality of the ship's rigging and design.
