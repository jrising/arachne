In a previous conversation, James asked if cross-validation was used to fit ChatGPT. Cross-validation was not used in training the model, as it is typically employed in machine learning tasks to evaluate model performance. Instead, OpenAI utilized a method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Initially, human AI trainers generated responses to conversational prompts, creating a dataset from which the model learned through reinforcement learning. To further improve the model, comparison data was collected where AI trainers ranked different model responses. Proximal Policy Optimization was then used to fine-tune the model. Although cross-validation was not used, this comprehensive approach helped train ChatGPT to be more responsive and aligned with human values.
