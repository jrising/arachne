James inquired about the terms "CTD" and "ZEE" from his colleague's proposed data sharing involving marine research in Senegal. Arachne clarified that CTD stands for Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth, used in marine surveys to gather sea characteristics. ZEE refers to Exclusive Economic Zone, granting a state special rights over marine resources. The data shared includes surveys and CTD data from Senegal's EEZ over 30 years, plus historical and projected fish stock information until 2050, crucial for assessing marine ecosystem health and sustainable fisheries management.
