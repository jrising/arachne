James inquired about determining an internal rate of return (IRR) for a stream of costs and benefits. I explained that IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of cash flows equal to zero. The process involves identifying cash flows, setting up the NPV equation, and solving for IRR using iterative methods such as trial and error or financial software. I provided a detailed NPV equation and suggested using Excelâ€™s built-in IRR function for convenience. I also noted that while IRR is a valuable metric, it should be evaluated alongside other factors for informed decision-making, as it assumes interim cash flows are reinvested at the same rate.
