The discussion focused on merging two reviews of the TransformAr grant project. Both reviews highlighted the project's achievements in developing adaptive solutions for vulnerable European regions and improving stakeholder engagement practices. The project successfully demonstrated 21 actionable solutions, including climate resilience innovations and nature-based strategies. However, concerns were raised about the disconnect between work packages, specifically between WP2 and others that would benefit from its outputs, along with inadequate information flow from WP4 and WP5 to WP6. Overall, substantial progress was noted in meeting project objectives, although some deliverables require revisions and the scientific quality varied. Communication efforts were effective, yet most scientific publications are still pending.
