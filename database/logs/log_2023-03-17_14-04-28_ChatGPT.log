In this conversation, James and I discussed the difference between Make and Use IO matrices, as well as Domestic Use matrices. I explained that Make IO matrices show the inputs required by each industry to produce its output, while Use IO matrices show the final uses of goods and services produced in an economy. We also talked about the Leontief inverse matrix, which represents the total requirements of each industry's output to produce a unit of final demand, taking into account both direct and indirect effects. I provided insights into the rows and columns of a Make matrix, the meaning of "Used" and "Other" columns, and how to interpret entries in a Leontief matrix. Lastly, I shared information on retrieving sector lists from the stateior package in R and explained how to combine the Leontief matrix with vectors of final production or supply to determine the production across sectors.
