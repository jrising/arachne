James requested to navigate to the "next page," prompting me to clarify the context of his request. I noted that the original prompt was nonspecific and indicated the necessity for more details about the application or document he was working with. I suggested options like PDF, Word, Google Docs, or a slideshow, in order to provide precise guidance for his navigation needs. This conversation emphasized the importance of context in addressing queries effectively.
