In this conversation, James asked the AI assistant for a tutorial on running the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). The assistant provided a link to the official GTAP website, which offers a user manual, training courses, tutorials, research papers, and discussion forums. James then inquired about running GTAP on a Mac, to which the assistant confirmed that GTAP is platform-independent and can be run on macOS by installing the GAMS software. Finally, James raised a question about the relationship between GTAP, GAMS, and GEMPACK. The assistant explained that GAMS is a general-purpose modeling system, while GEMPACK is a specialized software system designed for solving large-scale economic models like GTAP. The GTAP model is implemented in GEMPACK, and users need to obtain and install the GEMPACK software from the official GEMPACK website to run GTAP effectively.
