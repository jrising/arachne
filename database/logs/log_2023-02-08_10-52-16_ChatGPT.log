James asked for a tutorial on running GTAP, and the assistant directed him to the official GTAP website, which has a user manual, training courses, tutorials, and research papers. James then asked if GTAP can be run on a Mac, and the assistant confirmed that it can, as GTAP is platform-independent and can be run on any operating system. The assistant also mentioned that GTAP uses GEMPACK software, not GAMS. James inquired about the relationship between GEMPACK and GAMS, and the assistant explained that GAMS is a general-purpose modeling system, while GEMPACK is a specialized software system specifically designed for solving large-scale general equilibrium models like GTAP.
