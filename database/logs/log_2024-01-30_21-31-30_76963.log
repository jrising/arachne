According to a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018), there are critical data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process, particularly in fisheries management. The report highlights the need for better understanding of fishing productivity, identification of active and economically important fishing areas, forecasting commercial fishing trends, and development of effective management strategies. These gaps also affect the management of protected species, fishing quotas, allocation conflicts, landing locations, and proposed projects. The report emphasizes the importance of comprehensive stakeholder engagement in the fishing industry for accurate planning and conflict resolution. These data gaps hinder sustainable and efficient planning, and future work should explore new data collection methods or collaborations to address these gaps and improve ocean and bay planning in Delaware.
