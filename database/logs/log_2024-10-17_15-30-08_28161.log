James Rising received an email from Prince Apalazoea, a prospective graduate student who deferred his admission to Fall 2025 to seek funding for his Environmental Science and Management program. He requested assistance with available resources or recommendations. In response, James provided a professional and clear email draft, informing Prince about a recent University of Delaware policy change that removed funding opportunities for ESM Master's students. He expressed empathy for Prince's situation and offered to help explore alternative funding sources, suggesting a Zoom meeting for further discussion and providing a scheduling link.
