James asked for guidance on building a Python system to track updates/news about contacts across multiple networks. I provided a step-by-step approach, including defining requirements, setting up project structure, managing contacts, fetching updates from APIs, automating searches, storing data, sending notifications, and integrating everything. I recommended using tools like `tweepy`, `newsapi-python`, `googlesearch`, and SQLite. The final `main.py` script combined these components to fetch updates and notify James via email. I emphasized extending the system with more networks, error handling, and customization while respecting API terms of service.
