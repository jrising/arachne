In a previous conversation, James asked how to create a menu that loads dynamically with AJAX using jQuery on his website. Arachne provided step-by-step guidance, including attaching hover events to menu items, using AJAX to fetch submenu content, and injecting the content into the existing menu structure. James then asked about a jQuery menu library that allows for adding items dynamically. Arachne suggested several libraries, including jQuery UI Menu, SmartMenus, MetisMenu, and Superfish, each with its own features and customization options. Finally, James inquired about adding new items to a jQuery UI Menu. Arachne explained that using the `menu("refresh")` method along with the `menu("option", "items")` option allows for dynamically adding new items to the menu, providing an example code snippet.
