James inquired about the importance of having a fundraising strategy. I emphasized that such a strategy is essential for setting clear goals, planning and prioritizing activities, measuring success and progress, managing donor relationships, ensuring sustainability, and aligning team efforts. I highlighted that a fundraising strategy acts as a comprehensive approach to maintaining financial health and effectively engaging with donors, contrasting it with the challenges faced without a clear plan.
