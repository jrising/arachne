In our discussion, James asked me to shorten a passage about climate solutions, emphasizing essential characteristics like accountability, authenticity, and adaptability. I highlighted two key initiatives at IMT: 1) Research on equitable climate action funding in Minnesota through utility interventions and pollution registration, and 2) The Community Climate Shift initiative, which enhances place-based solutions. I mentioned a recent meeting in San Francisco with collaborators, where we shared progress on various projects and discussed effective community engagement strategies. The overall message was a call for collaboration on solutions that align with our values.
