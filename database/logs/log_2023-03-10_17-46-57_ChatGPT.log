To resample an xarray by taking every 10th value along a dimension, the assistant suggests using the `.isel()` method in xarray. The example code provided demonstrates how to resample by taking every 10th value along the time dimension. By loading a sample netCDF dataset and using the `.isel()` method with the argument `slice(None, None, 10)`, all values along the first two dimensions are selected, and every 10th value along the time dimension is chosen. The resampled dataset is then printed using `print(ds_resampled)`.
