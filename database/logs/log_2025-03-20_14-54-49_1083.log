In a previous discussion, James inquired about the origins of the name "Friday," leading to the explanation that it is derived from the Norse goddess Frigg (or Frigga), associated with love, marriage, and fertility. The term "Frīgedæg" translates to "Frigg's day," linking her to Venus in Roman culture. James then requested a history of Frigg, prompting an overview of her significance in Norse mythology. Key points included her marriage to Odin, her role as the mother of Baldr, her attributes of wisdom and nurturing, and her ongoing influence in modern culture and neo-Pagan traditions. Frigg's legacy highlights themes of power, motherhood, and the complexities of fate.
