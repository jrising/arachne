In a discussion about the roles of ministries of finance, central banks, and central finance agencies, we explored their distinct functions. Ministries of finance handle government fiscal policies, budgeting, and taxation, while central banks focus on monetary policy and financial regulation. The term "central finance agencies" may refer to similar institutions but varies by country. Additionally, we discussed the specific levers ministries of finance can manage, such as tax policy adjustments, government spending allocations, public debt management, and fiscal policies. These tools enable ministries to influence economic growth and stability, distinguishing their functions from those of central banks, which directly manage interest rates.
