The interviewee, the mayor of Fenwick, Delaware, discusses the historical and present challenges of coastal flooding in the town, focusing on impacts primarily on the bayside community due to tidal surges and rain. Concerns include safe access to homes, with a dual dune system proving effective on the ocean side. The town has seen increased flooding events, including sunny day events, requiring ongoing adaptation and building elevation. Recent developments show newer, raised homes on the bayside compared to older, potentially at-risk cottages. Adaptation efforts involve maintaining dunes, monitoring for breaches during hurricanes, and managing weekly flooding from nor'easters.
