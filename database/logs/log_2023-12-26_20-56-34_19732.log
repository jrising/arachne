James asked about the appropriate number of samples for computing an Anderson-Darling test. Arachne explained that using a smaller number of samples (around 1000 to 10,000) is common practice. A sensitivity analysis can help determine the optimal number of samples for accurate and stable results. James then asked about the meaning of "k" and "X-sample" in the Anderson-Darling test. Arachne clarified that "k" represents the number of distributions being compared, while "X-sample" refers to the number of samples per distribution. Finally, James inquired about which version of the Anderson-Darling statistic to use. Arachne explained that both the AD-statistic and AD-STAR-statistic are computed by default in the `ad.test` function, with the AD-STAR statistic being more powerful in detecting deviations in the tails of the distribution. Using both versions is recommended for a comprehensive analysis.
