James asked if he could call a function multiple times in Julia, with some arguments remaining the same and only the first few changing. Arachne explained that this can be achieved using partial application or currying, which involves creating a new function that takes the changing arguments and passes them along with the fixed arguments to the original function. Arachne provided a code example to demonstrate how to implement partial application in Julia. The method works as long as the fixed arguments are in the last positions and the changing ones are in the first positions. If the situation is more complex, a custom solution or restructuring of the original function may be required.
