James wants assistance in editing a grant proposal titled "Laboratory for a Just Green Transition". The proposal focuses on addressing the disruptive nature of the clean energy transition and the need to balance the imperative of limiting global warming and fostering green technology with social justice considerations. James also seeks edits to sentences discussing the need to ensure all individuals feel included in the low-carbon future and the importance of acquiring better knowledge about policies and mechanisms for a successful transition. The proposal outlines the establishment of a university-wide research laboratory that will collaborate with existing institutions and conduct assessments of sectoral shifts, job displacements, and skill needs. The laboratory aims to bridge the gap between energy planning and policy-making, generate data and models, and serve as a respected authority for policy-guided research. The proposal also emphasizes the integrated plan for a just transition, engendering broader political support and empowering decision-making in educational offerings.
