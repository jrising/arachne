Peal Ahamed Shanto expressed his strong interest in joining the Department of Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware, despite previous rejections due to funding constraints. James Rising acknowledged Peal's competitive application but indicated that funding limitations prevented admitting him and others. Rising offered to keep Peal's information in the applicant pool for future opportunities and suggested the possibility of reapplying if funding became available. In subsequent communications, Peal sought updates regarding admission, and Rising confirmed that last year only two students were admitted, none to his lab, and that he is waiting on grant responses. Rising encouraged further discussion via Zoom to explore Peal's situation.
