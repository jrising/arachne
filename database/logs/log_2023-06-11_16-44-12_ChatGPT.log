Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and Baby Bear share their favorite porridge recipe, the "Three Bears' Special Forest Berry Porridge." The porridge is made with oats, water, salt, honey, almond milk, mixed forest berries, and optionally, cinnamon. Papa Bear boils the oats, Mama Bear simmers them, and Baby Bear washes the berries. The cooked oats are sweetened with honey and almond milk, and then the berries are added. A sprinkle of cinnamon can be added for extra flavor. The porridge should be allowed to cool a bit before eating. The bears remind us to check for wandering Goldilocks and to share the recipe with loved ones. The result is porridge that's not too hot, not too cold, but just right!
