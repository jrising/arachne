James inquired about the capabilities of WebKit's speech recognition API, specifically whether known phrases could be specified while still allowing for free-form user input. I explained that, while there isn't built-in support for this exact functionality, he can achieve a similar effect by using grammars alongside custom logic. I outlined a general approach that involves initializing the speech recognition, capturing recognized text, comparing it with predefined phrases, and handling free-form input separately. I provided an illustrative JavaScript code example demonstrating how to implement this dual functionality, ensuring an interactive user experience that prioritizes known phrases while accommodating general speech input.
