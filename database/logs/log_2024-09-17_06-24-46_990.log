James requested a scope of work for Hailey to support the Business Engagement Team with pipeline research for the Green Lease Leaders and CEO programs, as well as tracking down contact details for holiday card mailings. My response outlined her key responsibilities, including pipeline research, contact detail acquisition, maintaining Salesforce records, and event tracking for two upcoming in-person events in October (DC) and November (Greenbuild). I detailed expected deliverables, time allocation (40% research, 20% data updating, 20% mailing, 20% event tracking), and a reporting structure for evaluation based on her performance and completion of tasks. This structure provides flexibility to adapt as project requirements evolve.
