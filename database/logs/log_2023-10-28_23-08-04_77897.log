In a previous conversation, James asked how to create a checkbox in LaTeX for an exam. Arachne provided two options using the `amssymb` package. The first option used the `\Box` command to create an empty checkbox, and the second option used the `\CheckedBox` command to create a filled checkbox. Arachne explained that while the checkboxes cannot be checked interactively in the PDF, they are suitable for printed documents.
