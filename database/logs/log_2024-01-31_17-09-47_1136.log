This digest includes selected log entries of past conversations with James. It covers various topics such as data visualization in ggplot, controlling feature drawing order in QGIS, securing office servers, Stoic philosophy, grants and exceptions in Python, combining dictionaries in Julia, accessing columns and iterating rows in Julia DataFrames, government regulations, and managing webkitSpeechRecognition. In response to James' question about controlling the order of facets in ggplot, Arachne explains that the order of facets generated by `facet_wrap()` in ggplot is based on the factor level of the faceting variable. To control the order of facets, one can adjust the factor levels of the faceting variable. Arachne provides detailed steps and an example in R to illustrate this process.
