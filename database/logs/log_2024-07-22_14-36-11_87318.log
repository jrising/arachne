James sought to select rows from a matrix based on a BitVector in Julia. The issue was that the BitVector was a BitMatrix. I advised converting the BitMatrix to a BitVector using `vec(valid)` before using it to filter the rows in the matrix. By doing this, James should be able to achieve the desired 910x20 matrix from the operation.
