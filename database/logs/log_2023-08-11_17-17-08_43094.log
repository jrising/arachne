The conversation revolved around a report on marine spatial planning for offshore wind energy and its implications for a broad Ocean & Bay Plan in Delaware. The report highlighted potential environmental impacts of offshore wind projects, such as avian mortality and displacement, habitat disturbance, acoustic impacts on marine mammals and sea turtles, disruption of migratory routes, and impacts on endangered and rare species. It emphasized considering biologically significant impacts at the population level and the role of wildlife protection laws in managing impacts. The report also discussed avian species in the study area, including their migration patterns, distribution, and potential risks from offshore wind projects. It mentioned specific species of interest like Audubon's Shearwater, Common Loon, Razorbills, and Dovekies. The report utilized datasets from the USGS to analyze avian occurrence information and highlighted the need for species-specific decision-making in offshore wind development.
