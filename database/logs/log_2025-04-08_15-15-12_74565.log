In a previous conversation, James assigned a reading from the Stern Review on carbon pricing and emissions markets to his students. The discussion highlighted key messages, including the importance of credibility, flexibility, and predictability in policy design to effectively establish a carbon price. The conversation underscored concerns about investments in long-lived assets and the risks of locking economies into high-carbon trajectories during the transition to a credible carbon pricing framework. It also emphasized the significance of well-designed emissions trading schemes and the benefits of broadening their scope to enhance market efficiency, lower costs, and improve volatility. The potential impact on different sectors and the need for complementary measures beyond carbon pricing were also addressed. Multiple-choice questions were later suggested to assess students' comprehension of these concepts.
