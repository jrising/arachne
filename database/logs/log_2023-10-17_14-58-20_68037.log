James asked how to combine attributes from two different shapefiles in QGIS. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions to use the "Join Attributes by Location" tool in QGIS. They recommended loading both shapefiles, selecting the appropriate layers in the tool, specifying the geometric predicate as "intersects," and choosing the desired attributes to join. Arachne also mentioned the importance of ensuring that the coordinate reference systems (CRS) of both shapefiles are the same to avoid any issues, suggesting a reprojection if necessary.
