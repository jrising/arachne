The conversation discussed the difference between using `xr.open_rasterio` from the `xarray` package and `rioxarray.open_rasterio` from the `rioxarray` package to open BIL files in xarray. While both methods can open BIL files, the choice depends on specific needs. `rioxarray` is a specialized package that extends `xarray`'s functionality with raster data. It offers additional capabilities such as writing raster files in geotiff format, handling and preserving raster metadata, and providing more features for handling raster datasets. If the operations are less complex and do not require handling projections or metadata, `xr.open_rasterio` from `xarray` can be used. However, for more complex geospatial operations involving raster datasets, `rioxarray.open_rasterio` from `rioxarray` is recommended.
