Addressing data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process requires leveraging existing data management infrastructure, adopting consistent data collection and sharing practices, tailoring data collection for species-specific research, advancing data interoperability, expanding wildlife surveys and sensor networks, finding a balance between data openness and privacy, integrating new technologies, enhancing cloud computing capabilities, training stakeholders to improve technical capacity, and addressing domain- and region-specific data gaps. These recommendations are drawn from the RWSC 2024 report and Trice et al. 2021. By implementing these strategies, Delaware can effectively address its data gaps and support sustainable ocean and bay planning.
