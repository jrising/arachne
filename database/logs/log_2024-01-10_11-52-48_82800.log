James asked if there is a name for a meeting that occurs every three weeks. Arachne responded that there is no specific term for such meetings in common English usage. Arachne suggested using phrases such as "tri-weekly meetings," "meetings that occur every three weeks," or "three-week cycle meetings." It is important to clarify the frequency to avoid confusion, as "tri-weekly" could be interpreted as three times per week.
