The discussion focused on three activities: Recreational Fishing, Sand Borrow Locations, and Artificial Reefs. Recreational Fishing involves private boaters and fishing charters in specific areas, potentially conflicting with offshore wind development. The activity is ongoing, and the spatial extent is described in "10-minute grid cells." There are no specific temporal patterns mentioned. The potential expansion/changes include conflicts if turbines are installed in commonly fished areas, but wind projects could also serve as artificial reefs. The stakeholders are recreational fishers, offshore wind developers, and resource managers. The sources include NOAA-NMFS, Captain Seagullâ€™s Fishing Maps, and NOAA Nautical Charts. For Sand Borrow Locations, the USACE uses these areas for sand replenishment against beach erosion. The activity is ongoing, with known locations and potential locations. There are no specific temporal patterns mentioned. The potential expansion/changes include conflicts with wind development proposals. The stakeholders are the USACE, developers of offshore wind turbines, and the Delaware Geological Survey. The information is sourced from the Delaware Geological Society. Finally, Artificial Reefs are installed structures that serve as habitats for fish and fishing spots. The activity is ongoing and managed by state-specific Departments or Divisions of Fish & Wildlife. The spatial extent is mentioned but not specified. There are no specific temporal patterns mentioned. The potential expansion/changes include conflicts with wind turbine placements due to physical obstructions. The stakeholders are state Departments of Fish & Wildlife, recreational and commercial fishers, and offshore wind developers. The sources are the state Departments of Fish & Wildlife, but direct references are not provided.
