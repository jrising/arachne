In a previous conversation, James asked about how businesses in non-coastal areas support the economy along the coast, and the assistant provided examples such as supply chain, transportation, tourism, technology, and financial services. James then asked about the changes in coastal-related sectors in Delaware over the past 10 years, to which the assistant responded with potential changes related to renewable energy, changing tourism patterns, climate change, and technological advancements. Finally, James requested a comprehensive list of economic sectors in non-coastal parts of Delaware that support economic activity along the Delaware coast.
