The conversation revolved around constructing a random forest where the observations are distributions. The user inquired about the appropriate splitting rule and an R package that allows flexibility for this approach. The assistant suggested using the Modified Energy Statistics (MES) as a suitable splitting rule, which compares the energy distance between two distributions. The MES is robust and addresses the challenges posed by high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and asymmetrical shapes of the distributions. The assistant also mentioned that the `party` or `partykit` packages in R can be used for implementing a user-defined splitting criterion. However, customizing tree-based models for distributional observations can be complex and may require overriding specific functions such as `splitting()`, `predict()`, and `nodeapply()`. The assistant advised considering alternative approaches, such as transforming the data to a format more amenable to random forest modeling, or exploring other splitting criteria tailored to the specific characteristics of the univariate distributions.
