James asked how to get the keys of a dimension within the `run_timestep` function in the Mimi modeling framework in Julia, when he doesn't have access to the model. I advised him to pass the keys as an argument to the function. I suggested that he first retrieve the keys outside the function where he has access to the model using the `dim_keys` function. Then, he can pass these keys into his `run_timestep` function and use them within the function. I also mentioned that if he frequently needs to access the keys within `run_timestep`, it may indicate a need to improve the model's design by organizing it in a way that all the information needed for a timestep is available without needing direct access to the model's dimension keys.
