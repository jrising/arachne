James asked for information on the relationship between nutritional deficiencies or food insecurity and morbidity, with quantifiable examples. Arachne provided several reliable sources, including the Global Nutrition Report, the FAO's State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, the Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, the IHME's datasets, and the World Health Organization's publications and database. Arachne also mentioned the importance of considering factors such as socio-economic influences, local diets, and agrarian practices when interpreting the data. The specific quantification of the relationship can vary depending on the regional context and data sources.
