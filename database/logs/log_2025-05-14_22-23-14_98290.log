James sought clarification on Hotelling's Rule, initially linking it to the idea of maximizing welfare through investing rents from non-renewable resources into capital. I explained that Hotelling's Rule pertains to the price evolution of non-renewable resources, indicating that their net price should rise at the rate of interest to balance present and future extraction value. I introduced Hartwick's Rule, which complements Hotelling's by suggesting that sustainable welfare can be maintained if rents from non-renewable resources are reinvested in reproducible capital, thus supporting intergenerational equity. Ultimately, we connected the principles to understand the economic dynamics and sustainability implications of resource management.
