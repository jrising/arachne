James Rising inquired about creating a membership package for VELUX to join the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). The proposed three-year partnership would offer speaking opportunities, a platform to showcase smart home solutions, the chance to author papers, and consultancy hours. Emphasizing VELUX's focus on reducing scope 3 emissions and collaborative initiatives with suppliers, the discussion highlighted the importance of accurate emissions reporting through systems like CDP and the alignment with science-based targets. James later asked for the pricing of this membership package, to which I suggested that the cost would depend on the specific consultancy needs of VELUX and recommended reaching out to IMT for a personalized proposal.
