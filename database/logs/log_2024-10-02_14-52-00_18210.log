In the conversation, James sought assistance in drafting concise landing page texts for various graduate programs related to environmental policy, marine sciences, and economics. He provided detailed descriptions for the Master's in Marine Policy, Environmental Economics, Ph.D. in Marine Policy, Ph.D. in Environmental Economics, and natural science and engineering programs. For each program, I crafted succinct and compelling summaries highlighting key features, program strengths, and career pathways to effectively inform prospective students. Additionally, I directed inquiries about natural science and engineering degrees to Carlos Moffat, ensuring a polite and clear approach.
