In the previous conversation, James asked about the term for a field of wind turbines in the ocean, which I clarified as an "offshore wind farm" or "offshore wind project." He then inquired about the term for the wind potential used by wind farms, to which I explained that it is referred to as "wind energy" or "wind power." James also asked about recreational and commercial fishing in Delaware, and I informed him that while they may occur in some of the same areas, commercial fishing primarily takes place in the Delaware Bay and along the Atlantic coastline, while recreational fishing can occur in multiple locations. Lastly, James asked about the land-side infrastructure needed to support an offshore wind farm, and I provided a detailed list including an onshore substation, interconnection cables, grid connection, operations and maintenance facilities, port facilities, transport infrastructure, and transmission lines.
