This conversation covered various topics related to wind energy and offshore wind farms, fishing in Delaware, and land-side infrastructure for wind farms. The user asked about the term for a field of wind turbines in the ocean (offshore wind farm) and the term for the wind potential used by wind farms (wind energy). They also inquired about the overlap between recreational and commercial fishing in Delaware, land-side infrastructure needed for offshore wind farms (onshore substation, interconnection cables, grid connection, operations and maintenance facilities, port facilities, transport infrastructure, and transmission lines), and the meaning of a cable landing (the point where undersea cables emerge from the ocean and connect to land-based infrastructure).
