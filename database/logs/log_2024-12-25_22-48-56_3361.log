In a conversation about naming a collection of fields limited to read and add/modify operations, James recalled that BASIC referred to such data collections as "RECORDS" and sought a precise term. I explained that in BASIC, the term "FILE" encompassed multiple records. To better describe his needs, I suggested alternatives such as "Record Set," "Data Set," "Field Collection," "Data Pool," "Entry Log," "Field Repository," and "Value Collection." Each term reflects a focus on the data itself, avoiding implications of relational structure or extensive operational capabilities.
