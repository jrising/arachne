James sought information on corporate foundations and philanthropies that could help fill the funding gap for efficient buildings and multi-family housing. He requested more localized options in the DC area and less common national organizations with alignment to the goals of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). Key foundations identified include the Urban Land Institute, National Housing Trust, and the Energy Efficiency for All Initiative. James also inquired specifically about support for building performance standards, energy-efficient housing, and green lease leaders in the private sector. Notable organizations recommended were the U.S. Green Building Council, BOMA International, and the Citi Foundation, which promote sustainable practices in real estate, including green leasing.
