In the conversation, James provided a compilation of scholarly articles related to the economic impacts of climate change, including significant findings and publication details. The response involved creating a structured table summarizing references like Kahn et al. (2021) on the long-term macroeconomic effects of climate change, Pretis et al. (2018) on uncertain impacts of global temperature stabilization, and Bilal & KÃ¤nzig (2024) indicating macroeconomic damages from climate change could be significantly underestimated. The table also included information on contributions from authors like Moore & Diaz (2015) and Tol (2024), highlighting diverse research areas ranging from empirical evidence to integrated assessment models that stress the importance of addressing climate-related economic challenges.
