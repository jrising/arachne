The table provides damage estimates as a percentage of GDP for different scenarios and time intervals. Key highlights include the expected damage decreasing slightly from 2.37% to 2.39% for the 2011-2030 period under high mitigation policies, and a significant increase in expected damage under current policies to 10.22% by 2081-2100. Drought and flooding losses are expected to increase, while losses in agriculture turn from negative to positive. Livestock and fisheries generally experience negative damages. Energy supply and demand costs comprise a significant portion of damages, which are mitigated under high mitigation policies. Labor productivity losses due to climate change increase, and heat and cold-related mortality rates worsen under current policies. The adoption of high mitigation policies can significantly reduce damages, but the avoided costs decrease over time, indicating the increasing costs of mitigation. Overall, the analysis indicates that climate change damages could be a significant percentage of GDP, with the most significant damages from energy supply and demand costs, labor productivity losses, and catastrophic damage risks.
