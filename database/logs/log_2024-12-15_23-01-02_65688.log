James expressed concerns about his usual positive holiday card messages, such as "Wishing you adventure in the new year," especially with Trump being elected president again. He wondered if he should tone down the messages or adjust them. In response, I suggested several alternatives that maintain an optimistic yet considerate tone, such as "Wishing you peace and resilience in the coming year" and "May the coming year bring clarity and compassion to us all." These suggestions aimed to convey hope and goodwill in the current political climate, focusing on themes of strength, inspiration, and harmony.
