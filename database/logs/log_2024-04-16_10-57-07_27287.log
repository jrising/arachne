The discussion focused on using expenditure shares in a Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) model to understand how losses in one country affect another. Details on constructing the Expenditure Share Matrix, tracing losses through expenditure shares, using the Leontief Inverse for total effects, calculating initial GDP and its changes due to shocks were presented. The interaction highlighted steps to estimate total losses to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by considering value added coefficients and Leontief Inverse matrices in the MRIO context. The approach emphasized the interconnectedness of sectors and regions in assessing economic impacts, with a reminder of the model's simplifications and need for empirical validation.
