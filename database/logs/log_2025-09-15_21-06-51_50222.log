James sought a clean implementation of the logistic map in R. I provided the recurrence relation and a straightforward R function to compute the trajectory of the map. We discussed the comparison between using `accumulate` and `reduce` functions. I explained that `accumulate` tracks intermediate results, while `reduce` provides only the final outcome, making `reduce` generally faster for cases where the full sequence isn't needed. I included example implementations for both approaches, highlighting the scenarios for their best use, concluding that `reduce` would be quicker for just the final value.
