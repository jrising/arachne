In this conversation, James sought to understand the metrics that distinguish a buyers' market from a sellers' market in real estate. I responded by highlighting "Months of Inventory" (MSI) as a key metric, explaining that an MSI greater than 6 months indicates a buyers' market, while an MSI less than 6 months suggests a sellers' market. I also mentioned supporting metrics, such as Days on Market (DOM), median home prices, list-to-sale price ratios, buyer demand indicators like mortgage applications, and relevant economic indicators. Monitoring these metrics offers comprehensive insights into market conditions, aiding James in making informed decisions in real estate.
