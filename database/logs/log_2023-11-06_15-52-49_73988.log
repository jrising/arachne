In a conversation with Austin (age 3), his interests in various topics such as Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, Disney princess movies, reading, the moon, bones and skeletons, "bad guys," dragons, pirates, and fighting with swords were mentioned. I engaged Austin by discussing warehouses made of brick and how they can be used to store different things. I asked Austin to imagine warehouses where Elmo keeps his crayons or where pirates store shiny treasures.
