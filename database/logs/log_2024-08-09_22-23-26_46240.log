James seeks assistance with integrating raster tiles into a Leaflet map within his R Shiny app. While the tiles display correctly in a standalone HTML example, they are not showing up in the Shiny app. Upon investigation, it appears there may be issues with tile numbering, path structure, or directory setup. Recommendations include verifying tile naming conventions, ensuring proper directory placement within the `www` folder, and adjusting the `urlTemplate` path in the Leaflet code. Debugging tips are provided to help diagnose and resolve the tile loading issue.
