James identified challenges in the Greater Washington region related to outdated building infrastructure and an unprepared workforce, highlighting the need for joint solutions to achieve social and environmental objectives. He proposed two initiatives: a DC Region Green Buildings Career Map to connect job seekers with opportunities, and a vendor matchmaking service to enhance access to training programs. I responded with measurable goals for these initiatives, including training a specific number of residents annually, ensuring a percentage come from disadvantaged backgrounds, connecting job seekers to opportunities, and increasing business participation in the matchmaking service. Additionally, I emphasized goals related to environmental impact, such as reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. I recommended ensuring all goals are SMARTâ€”Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
