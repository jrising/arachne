James reached out for guidance on completing an IRB protocol form for his project involving interviews and surveys with stakeholders in the Delaware Bay area. The AI assistant provided a comprehensive outline of the information that needs to be included in the section describing procedures involving human subjects. These details encompassed recruitment, informed consent process, methodology, data handling, risk/benefit analysis, procedure timing, debriefing if applicable, and inclusion of surveys and research measures. The assistant emphasized the importance of adhering to ethical guidelines and reassured James that the IRB review aims to ensure the ethical treatment of human subjects rather than being a hindrance.
