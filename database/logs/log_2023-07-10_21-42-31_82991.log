James is working on a project for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) to identify available datasets and data gaps related to Delaware's waters. He needs to fill out the IRB protocol form, and he asks for help on the "procedures involving human subjects" section. The assistant provides guidance on what information should be included in this section, such as recruitment methods, informed consent process, methodology, data handling, risk/benefit analysis, procedure timing, debriefing (if applicable), and inclusion of surveys and research measures.
