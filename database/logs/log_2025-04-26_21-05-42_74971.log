In a previous discussion, James inquired about calculating the Lyapunov exponent for the system defined by \(y_t = a y_{t-1} + b y_{t-2}\). I outlined the procedure, which includes linearizing the system, constructing the Jacobian matrix, and determining its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation \(\lambda^2 - a\lambda - b = 0\). The Lyapunov exponent is then calculated using the log of the largest absolute eigenvalue, with interpretations shared based on its signâ€”indicating stability or instability of the system. Additionally, I mentioned the potential need for numerical computation for non-trivial parameters \(a\) and \(b\), offering further assistance if needed.
