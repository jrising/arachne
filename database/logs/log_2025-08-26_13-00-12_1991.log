In a conversation about using the MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) package in R to handle missing data, James raised concerns about random noise in imputation results despite strong correlations among columns. I suggested strategies to enhance the quality of imputation, including increasing iterations, evaluating the imputation model, modifying the predictor matrix, and utilizing external information. James then inquired about determining convergence, specifically regarding number of imputations and iterations. I recommended visual inspections, monitoring diagnostics, and using the Gelman-Rubin Diagnostic. When James faced an error related to the Gelman-Rubin method, I provided troubleshooting steps, emphasizing the need to ensure variable names are correctly referenced and the dataset is accurately specified in the modeling functions. I also shared an example workflow for clarity.
