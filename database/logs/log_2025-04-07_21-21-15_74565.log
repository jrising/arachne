In a recent discussion, the user outlined the formation of an advisory group for a grant project focused on assessing the economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK and the benefits of adaptation actions. The project aims to produce UK-specific climate damage scenarios, leveraging a hybrid approach that integrates UK sector modeling within a macroeconomic framework like NiGEM. Key objectives include understanding macroeconomic impacts, quantifying fiscal risks, and informing public spending decisions on adaptation. Additionally, the project emphasizes transparency in modeling tools and aims to facilitate adaptive decision-making and knowledge sharing on a global scale. Notably, it will draw on existing programs, gather expertise from various stakeholders, and publish data outputs to guide policy. The advisory group will play a pivotal role in integrating these insights into strategic government actions.
