James inquired about locations in England associated with the "land of strange adventures" from the death of Arthur. I suggested Tintagel Castle in Cornwall and Glastonbury, outlining their connections to Arthurian legends. He then asked if Camelot is referred to as Winchester; I confirmed this association based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's writings. Lastly, he referenced a chapter in Book 4 where three knights meet three ladies by a fountain. I explained that such enchanted settings are more symbolic than real geographical locations, representing themes of chivalry and trials faced by the knights.
