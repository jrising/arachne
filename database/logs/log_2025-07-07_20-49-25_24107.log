James Rising received an email from Md. Mizanur Rahman, expressing interest in joining his lab as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Delaware. Rahman detailed his qualifications in Fisheries Science and his current research on aquatic resource assessment in the Sundarbans. In response, James acknowledged Rahman's enthusiasm and qualifications but noted a lack of alignment with his research. He suggested that Rahman reach out to Dr. Anna Birkenbach, whose work aligns better with Rahman's interests. James provided a link for scheduling a Zoom meeting to discuss further. The conversation emphasized professionalism while guiding the candidate towards a more suitable opportunity.
