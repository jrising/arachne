James sought assistance with a hanging async function in Pyppeteer that retrieves a page's content. He suspected that `page.goto` or `page.content` were causing the issue. I recommended several strategies to resolve the problem: increasing the timeout for page navigation, implementing try-catch blocks around each await to capture specific errors, using `page.waitForNavigation()` to handle redirects, and enabling logging for diagnostics. I emphasized the importance of detailed error handling to prevent script hangs and encouraged debugging techniques to gain further insights into the underlying issues.
