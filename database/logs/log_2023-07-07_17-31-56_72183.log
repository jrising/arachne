James requests edits and feedback on a section of his Service Statement for his tenure dossier. He provides a description of his writing style and a peer's statement for comparison. He then shares a section about his coordination of workshops, conference sessions, and speaker series, as well as his involvement in policy discussions, institutional organization, manuscript reviews, and public engagement. Arachne provides an edited version of the section with improved clarity and structure.
