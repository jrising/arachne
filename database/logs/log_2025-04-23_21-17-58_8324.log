In a prior conversation, James expressed a desire to archive a WordPress site by creating a static version, ensuring he wouldn't need to maintain a WordPress installation. I provided a step-by-step guide to help him achieve this, which included backing up the site, using plugins like Simply Static or WP2Static to generate static HTML files, and deploying those files to a static web server or service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). I emphasized verifying the static site after deployment and updating DNS settings as necessary. The discussion focused on preserving content while streamlining maintenance efforts.
