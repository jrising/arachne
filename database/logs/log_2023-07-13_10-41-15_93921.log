In Julia, specifying the types of function outputs can significantly improve performance, as the language uses type inference to optimize code at runtime. However, storing results in a vector of type `Any` mitigates these performance gains. The Julia documentation recommends type stability and avoiding containers of `Any` for best performance. By specifying concrete types for function inputs and outputs, you can achieve performance benefits from type-specific optimizations. However, this may limit the flexibility of the function to accept and return specific types.
