James provided a list of disciplines from a survey of earned doctorates and a collection of disciplines from CVs. He asked for a mapping from each CV discipline to one of the doctorate survey disciplines. Arachne proposed mappings for various disciplines such as "Government and Social Policy" to Social sciences - Public policy analysis, and "Hominid Paleobiology" to Biological and biomedical sciences - Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology. Arachne highlighted the need for expert judgment in adjusting mappings for unique or interdisciplinary disciplines.
