James sought clarification on the "spring meetings" mentioned by colleagues involved with the UN and finance ministers. In response, I explained that these meetings refer to the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group, held annually in April, primarily in Washington, D.C. I emphasized the significance of these meetings as they gather key figures to discuss global economic issues, development, and finance, suggesting that staying informed or attending might be advantageous for James's work in global economic policy.
