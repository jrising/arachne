In a previous conversation, James asked about the infinite sum of X / (1 + d)^t. Arachne explained that this formula represents the present value of a perpetuity, which is a series of equal infinite payments or cash flows that occur at regular intervals. The present value of a perpetuity can be calculated using the formula PV = X / d, where X is the payment or cash inflow at the end of each single period, and d is the discount rate per period. Arachne also emphasized that X and d need to belong to the same period, for example, if X is an annual interest, d should also be an annual discount rate.
