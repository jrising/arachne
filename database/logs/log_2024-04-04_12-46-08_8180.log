James sought guidance on fitting a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using the depmixS4 package in R, inquiring about handling multiple response variables and NAs. Arachne provided detailed steps on formulating the model formula for multiple responses, advised on managing missing values by preprocessing the data, and suggested approaches to address the "NA/NaN/Inf" error related to NAs and model complexity. The discussion emphasized data integrity, model simplification, and parameter initialization to improve model stability and convergence. James was encouraged to explore different initialization methods and consider model complexity implications, tailoring the HMM setup to the specific requirements of his data to enhance model performance.
