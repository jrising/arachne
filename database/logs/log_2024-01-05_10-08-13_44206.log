James asked how to hide a linewidth legend in ggplot, and the assistant provided a solution by using the `show.legend = FALSE` argument for the `geom_line()` function. James then mentioned that they also have other aesthetics for which they want to show the legend, specifically for the `geom_polygon`, where they want to hide only the linewidth legend. The assistant suggested using the `guides()` function in combination with the `override.aes` argument to customize the legends individually. The assistant provided example code to achieve this, and encouraged James to adapt it to their specific case or ask further questions if needed.
