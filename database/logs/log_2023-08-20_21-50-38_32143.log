In this conversation, James asked how to return HTML composed of a list of items in Flask, where each item takes its HTML from a template. The AI assistant responded by explaining how to use the `render_template()` function in Flask with a `for` loop in a Jinja2 template to render a list of items dynamically. The AI provided an example code snippet for the Flask app and the HTML template, demonstrating how to iterate through each item in the list and fill in the corresponding fields in the HTML. The AI also mentioned that HTML templates should be placed in a `/templates` folder by default in the Flask application directory.
