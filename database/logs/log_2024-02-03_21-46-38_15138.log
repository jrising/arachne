The conversation involved James asking about the return value of the `.each()` command applied to a list of DOM elements in jQuery, specifically if it returns a promise. Arachne clarified that the `.each()` function does not return a promise directly, but instead returns the original jQuery object to preserve chainability of jQuery methods. Arachne then provided an alternative approach using the `.map()` function to create an array of promises and `Promise.all()` to create a single promise that resolves when all operations have finished. Arachne presented an example code snippet to demonstrate this approach. The outcome of the discussion was James gaining an understanding of how to use `.map()` and `Promise.all()` to handle asynchronous operations on a list of DOM elements in jQuery.
