James inquired about the difference between Return on Investment (ROI) and Economic Rate of Return (ERR). I explained that ROI is a simple measure of profitability, calculated as \((\text{Net Profit} / \text{Total Investment Cost}) \times 100\), but it does not account for the time value of money. Conversely, ERR, similar to Internal Rate of Return (IRR), considers the timing of cash flows by discounting future returns, providing a more comprehensive view of an investment's profitability over time. Thus, while ROI is useful for quick assessments, ERR offers deeper insights into the true value of long-term investments.
