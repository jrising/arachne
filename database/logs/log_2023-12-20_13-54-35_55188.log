The applicant, Haile Tamiru, has a background in Agricultural Economics and is motivated to bring positive changes to Ethiopia through research in climate change, agricultural commodity value enhancement, and poverty reduction. Their research proposal focuses on studying the determinants of farmers' willingness to participate in soil and watershed conservation practices. The statement lacks specific references to existing literature or a clear methodology. There is no mention of the applicant's quantitative capacity. While the statement demonstrates medium fluency in English, it could benefit from a more compelling writing style. The applicant does not offer justification for any weaknesses in their application. However, the mention of their background in the public sector, their desire to develop national programs, and their unique perspective as an Ethiopian applicant contribute to diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations.
