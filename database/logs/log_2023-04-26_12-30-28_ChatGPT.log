To prevent an external hard drive from going to sleep or powering down when not in use on a Linux system, `hdparm` can be used to disable power management. If APM is not supported, alternative methods include using a simple loop to periodically read from the drive or mounting the drive with the `noatime` option. These methods will keep the drive awake and can be run as a script in the background or set up as a cron job. It is important to note that keeping the drive constantly active may increase power consumption and reduce the drive's lifespan.
