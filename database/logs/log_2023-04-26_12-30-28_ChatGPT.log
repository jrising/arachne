The discussion focused on preventing an external hard drive connected to a Linux box from going to sleep or powering down when not in use. Initially, the conversation revolved around using the `hdparm` utility to disable power management. When it was discovered that APM was not supported by the drive, alternative methods were suggested, such as using a shell script with a loop to periodically read from the drive or mounting the drive with the `noatime` option. The user also inquired about using `crontab` to run the `dd` command periodically. It was explained that the `dd` command could be added to the user's crontab file without any additional steps required for activation.
