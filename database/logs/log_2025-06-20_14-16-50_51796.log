In this conversation, the user presented a component for modeling capital feedback effects within an integrated assessment model using the Mimi framework. The user requested documentation not focused on parameters and variables, but rather on the key equations used in the model. In response, detailed LaTeX documentation was provided, outlining critical equations such as initial capital calculation, capital baseline update, capital level adjustment, and the calculation of adjusted GDP, consumption, and regional GDP aggregation. Each equation was accompanied by descriptions of newly introduced parameters, such as savings rate, depreciation rate, capital share, and real GDP impacts, explaining their roles in the model's dynamics. Ultimately, the discussion emphasized the mathematical relationships governing capital's influence on economic growth.
