James Rising requested assistance in responding to an email from Amoda Oyefolake, who sought supervision for a Ph.D. in Marine Chemistry at the University of Delaware. The discussion emphasized clarifying the relevance of various academic programs and funding constraints. Key points included that the Masters in Marine Policy has transitioned to an Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track, while the Ph.D. programs have limited funding. James aimed to offer guidance on program selection without excessive enthusiasm and to direct the applicant to Professor Xinfeng Liang for natural science inquiries. The final response encouraged mentioning relevant research interests in the statement of purpose, ensuring the communication remained concise and professional.
