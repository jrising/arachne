The conversation detailed a grant proposal titled BACCARAT (Benefits And Costs of Cooling Accounting for Risks And Tipping Points), involving participants from the University of Delaware, the London School of Economics, and the University of Chicago. The proposal outlines the adverse impacts of climate change and the potential of climate cooling, particularly Solar Radiation Management (SRM), to mitigate these effects while also presenting risks, such as new tipping points. Key questions focus on how climate cooling could both reduce and increase risks associated with tipping points, and how to optimally plan climate experimentation. The methodology includes expanding the Model for Economic Tipping point Analysis (META) to assess economic impacts and benefits of various cooling strategies. The team comprises experts in climate economics and geoengineering, with a clear commitment to producing open-access data and models to inform climate policy decisions.
