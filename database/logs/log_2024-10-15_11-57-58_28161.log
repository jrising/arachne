James Rising engaged in correspondence with Anqi Wang, a prospective PhD student interested in the Environmental Economics program at the University of Delaware. Anqi highlighted her impressive background, including a double major in Economics and Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and research experience on environmental justice and GDP loss estimation during hurricanes. James acknowledged her qualifications, invited her to complete a form for better advisor-student matching, and encouraged her to mention him in her application statement. Anqi confirmed her completion of the form, expressed excitement about aligning her research interests with James's work on climate change, and planned to reference him in her application. James then drafted a professional response thanking Anqi and offering the option for a Zoom chat, noting her as a strong candidate and expressing eagerness to review her application.
