The conversation focused on the project "Accelerating Investment in Adaptation and Resilience by Finance Ministries and Economic Decision-Makers," which aims to address the critical issue of underfunded climate adaptation. In response to the project's overview, I crafted a concise paragraph suitable for high-level stakeholders. The project seeks to provide critical macroeconomic insights and actionable policy recommendations by reviewing literature, developing case studies in various countries, and engaging with financial decision-makers, ultimately supporting adaptation efforts leading up to COP30 in Brazil.
