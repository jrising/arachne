This conversation centered around the topic of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in determining the fate of the oceans. The example provided was focused on the application of CBA to mitigate ocean acidification caused by CO2 emissions. The benefits of mitigation include reduced damage to marine ecosystems, preservation of biodiversity, and reduced risk of extreme events. The costs include implementation costs, opportunity costs, and transition costs. The net benefit can be calculated by subtracting the estimated costs from the estimated benefits. It was emphasized that decision-making should consider more than just monetary values, and the limitations of CBA in capturing the full value of environmental goods and services.
