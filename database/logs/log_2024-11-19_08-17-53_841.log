In a series of conversations, James sought information on foundations and funders that support projects at the intersection of climate and health, specifically related to the built environment. He initially requested national foundations and their funding amounts, leading to suggestions like the Kresge Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and others, highlighting their potential funding ranges and focus areas. As James specified a need for lesser-known funders and those targeting economically disadvantaged communities, additional options were proposed, including regional foundations and community-focused organizations. Finally, with an emphasis on the DC area, lesser-known funders such as the DC Sustainable Energy Utility, Consumer Health Foundation, and DC Department of Energy & Environment were provided, along with suggestions for local partnerships and universities. Throughout, the focus remained on improving health outcomes and addressing climate challenges in underserved regions.
