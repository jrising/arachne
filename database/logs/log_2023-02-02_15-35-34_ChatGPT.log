 Two-way clustering of errors is a statistical method that clusters errors from two different sources simultaneously to identify underlying patterns. It has been used in various applications like image analysis and text mining. In econometrics, the two-way clustered standard errors approach assumes independence within clusters, homoscedasticity of error terms within clusters, normality of error terms within clusters, and cluster-level mean independence. These assumptions should be carefully evaluated before applying the approach to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained.
