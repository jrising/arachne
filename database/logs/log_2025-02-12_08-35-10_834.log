In a discussion about the value of having an Advisory Board for James's business engagement programs, I provided a detailed invitation that emphasized the board's influence on sustainability initiatives like Green Lease Leaders and the Building Innovation Hub. We explored how the Advisory Board aligns with the IMT strategic plan's three goals: (1) by influencing equitable building performance requirements through stakeholder engagement and federal action, (2) by promoting accessible decarbonization via inclusive workforce development and changing industry norms, and (3) by enhancing organizational excellence through strategic partnerships and continuous learning. Overall, we identified the board's role in driving innovation and fostering collaboration within IMT's objectives.
