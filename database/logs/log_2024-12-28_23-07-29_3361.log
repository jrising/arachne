James inquired about a family story involving an ancestor captured on a ship, where a deal was made to spare lives based on the number of men the ancestor could walk past if he was killed. I noted that while this specific narrative doesn't have a widely-known counterpart, it shares themes common in folklore and maritime legends, like sacrifice and clever negotiations for survival. I suggested that James could research maritime folklore or consult local historical societies for similar accounts, and encouraged checking family records for more context.
