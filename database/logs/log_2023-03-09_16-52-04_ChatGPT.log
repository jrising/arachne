A geodatabase can include gridded information such as raster datasets or raster catalogs, which are used to store and manage raster data in GIS systems. In addition to raster data, a geodatabase can also store vector data and tabular data, allowing for the integration of different data types and formats into a single tool for managing spatial information.
