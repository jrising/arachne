Inquiring about the inclusion of gridded information in a geodatabase, James learned that a geodatabase can indeed store gridded data, such as satellite imagery, digital elevation models, and climate models. The geodatabase can manage this raster data through the use of gridded data structures like raster datasets and raster catalogs. A raster dataset can be a single layer with multiple bands or channels, while a raster catalog organizes multiple raster datasets by theme. Furthermore, a geodatabase can also store vector data (points, lines, polygons) and tabular data, enabling the integration of various data types and formats into a single, versatile geodatabase. Ultimately, this makes geodatabases a powerful tool for managing, analyzing, and visualizing complex spatial information.
