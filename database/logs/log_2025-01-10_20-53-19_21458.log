James inquired about the Andromeda galaxy's impending collision with the Milky Way. I confirmed that Andromeda is on a collision course, expected to occur in about 4.5 billion years. We discussed the merging of the two galaxies, potentially creating "Milkomeda" or "Milkdromeda." Despite the vast scale of the collision, individual stars are unlikely to collide due to the large distances separating them, meaning our solar system may remain relatively unscathed. The interaction will nonetheless significantly alter the structure and shape of both galaxies.
