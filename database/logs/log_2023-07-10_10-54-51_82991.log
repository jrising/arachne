In a previous conversation, James asked whether the order of variables used in an ANOVA matters. I explained that the order of variables does not affect the statistical relationship being tested in an ANOVA. What is crucial is correctly assigning variables to their roles as independent variables (factors) and dependent variables (outcome or response). However, in complex multiple factor ANOVAs, the order and interplay of variables can impact interaction terms and should be considered during interpretation. I also emphasized that statistical significance does not guarantee practical significance, so findings should always be interpreted in context.
