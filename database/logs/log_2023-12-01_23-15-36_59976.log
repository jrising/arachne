In a previous conversation, James asked about the provision storage on the whaling ship Pequod in Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick*. Arachne confirmed that the ship's voyage was intended to last around three years. Arachne then provided a list of typical provisions found on whaling ships, including hardtack, salted or pickled foods, preserved fruits and vegetables, flour or oatmeal, beans and peas, dried meats, rum or grog, coffee or tea, sugar or molasses, and water. When James asked for estimated quantities of these provisions for the full Pequod crew, Arachne generated a table with daily and 3-year voyage quantities per person and the full crew. The estimates were based on historical records and general provisioning guidelines for whaling ships, accounting for variations in crew size, voyage duration, and potential supplementation. Arachne noted that these estimates were approximations and actual amounts would depend on specific crew preferences and available resources.
