James inquired whether Black slaves in 17th-century Salem would have been referred to as "slaves." I responded that they would likely have been called "slaves," as historical records from colonial America commonly used this term to denote those subjected to enforced servitude. I also mentioned that other terms, such as "servants," might have been used, though they often lacked the distinction between indentured servants and actual slaves. Furthermore, I emphasized that the terminology reflected the racial hierarchies and attitudes of the time, often dehumanizing the individuals involved.
