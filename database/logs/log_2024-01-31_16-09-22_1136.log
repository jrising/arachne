The survey responses from stakeholders in the Delaware ocean and bay area have identified several data gaps related to activities and other data categories. The data gaps include the need for real-time monitoring of whale presence in heavily utilized areas, information on shifts in marine species populations due to climate change, accurate population and species data for protected species, direct notification of impactful projects to relevant organizations, assessment of wetland health and statewide plans for controlling flooding, limited sediment data for modeling environmental phenomena, more robust biological data, comprehensive data on sea level rise, salinity, and contaminants of emerging concern, financial support for expanding a data portal for the Delaware River Basin, and the assessment of data's value to the Sussex County tourism economy. Additionally, stakeholders highlighted the need for improvements in communication, data collection frequency, transparency in funding environmental work, and participation in coordination committees and policy convenings. These recommendations aim to enhance overall data collection, communication, and utilization practices.
