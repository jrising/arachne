James sought assistance in adding a new option to a Selectize.js input (#sector_select) using Javascript. Initially, the assistant provided a code snippet for adding an option and explained the process step by step. James encountered an issue where an "undefined" option was added instead of the desired one. The assistant identified the problem as a likely incorrect object structure passed to the `addOption` method and offered a corrected code example. Common issues and debugging steps were provided to help James troubleshoot effectively.
