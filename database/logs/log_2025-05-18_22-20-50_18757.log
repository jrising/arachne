James inquired about the meaning of the "share" of capital and labor in Cobb-Douglas production functions. I explained that this "share" is represented by the exponents \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in the production function \(Y = A \cdot K^\alpha \cdot L^\beta\). These exponents indicate the proportional contribution of capital and labor to output, showing how changes in each input affect total production. For example, if \(\alpha = 0.3\) and \(\beta = 0.7\), 30% of income comes from capital, and 70% from labor. Additionally, I clarified that \(\alpha + \beta = 1\) indicates constant returns to scale, while values less than or greater than one indicate decreasing or increasing returns to scale, respectively.
