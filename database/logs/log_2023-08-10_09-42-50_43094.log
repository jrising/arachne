James asked if he should opt for tire balancing when buying tires from Costco. Arachne recommended getting the tires balanced as it promotes smooth driving, reduces vibrations, improves tire lifespan, and prevents uneven wear on the car's suspension. Arachne also advised that since it's convenient and cost-effective to do it at Costco, it's better to get it done there instead of needing a separate trip to a tire service shop later.
