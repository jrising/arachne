James asked if he should get his tires balanced when purchasing new tires from Costco. Arachne recommended getting the tires balanced, as it ensures even weight distribution around the vehicle's axle, promotes smooth and safe driving, improves tire lifespan, and prevents uneven wear on the suspension. Arachne also highlighted the convenience of getting the tires balanced at Costco, as any balance-related problems can be addressed during the initial installation, avoiding the need for a separate trip to a tire service shop.
