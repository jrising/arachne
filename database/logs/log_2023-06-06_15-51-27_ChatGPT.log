The discussion focused on identifying the name of a piece of furniture with small drawers in both general and office contexts. The terms "chest of drawers" and "dresser" were mentioned as common names for such furniture. In an office context, a "filing cabinet" or "file cabinet" was suggested for furniture with larger drawers, while a "desk organizer," "desktop organizer," "storage cabinet," or "storage unit" were proposed for furniture with small drawers. The concept of a "drawer organizer" or "multi-drawer storage chest" was introduced for furniture designed to hold specific items like stationery or craft supplies. Lastly, the idea of a "pedestal" or "mobile pedestal" was mentioned for smaller cabinets with mixed small and larger drawers, typically used for personal storage and file storage respectively.
