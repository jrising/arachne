James sought guidance on building a Python tool to find PDFs from academic paper DOIs by utilizing Google Scholar's "all N versions" link. I cautioned him about the challenges and ethical issues surrounding web scraping on Google Scholar, given their terms of service. I suggested using the `scholarly` package, although it may not support the "all versions" feature consistently. I provided a conceptual code snippet using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the necessary links while emphasizing the legal and ethical considerations. Additionally, I recommended exploring API alternatives, such as CrossRef or Unpaywall, to access open-access versions legally and suggested incorporating user input to navigate potential compliance risks.
