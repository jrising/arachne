In a previous conversation, James asked about the BIOS startup key for a Dell OptiPlex desktop, and the assistant provided information on how to access the BIOS setup using the `F2` or `F12` keys. James then inquired about setting up a computer to boot from a USB drive within Windows, and the assistant provided step-by-step instructions on how to do so. The assistant emphasized the importance of removing the USB drive after use to avoid unintended booting from it in the future. The assistant also acknowledged that the steps may vary depending on the computer's make and model and offered further assistance if needed.
