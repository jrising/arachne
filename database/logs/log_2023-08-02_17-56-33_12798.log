James wanted to remove the year dimension from a variable (`FIPS`) in `xarray`, as the values for this variable repeat for every year. The assistant suggested checking if the variable is constant over years for each `poly_idx` and provided code to confirm this. If the variable is constant, the assistant recommended two methods to drop the year dimension: using `isel` to select the first index along the year dimension or using `squeeze` to remove dimensions of length one.
