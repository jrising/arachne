The discussion covered various topics related to agriculture and spatial analysis. The USDA conducts two surveys on crop production: the Acreage Report, which estimates the total number of acres planted for major field crops in the U.S., and the Crop Production Report, which provides a more detailed estimate of the expected size of the harvest. The US Census of Agriculture is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches conducted every five years, while the annual survey by USDA NASS provides regular and up-to-date estimates of agricultural production. Python and R scripts were provided for reading historical futures contract data from B3 and estimating spatial autocorrelation in spatial datasets. Methods for addressing errors were also discussed.
