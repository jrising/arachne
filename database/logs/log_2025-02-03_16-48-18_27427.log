James sought a coversheet template for organizing important documents and key locations. I provided a comprehensive template featuring sections for the document title, date, owner, description, importance level, attachments, key information with location and purpose, notes, last review date, and a sign-off. I encouraged customization of the template to fit his needs and highlighted the importance of regularly updating the "Last Reviewed" section and maintaining a digital version for easier updates and backups.
