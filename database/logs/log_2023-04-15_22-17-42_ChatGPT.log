James asked the AI assistant to evaluate statements of purpose from candidates for a research assistant position. The AI provided guidance on evaluating the candidates based on self-sufficiency and capability, programming languages, other concrete skills, communication, climate economics, and DEI considerations. James then provided statements of purpose from several candidates, and the AI provided evaluations for each candidate based on the given metrics. Finally, James requested a tabular summary of the evaluations.
