James inquired about creating a conditional in a bash script that executes code only if a specified file does not exist. In response, I provided a clear example using an `if` statement combined with the `!` operator and the `-e` flag. The sample script checks for the file's existence; if it does not exist, it prints a message and executes the designated code. If the file is present, it simply exits. James was directed to replace the placeholder with the actual file name for implementation.
