James inquired how to calculate the mean value of every column in a DataFrame using Julia. I provided two methods using the `select` and `combine` functions from the DataFrames.jl package. He then asked about randomly sampling `N` values from these mean values across `C < N` columns. Initially, I misinterpreted his request, suggesting to sample random rows instead of columns. After clarification from James, I revised my response to explain how to randomly select column indices and gather corresponding mean values from the single-row `mean_values` DataFrame. I presented an updated example that included sampling column indices and retrieving mean values accurately.
