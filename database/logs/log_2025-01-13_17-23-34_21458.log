James inquired about a standard Python library to load an "asc" file, specifically seeking to extract data for integration into an xarray dataset. I recommended using the `rasterio` library, outlining steps to install it, read the ASC file, and convert it to an xarray DataArray. I provided a sample code snippet demonstrating how to use `rasterio` and `rioxarray` to achieve this, emphasizing seamless metadata handling and the importance of nodata management if needed. This solution supports James's aim of utilizing geospatial data in his modeling work effectively.
