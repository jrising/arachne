James sought assistance in drafting a response to an email from Nasrin Badrzadeh, a prospective graduate student interested in continuing her studies in Water Resource Engineering. Nasrin expressed interest in working on Hydrology and Watershed Management, Climate Change Impact on Hydrology and Water Quality, and Surface Water-Groundwater Interactions. Based on her background and interests, Arachne suggested that the Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program or one of the natural science programs offered by the Marine Science & Policy school might be appropriate paths for Nasrin to consider. Arachne also advised Nasrin to contact Professor Xinfeng Liang for more information on the natural science programs. Arachne highlighted that funding for these programs can be limited and encouraged Nasrin to apply by December 15 to be considered for any available funds. Arachne recommended Nasrin to mention her interest in Climate Change Impact on Hydrology and Water Quality in her statement of purpose, as it aligns well with James' research. James approved the response and offered James Rising's contact information at the School of Marine Science & Policy, UDel.
