James had a question about TikiWiki's database update system. He mentioned that after making changes to correct some errors, the system still wanted to run certain SQL files that had already been modified. Arachne explained that the TikiWiki architecture stores information about the database schema in a specific table called `tiki-schema`, which tracks the versions of executed SQL files. Arachne suggested checking the status of executed SQL files by querying this table and manually updating it with the respective file names and modification timestamps. She provided SQL commands for inserting a new entry or updating an existing one in the `tiki-schema` table. Arachne cautioned James to backup the database and ensure the updates were successful before executing these commands to avoid any unintended side effects.
