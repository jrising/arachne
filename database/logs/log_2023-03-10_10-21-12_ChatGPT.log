In a previous conversation, James asked if the Volga, Vyatka, Kama, Oka, and Ural rivers and their tributaries are all on the same continent. My response affirmed that all these rivers are indeed located on the same continent, which is Asia. I mentioned that the Volga River is the largest river in Europe and flows through Russia, while the other rivers mentioned are also in Russia and part of the European portion of the country. However, I highlighted that the Ural River acts as the boundary between Europe and Asia, with its western side in Europe and its eastern side in Asia.
