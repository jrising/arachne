In this conversation, James asked about the correct usage of "I" and "me" in a sentence. The assistant explained that the correct phrase is "It could be Alice, Bob, and me." The assistant provided the rule of using "I" as the subject of a verb and "me" as the object of a verb or preposition. The assistant suggested removing the other people from the sentence to check if it still makes sense.
