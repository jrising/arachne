In a discussion about the correct grammar usage, James asked whether it is correct to say "It could be Alice, Bob, and I" or "It could be Alice, Bob, and me". The assistant responded that the correct phrase is "It could be Alice, Bob, and me" because the pronoun is the object of the verb "be". The assistant explained the rule of thumb to use "I" when it is the subject of a verb and "me" when it is the object of a verb or preposition. The assistant suggested removing the other people from the sentence as a way to check the correctness, with "It could be me" sounding correct and "It could be I" sounding incorrect.
