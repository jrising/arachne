In this conversation, James asked about the multipliers used in Input-Output (I/O) models, specifically whether they represent the effect of an additional marginal dollar or an average dollar. Arachne explained that the multipliers in I/O models represent the cumulative impacts of an additional dollar spent in a particular sector of the economy. These multipliers quantify the total effect per additional dollar spent, taking into account both the direct effects and the indirect and induced effects in other sectors. Arachne also emphasized that these multipliers are estimates based on assumptions and the specific structure of the I/O model, and may not perfectly predict real-world impacts.
