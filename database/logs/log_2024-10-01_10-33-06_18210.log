The discussion focused on enhancing marine spatial planning (MSP) by addressing data gaps that impact effective ocean management. James prompted an exploration of how findings from Delaware illustrate broader MSP challenges worldwide and emphasized the necessity of high-resolution, up-to-date data across various categories (physical, biological, etc.). I highlighted the need for an interdisciplinary approach to integrate natural and social data, suggesting that advancements in remote sensing and eDNA could improve marine data quality. The conversation underscored the importance of stakeholder involvement in the MSP process to better balance diverse marine activities and promote healthier ecosystems, ultimately contributing to sustainable human well-being.
