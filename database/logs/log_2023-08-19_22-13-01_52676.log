In a previous conversation, James asked how to find a file in Python when he knows the directory but only part of the file name. The assistant provided a solution using the `glob` module in Python. The assistant shared a code example that demonstrates how to use the `glob` module to find files based on a specified pattern. The code uses the `glob.glob()` function to search for files in a directory that contain the provided filename part. The assistant reminded James that the search is case sensitive and that the filename part can be located anywhere in the filename. If multiple files match the pattern, all matching files are returned. If no files match, an empty list is returned.
