Daniel Ozoemena, a graduate from the Federal University of Technology Owerri in Nigeria, reached out to James Rising expressing interest in joining the Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program. Daniel's background in agribusiness aligns with James' research areas focused on the impacts of climate change, complex systems, and food and fisheries. The reply highlighted the limitations of funding within the program, recommended seeking funding from external sources, and advised reaching out to the program administration for accurate information regarding application deadlines and availability. James encouraged Daniel to mention his name in the statement of purpose and urged him to apply by December 15 to be considered for any available school funds. The response was then sent to Daniel.
