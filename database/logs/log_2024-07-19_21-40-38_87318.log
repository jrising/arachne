James sought guidance on accessing a Shiny reactive value, `input$selected_rate`, encountering an error. The discussion highlighted using reactive contexts like `observe()` to access `input$selected_rate` within Shiny, ensuring it reacts to changes. The provided code snippets illustrated setting up the UI with a slider input and creating a server function with an `observe()` block to handle `selected_rate` changes. By deploying `observe()` and `renderText()`, James can interact with `input$selected_rate` effectively in Shiny applications.
