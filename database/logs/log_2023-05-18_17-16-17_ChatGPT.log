The initial conversation revolved around James seeking assistance in refining a two-minute verbal pitch for a new project on the clean energy transition. The assistant provided an edited version of the pitch that aimed to enhance clarity, engagement, and impact. The revised pitch emphasized the risks involved in the transition, the need for social justice, and the intersection of three global challenges: the climate challenge, the technology challenge, and the education challenge. The assistant also suggested the formation of a Laboratory for the Just Green Transition, a cross-departmental research lab focused on tangible projects and integrated plans. The lab's initial projects would involve identifying lost fossil fuel jobs and necessary skills, ultimately positioning the University of Delaware (UD) as a leader in planning for a sustainable future.
