James seeks assistance in refining and polishing a two-minute verbal pitch for a new project that focuses on the challenges and importance of a socially just green transition. Arachne provides a revised version of the pitch that enhances clarity, engagement, and impact. The revised pitch emphasizes the risk and disruption associated with the transition to clean energy, the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the establishment of a Laboratory for the Just Green Transition at UD. The goal is to position UD as a leader in planning for a sustainable future.
