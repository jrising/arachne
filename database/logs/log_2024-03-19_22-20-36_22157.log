James inquired about the differences between Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), understanding that GSA is more appropriate for complex, nonlinear models. Subsequently, he sought guidance on conducting GSA in R, where I recommended using the "sensitivity" package for estimating Sobol' indices. I outlined the steps: installing the package, defining the model, creating the input space, running the analysis, interpreting the results, and visualizing them. By following these steps and customizing the approach as needed, James can effectively perform GSA on his models in R for a deeper understanding of input parameter impacts on model outputs.
