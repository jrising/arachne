The discussion revolves around a comprehensive corporate stewardship plan aimed at enhancing relationships with the board, funders, and key individuals. The approach includes personalized quarterly check-ins, bi-annual in-person meetings, and frequent updates on organizational progress. A detailed stewardship calendar for 2025 outlines specific actions such as sending thank you notes in January, hosting appreciation events in April, and soliciting feedback in June. September focuses on preparations for Climate Week and conducting an annual meeting, while November includes expressions of gratitude and sharing end-of-year impact reports. Additional ideas include hosting parlor meetings, breakfast gatherings in major cities, and a quarterly newsletter. The next step is for Johanna to integrate these goals into Asana and coordinate with Comms calendars.
