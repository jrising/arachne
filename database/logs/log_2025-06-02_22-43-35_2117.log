The user reported an error related to the event loop being closed when using Pyppeteer, specifically during the shutdown process. The provided solution involved ensuring proper shutdown of the event loop and explicitly awaiting coroutines. The user shared their setup, which involved running a browser multiple times in a loop and using `asyncio.run()`, which led to the error occurring after a "break" command returned from a helper function. After reorganizing their code, they encountered a new `PageError`, indicating that they attempted to close a page that was already closed. The recommended approach was to check if a page was closed before invoking the close command, along with proper error handling to mitigate such issues during asynchronous operations.
