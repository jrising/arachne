James discussed the challenges of handling a long-tailed distribution where the mean is difficult to interpret due to extreme values. He provided relevant statistics showing different quantiles of his data. In response, I suggested a tailored approach for deciding how far to trim the tails. This included focusing on quantile-based trimming (specifically, at the 1% and 99% quantiles), considering the context of the analysis, conducting a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of results, and consulting existing literature for consistency with established practices. I emphasized that an initial trimming strategy at 1% and 99% could enhance interpretability while retaining meaningful data.
