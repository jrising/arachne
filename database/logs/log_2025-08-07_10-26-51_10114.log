James requested guidance on overlaying a pattern of slashes onto specific regions of a map of colored polygons in `ggplot2`. I recommended using the `ggpattern` package for applying diagonal stripes to the subset of polygons. We also discussed enhancing the labels to indicate uncertainty in areas with stripes, suggesting options such as annotation, conditional labels, and an explanatory legend. James then clarified the implementation details of the stripes and inquired about the appearance of black outlines on half-transparent stripes. I advised setting `pattern_color=NA` within the `geom_polygon_pattern` function to eliminate the unwanted outlines, ensuring a cleaner visualization.
