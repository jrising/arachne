In a previous conversation, James asked what TTL value to use when setting up a DNS record in Google Domains. The assistant explained that the TTL value determines how long the record should be cached by systems before requesting a fresh copy. While the ideal TTL value can vary, a common practice is to set it to around 1 hour (3600 seconds). The assistant provided step-by-step instructions on how to set the TTL in Google Domains. It mentioned that lower TTLs can help avoid downtime when changing hosts or servers but may result in more DNS lookup traffic, while higher TTLs reduce DNS lookup traffic but could lead to longer downtimes during changes.
