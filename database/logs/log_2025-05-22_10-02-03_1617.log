The discussion revolved around finding an appropriate name for a Zoom meeting related to the FFD4 Resilience Event. Participants acknowledged that while FFD4 references an important conference, it did not encapsulate the meeting's focus on climate resilience and adaptation. James Rising prompted the conversations about existing reports and ongoing efforts. Suggestions for a new meeting name included "Resilience Strategies for Climate Adaptation" and "Financial Resilience and Climate Adaptation Discussion." The emphasis was on creating a name that reflects the call's collaborative nature and aims. Ultimately, the goal is to align the meeting's title with its objectives related to climate impact and policy adaptation.
