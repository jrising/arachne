James sought assistance in his TTS app development, specifically regarding the use of the `Thread.join()` command and the issue of skipping sentences during playback. Arachne advised James that the `Thread.join()` command would not work in his case as the consumer thread had an infinite loop. Instead, Arachne suggested implementing a "poison pill" termination signal that would break the loop when a unique value (such as `None`) was added to the queue. Arachne then addressed the skipping issue by proposing the introduction of a small delay between each sentence playback using the `time.sleep()` function. James was provided with code examples and encouraged to adjust the delay duration to optimize the playback experience.
