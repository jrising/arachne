James inquired about estimating standard deviation from the mean and quantile values. I outlined a method assuming a normal distribution, detailing how to use the interquartile range (IQR) or a single quantile (e.g., the 95th percentile). I provided an R function to facilitate this computation. James then requested adjustments to the function, allowing him to input both quantile values and their corresponding percentages instead of assuming known quantile percentages. I updated the R function to accept a list of quantiles with their respective values and percentages, allowing calculation of standard deviation using either two quantiles to find the IQR or one quantile for direct estimation.
