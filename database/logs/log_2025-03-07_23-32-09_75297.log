James reported an issue with the `window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()` function returning an empty array when executed in a script, while the console displayed around 200 voices. I explained that this behavior is typical due to the asynchronous loading of voice data in browsers. The solution involves using the `voiceschanged` event listener to ensure the voice list is properly updated before accessing it. I provided a code snippet that defines a function to load voices and sets up the event listener, ensuring that the voice list is accessible both in the script and console.
