James asked how to wrap HTML returned by an AJAX request in a `ul` tag and append it to an element using jQuery. Arachne provided a code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this. The code uses the `$.ajax` function to make the AJAX request and retrieve the HTML. Then, it wraps the HTML in a `ul` tag using the `html` method and appends it to the specified element using the `append` method. James can replace `'endpoint-url'` with the URL of his AJAX endpoint and `'#elementId'` with the jQuery selector for the target element.
