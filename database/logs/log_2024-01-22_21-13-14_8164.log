This conversation with James focused on discussing the health consequences of malnutrition and exploring various biometric indicators used to measure them. James asked about additional biometrics beyond wasting, and Arachne provided a comprehensive list of commonly used indicators. These included underweight, stunting, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC), edema, haemoglobin levels, biochemical indicators, and body mass index (BMI). Arachne emphasized that these indicators should not be used in isolation and highlighted the importance of considering factors such as age, sex, and existing health conditions when conducting a comprehensive assessment.
