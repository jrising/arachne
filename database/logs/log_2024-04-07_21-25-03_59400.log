James requested assistance in creating a Python wrapper class to log method calls and property accesses for an internal object. I provided a detailed solution using `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` magic methods within the `Wrapper` class. The example demonstrated how to implement the wrapper to log calls made to the inner object. James was able to use this solution to create a wrapper class that logs function calls and property accesses when wrapping an object, enabling detailed tracking of interactions with the internal object.
