James inquired about the income elasticity of a policy cost, seeking to understand how policy expenses change in relation to income levels. Arachne explained that income elasticity measures the rate at which policy costs adjust with income variations, offering a formula for calculation and insights on its implications. An increase in income could either decrease (positive elasticity) or amplify (negative elasticity) the relative burden of policy costs. This exchange aimed to clarify the financial implications of policy decisions on diverse income groups.
