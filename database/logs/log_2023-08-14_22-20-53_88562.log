This chapter summarizes the concept of Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) and its relevance in addressing global sustainability challenges. The increasing scope and intensity of human-nature interactions since the Industrial Revolution have led to vulnerabilities in both human and natural systems, crossing planetary boundaries. Traditional views of conquering and freely using nature have proven unsustainable. Sustainable development, though widely accepted as a concept, has lagged in practical implementation due to limited understanding of the complex relationships between humans and nature. The CHANS framework addresses this knowledge gap by conceptualizing human and natural components as interacting and influencing each other. The chapter provides an example of a rural forest setting to illustrate the CHANS concept and concludes with the potential applications of this framework in understanding and developing more sustainable practices in various coupled human and natural systems.
