This chapter discusses the concept of Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) and its importance in addressing global sustainability challenges. It explores the increase in human-nature interactions since the Industrial Revolution, the vulnerability of both human and natural systems, and the limitations of traditional human-centered views. The chapter introduces the CHANS framework, emphasizing reciprocal interactions and feedbacks, and provides an example of a rural forest setting to illustrate how the components of a coupled system interact. It concludes by highlighting the potential application of the CHANS framework to various specific types of coupled human and natural systems.
