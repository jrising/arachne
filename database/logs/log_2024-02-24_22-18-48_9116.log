James inquired about various global models' representation of income distribution within regions. Arachne provided insights on eight models: AIM, E3ME, GEM-E3, Imaclim, NICE, ReMIND, WITCH, and RICE50+. She explained that while E3ME includes income distribution by household categories, the other models generally do not offer specific regional income distribution representations. Arachne noted that variations might exist in specific studies and highlighted the dynamic nature of model development.
