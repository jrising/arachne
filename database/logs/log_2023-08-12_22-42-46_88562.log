James asked for a recommendation on Python packages for building a keyword document search. The main requirements included extracting keywords from documents, storing the index on the hard drive, adding new documents to the index, and the ability to search for similar documents. The assistant suggested three Python packages: Whoosh, Elasticsearch, and Gensim. Whoosh is a pure Python library for full-text indexing and searching that supports storing the index on disk. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene, capable of handling large volumes of data quickly. Gensim, while not a full-fledged document indexing system, excels in finding similar documents through unsupervised semantic modeling. The assistant recommended combining Gensim for finding similar documents and Whoosh for document indexing as a potential robust solution.
