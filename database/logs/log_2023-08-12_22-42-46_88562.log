James wants to build a keyword document search in Python. He has several requirements including extracting keywords, storing the index on the hard drive, adding new documents frequently, and searching for similar documents. Arachne suggests three Python packages that can meet these requirements: Whoosh, Elasticsearch, and Gensim. Whoosh is a full-text indexing and searching library with support for document indexing and keyword extraction. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine that can store, search, and analyze large volumes of data in real-time. Gensim is particularly powerful for finding similar documents and extracting keywords. Arachne recommends considering a combination of Gensim and Whoosh for a robust solution.
