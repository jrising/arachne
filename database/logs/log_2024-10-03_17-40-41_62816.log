Daina Maliat expressed interest in applying for the Master of Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program at the University of Delaware, highlighting her background in environmental management and relevant research. Dr. James Rising acknowledged her qualifications but noted that funding is limited for the ESM program and advised her to apply early for financial aid consideration. Daina inquired about a possible Zoom meeting to discuss her application further, but Dr. Rising indicated it wouldn't impact funding. He recommended mentioning his research in her statement of purpose and applying by January 1 for full funding consideration. Subsequently, Daina sought clarification on application deadlines, funding opportunities for Environmental Economics, and updated a letter of recommendation. Ultimately, she was accepted into the ESM program but was informed by Dr. Rising that he had no funding available. Daina then requested information on potential funding for Spring/Fall 2025.
