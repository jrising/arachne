In response to James' report on data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay activities, the discussion involves expanding the section on Tribal Activities to include state-recognized tribes like the Lenape Indian Tribe of Delaware and the Nanticoke Indian Tribe, as well as federally recognized tribes originating from Delaware but now located elsewhere. The addition highlights the Nanticoke Indian Museum, the broader heritage represented by federal tribes, and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive research and data transparency. Trice et al. (2021) stress the need for updated information on Tribal Protected Areas and National Historic Preservation Act data to recognize and protect Native American communities' rights and cultural sites effectively. The revision aims to create a more thorough and inclusive depiction of Delaware's indigenous heritage for enhanced spatial planning and community collaboration.
