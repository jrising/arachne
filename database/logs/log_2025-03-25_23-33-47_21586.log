The conversation centers on a paper exploring the significance of sustainable marine spatial planning (MSP) as ocean-based industries escalate. James shares the abstract outlining the examination of data gaps in integrated MSP efforts along the Delaware coast, which evaluates 299 marine datasets. He seeks assistance in identifying the target audience for a related talk. The response highlights that the intended audience includes policymakers, marine spatial planners, coastal managers, researchers, and stakeholders in ocean-based industries. It underscores the benefits of attending for each group, emphasizing that insights into data gaps and interdependencies will facilitate collaborative approaches to enhance MSP effectiveness.
