This conversation focused on the usage of the `return` statement in JavaScript. The user asked when it is necessary to use `return` and if the last statement is always returned. Arachne explained that the `return` statement ends function execution and returns a value to the caller function. It is necessary when you want to pass the result of an operation back to the place where the function was called. Arachne provided examples to illustrate this, showing how the `return` statement can be used to send a value back to the caller function. It was also mentioned that if a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it will return `undefined` by default. Therefore, the last statement in a function is not always returned unless it is followed by a `return` keyword. It was emphasized that the `return` statement should be used when you want a function to produce a result that can be used elsewhere in your code.
