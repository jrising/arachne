James Rising discussed creating a smart form for prospective applicants to environmental policy programs at UD. The aim was to streamline communication by structuring responses to guide applicants based on their interests (social vs. natural sciences) and program specifics (e.g., Marine Policy, Environmental Economics). Key elements included identifying the right path for applicants, checking quantitative skills, understanding funding limitations, and categorizing research interests for Ph.D. candidates. I provided a comprehensive structure for the Google Form, incorporating multiple-choice questions, conditional logic, and sections for key messages about each program's requirements. Ultimately, the form aimed to facilitate efficient candidate evaluation while ensuring clarity about funding and program specifics.
