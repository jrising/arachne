In a discussion on October 2, 2023, James sought help in Julia for taking the mean of a vector containing both `Missing` and `NaN` values. I suggested using the `Statistics.mean` function along with `skipmissing` and `filter` for proper handling. However, James encountered a `TypeError` due to the misuse of `isnan` with `Missing` values. I then provided a refined solution that filters out both `Missing` and `NaN` by checking the type of each element before computing the mean, ensuring that the code avoids errors and achieves the desired outcome.
