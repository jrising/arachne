The methodology for estimating the macroeconomic effects of climate change consists of a thorough review of scientific literature, utilization of various models, a machine learning approach, and modeling of indirect effects. Key insights from scientific papers include vulnerabilities of less affluent countries and potential adaptation. Models are evaluated based on criteria such as data quality and methodology sophistication. High-quality weather and economic data are used to estimate the models objectively. Figure 1 visually represents the comparison of models. A machine learning approach is employed to integrate model contributions and assign quality values. Rippling effects through international trade are considered using parallels to events like Brexit. A capital dynamics model captures human, produced, and renewable capital. Uncertainty is represented through Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of potential economic costs due to climate change, with appendices providing more detailed descriptions of the processes and methodologies.
