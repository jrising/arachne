James requested assistance in creating a paper section explaining code principles for determining species home ranges. The code involved data integration, cleaning, handling missing values, and a linear model for prediction. I provided a detailed overview of the method, including steps for data integration, handling missing data through imputation strategies, and using taxonomic hierarchies for species-specific gaps. Diagnostic checks and transformations were explained, leading to the development of a linear model for home range prediction. The method emphasized robustness in data handling and prediction accuracy, enabling informed ecological decisions.
