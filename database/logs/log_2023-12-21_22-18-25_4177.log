In a conversation with James, he asked if it was possible to construct a map of an area around a latitude/longitude point in Python without using QGIS. Arachne provided a solution using the geopandas and matplotlib libraries. James encountered an error with the aspect ratio calculation, and Arachne suggested manually setting the aspect ratio. However, James mentioned that the error occurred on the plotting line itself, indicating another issue. Arachne then troubleshooted by checking the CRS and geometry validity. James received a warning about CRS mismatch and a suggestion to reproject the point. After resolving an error in setting up the GeoDataFrame, James still encountered an issue where the map displayed the whole world. Arachne explained the warning about geographic CRS and recommended projecting the point to a suitable CRS before buffering.
