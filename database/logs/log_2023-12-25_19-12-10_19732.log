James asked for the cheapest way for a family of two parents, a 3-year-old, and a 1-year-old to visit Disneyland. Arachne provided several money-saving tips, including booking tickets in advance, traveling in the off-season, considering lodging outside the resort, packing meals, limiting souvenirs, and utilizing Disney credit card or membership clubs for discounts. Arachne also mentioned that children under 3 enter for free, so the 1-year-old wouldn't require a ticket. The main point emphasized was that having a fun experience at Disneyland is not just about buying everything, but about enjoying the atmosphere, attractions, and each other's company.
