The discussion centered around the cost of civilization as estimated by the PAGE integrated assessment model. The $53 quadrillion value is likely derived using various factor inputs, including population growth, GDP per capita, discount rate, damage function, and projections for global temperature increase. The value represents an estimate of expected future global GDP. Other research informs these estimates through other integrated assessment models such as DICE and FUND, but it's important to note the inherent uncertainty and controversy surrounding these models.
