In the previous conversation, James asked about the basis for the "$53 quadrillion" statistical cost of civilization in the PAGE integrated assessment model. The assistant explained that this value is likely derived from an economic calculation using the PAGE model, which is an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) that combines economics and climate science. The assistant listed the inputs used by IAMs to calculate the cost of civilization. It emphasized that the $53 quadrillion figure is an estimate of expected future global GDP, using a typical discount rate. The assistant also mentioned other IAMs like DICE and FUND, which use different methodologies and assumptions, leading to a range of valuations. It noted that IAMs are subject to controversy and uncertainty but provide a starting point for discussions on the economic impacts of climate change.
