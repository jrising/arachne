James sought guidance on calculating a covariance matrix across countries using a data frame of annual values in R. I advised him to organize the data so that each country's annual values are columns and each year as rows. The process involves using the `pivot_wider()` function from the `tidyverse` package to restructure the data, followed by the `cov()` function to calculate the covariance matrix while handling missing values with `use = "pairwise.complete.obs"`. I emphasized the importance of removing non-numeric columns before calculation and provided a code example to illustrate the process.
