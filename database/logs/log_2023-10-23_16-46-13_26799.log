In a previous conversation, James asked if there was a term for someone with a Ph.D. other than "Doctor," which sounds more like a medical doctor. Arachne explained that people with Ph.D. degrees are commonly referred to as "Doctor" in academic, professional, and formal contexts. Arachne also suggested alternatives such as "Scholar" or "Academic," and mentioned that specifying "Ph.D." after their name, or using "Doctor of Philosophy" (the full term for Ph.D.), are also options. However, Arachne emphasized that personal preferences and cultural norms may vary, so it's best to ask the individual how they prefer to be addressed.
