James sought a method to create a hash string based on a file's content in Python for caching purposes. Arachne recommended using the `hashlib` module with SHA256 for hashing the binary content. She provided a code snippet demonstrating how to generate a unique hash value for a file, enabling James to avoid processing duplicate files by comparing their hash values rather than filenames.
