In a previous conversation, James asked about a term for dropping a certain percentage of values from the extremes of a dataset. I informed him that the term he was looking for is "Winsorizing." Winsorizing involves replacing extreme values with less extreme values, reducing the impact of outliers on statistical analyses. However, I cautioned James to use Winsorizing judiciously as it can distort original values, and to be transparent about its use when reporting results.
