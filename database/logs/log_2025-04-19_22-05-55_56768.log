James inquired about academic papers estimating implicit friction costs related to the "energy efficiency paradox," which describes why consumers often do not adopt energy-efficient technologies despite apparent economic benefits. I provided several relevant papers: 

1. **Gillingham & Palmer (2014)**, which reviews economic theories and empirical evidence concerning the energy efficiency gap, including behavioral factors.
2. **Allcott & Greenstone (2012)**, which examines potential explanations for the gap, focusing on implicit costs.
3. **Brown & Wang (2015)**, discussing barriers to energy efficiency adoption, including implicit friction costs.

These studies highlight the theoretical and empirical factors limiting optimal energy-efficient technology uptake. I also offered to help find access to these papers if needed.
