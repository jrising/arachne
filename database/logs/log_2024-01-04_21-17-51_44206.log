Ebenezer Oduro expressed interest in pursuing a master's degree in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. His email showcased his strong background in economics and his enthusiasm for researching climate change risks, financial opportunities, and mitigation strategies. He specifically mentioned his desire to work with James and contribute to his research on climate change impacts using integrated assessment modeling. Based on the email, Ebenezer's interests align with the Masters in Environmental Economics or potentially the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics programs. However, funding constraints exist for both programs. The suggested response emphasized the self-funded nature of the EE Masters program and encouraged Ebenezer to mention his alignment with James' research in his statement of purpose. The response also highlighted the need to apply early to be considered for any available funds.
