The conversation focused on the assessment of the global energy sector's emissions trajectory within the context of the UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment project. Key points included an examination of twelve energy sector indicators to evaluate decarbonization progress and future energy consumption. Historical time series data were compared with International Energy Agency scenarios to forecast emissions from 2020 to 2040, highlighting gradual emissions rises until the late 2020s, followed by a slow decline. The assessment indicated that emissions would reach approximately 35 gigatonnes by 2040 and just under 25 gigatonnes by the end of the century, primarily tracking RCP4.5, while remaining significantly lower than RCP8.5. The session concluded with a reference to the collaboration's report by the Committee on Climate Change and insights from Chatham House.
