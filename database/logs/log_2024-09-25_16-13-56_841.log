In the discussion, James asked about "one night stand protocol." I responded with guidelines covering safety, clear communication, consideration of feelings, privacy, graceful departure, and the importance of sobriety. The recommendations emphasized mutual consent, respect for boundaries, and maintaining the dignity of all parties involved. Each guideline aligns with the overarching theme of responsible and considerate conduct in casual intimate encounters.
