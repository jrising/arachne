James sought assistance with "multi-level logistic regression modeling" in R, specifically to analyze a scenario where respondents choose sell amounts based on prices. He compared two approaches: a teacher's method treating each sell amount as a separate observation and his proper method regressing sell amounts directly against prices. Arachne provided R code to simulate data, set up a multi-level logistic regression using the `lme4` package, and compare standard errors from both approaches. After James clarified that his model should not include binary choices but rather directly regress sell amounts against prices, Arachne adjusted the R code accordingly, ensuring clarity in the modeling approach and emphasizing standard error comparison. The discussion aimed to highlight potential issues with the student's method and validate the proper approach.
