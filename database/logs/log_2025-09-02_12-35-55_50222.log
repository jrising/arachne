James inquired about how to perform linear interpolation from a set of points (year and "delay") in Julia. I guided him through the process using the `Interpolations.jl` package. The steps included installing the package, importing it, defining the data points into vectors, creating a linear interpolation object using `LinearInterpolation`, and utilizing the interpolation function to obtain interpolated values for any specified year. I also provided a complete code example demonstrating these steps. The discussion focused on practical implementation, with an offer for further clarification on any additional requirements or edge cases.
