The discussion involved James requesting a description of the principles behind a code implementing fish flow estimation. The AI assistant provided a concise outline detailing data input, processing steps, spawning region aggregation, catch prediction model, parameter estimation using NNLS, incorporation of priors, and metrics calculation. The method combines species, catch, and spawning region data to estimate recruitment contributions through NNLS regression, ensuring ecologically consistent and non-negative predictions. The discussion aimed to clarify the methodology and principles underpinning the fish flow estimation process for scientific paper supplementary information.
