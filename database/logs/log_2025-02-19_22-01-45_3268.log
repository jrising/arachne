The discussion focused on supporting students in a capstone project aimed at developing best practices for community engagement in Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR) research, commissioned by NOAA Research. The conversation included a review of co-production literature, which emphasized the importance of participatory approaches in climate research. The synthesis identified key papers, summarizing their contributions to understanding co-creation principles, stakeholder involvement, equitable practices, and iterative processes. A table was constructed to map contexts, engagement objectives, principles identified, and references, providing a framework for the students to develop their database of best practices. This structured approach highlights the significance of inclusivity, transparency, and respect for diverse community concerns in mCDR activities.
