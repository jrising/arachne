In the previous discussion on 2023-05-03, James inquired about summarizing every column in the same way using the `dplyr` package in R. I responded by explaining how to use the `summarize(across(...))` function to apply a summary function across all columns in a dataframe. I provided an example, demonstrating how to calculate the mean for each column while excluding `NA` values, and mentioned that other summary functions like `sum` or `median` could also be used. This allowed James to effectively summarize data in a consistent manner across multiple columns.
