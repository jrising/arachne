James sought to combine an annual data dataframe (`projected`) with a country-level coefficients dataframe (`pattern`) to obtain country-by-year results in R. He described his traditional method involving a loop and `rbind` but expressed concerns regarding efficiency. I suggested using `dplyr` for a more efficient approach. Using `crossing`, the combination of the two dataframes was created, followed by a `mutate` function to calculate `rtl_landtemp`. The `select` function helped arrange the resulting dataset to include relevant columns (ISO, Year, rtl_landtemp), emphasizing that this method benefits from vectorized operations, improving performance and readability.
