In the conversation, James asked if a sailing ship can travel upwind using tacking and requested an expression for calculating the ship's speed relative to the wind's direction. Arachne confirmed that sailing ships can indeed travel upwind using tacking and provided a simplified approach for calculating the ship's speed. The approach involved breaking down the ship's speed into two components: the speed directly upwind and the speed across the wind. Arachne explained that the ship's effective speed directly upwind is equal to the network speed of the ship multiplied by the cosine of the angle the ship makes with the direction against the wind. Arachne also noted that the estimated effective speed can be roughly 70% of the network speed, assuming a 45-degree angle for best efficiency. Arachne mentioned that the model doesn't account for various real-world factors that can affect the ship's speed when tacking.
