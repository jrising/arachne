In a discussion with James, he asked about the term for negative growth in a logistic growth function when the population (or stock) exceeds its carrying capacity. The assistant explained that this is referred to as "density-dependent regulation" or "density-dependent mortality." It occurs when resources become limited and competition intensifies, leading to slower growth rates or even negative growth. The assistant also mentioned that this concept is commonly used in ecology and is represented in the logistic growth model by the term (1 - S/K), where S is the population density and K is the carrying capacity.
