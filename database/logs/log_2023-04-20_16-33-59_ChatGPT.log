In a previous conversation, James asked if it is possible to add a new variable to an xarray.Dataset. The assistant responded that it is indeed possible by using the syntax `ds["name"] = x`, where `ds` is the Dataset, `"name"` is the key (variable name), and `x` is the appropriately dimensioned DataArray. The assistant provided an example code snippet to illustrate the process. After executing the code, the Dataset will contain the new variable with the specified key and values from the DataArray.
