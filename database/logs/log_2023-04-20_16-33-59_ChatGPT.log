The user asked if they could add a new variable to an xarray Dataset, and the assistant confirmed that it is possible by using the syntax `ds["name"] = x`, where "name" is the key (variable name) and `x` is the appropriately dimensioned DataArray. The assistant provided a code example and explained how the new variable would be added to the Dataset.
