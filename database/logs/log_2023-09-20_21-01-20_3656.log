In a previous conversation, James asked how to compare text files in Linux/Mac OS under specific conditions, including different line endings and ignoring differences between a return character and a space. Arachne suggested using the `diff` command with the `-b` option, which ignores changes in whitespace. The command `diff -b base.txt modified.txt` compares the two files and highlights the differences. Arachne also provided an alternative command, `diff -b --unified base.txt modified.txt`, which displays the entire content of both files and highlights the differences in a unified diff format.
