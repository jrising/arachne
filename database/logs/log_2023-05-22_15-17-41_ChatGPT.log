In the discussion, James asks about the best global climate model and the most complete representation of climate processes. Arachne explains that there isn't a single "best" model as it depends on the specific aspect of the climate system being studied. Arachne mentions several global climate models, such as CESM, HadGEM, and GISS ModelE, and highlights that each model has strengths and weaknesses. Arachne also mentions the use of ensemble models to capture a range of possible outcomes and estimate uncertainty. In regards to the most complete representation of climate processes, Arachne explains that all GCMs make approximations and simplifications based on our current understanding and computational limitations. Arachne mentions the CESM as an example of a model with a comprehensive representation of different Earth system components. She also emphasizes the importance of using multiple models to account for limitations and uncertainties.
