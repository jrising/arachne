This grant proposal aims to investigate how climate change affects food production and human health, focusing on vulnerable populations in West Africa. The proposed project includes several Work Packages (WPs) to address different aspects of the research plan and the impact, engagement, and dissemination plan. 

WP1, led by NASRDA, will map and analyze climate change impacts on agriculture, focusing on small-holder farmers and food security. WP2, led by CRODT and IMR, will examine the effects of climate change on fisheries, considering ocean warming, acidification, and habitat degradation. UD will lead WP3 on bioeconomic modeling, integrating sustainability and economic aspects to guide adaptation practices in agriculture and fisheries. UD will also lead WP4 on health evaluation and risk analysis, assessing the impact of food scarcity, nutrient deficiency, and poisoning risks on human health.

In the Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan, WP5, led by CRODT, BAPDP, and ITA, will engage with stakeholders to develop tools like the Food Security Futures Explorer. UD will lead WP6 on capacity-building and knowledge sharing, fostering collaboration and data management. UD and NASRDA will lead WP7 on dissemination and policy influencing, targeting policymakers and practitioners.

These WPs ensure collaboration among institutions and stakeholder involvement throughout the project, aligning with the interdisciplinary approach and emphasizing the importance of resilience to production, nutrition, and health risks.
