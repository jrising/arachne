In a previous conversation, James requested the country names for a list of ISO codes. The assistant provided the requested information, and James then asked for the results in a specific format, including population estimates, GDP figures, and whether the countries are land-locked or coastal. The assistant promptly provided the revised information in the specified format, including the requested details. The assistant also included a note highlighting that the population and GDP figures are estimates and can vary.
