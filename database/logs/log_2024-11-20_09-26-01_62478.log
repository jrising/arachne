James requested assistance in drafting a response to an email from Miriam Crispe, who inquired about supervising graduate students in various marine and environmental programs. Key points he wanted to include were the transition of the Masters in Marine Policy to the new Environmental Science & Management (ESM) program, which features a Marine track, as well as insights on the Ph.D. programs and funding details. The goal was to direct Miriam to a form for prospective students to assess which program best suits them. My response included a brief outline of the ESM program, a reminder for Miriam to complete the form, and an invitation to follow up with further questions after reviewing the program details.
