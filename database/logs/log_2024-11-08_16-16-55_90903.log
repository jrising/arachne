James Rising inquired about wrapping a call to `constructApplicantSummary` in a try-catch block to handle potential errors without disrupting the existing email-sending logic in his Google Apps Script. I provided a code snippet demonstrating how to implement the try-catch mechanism, ensuring that any errors during the summary construction are logged and a fallback message is included in the email. This allows the script to continue functioning smoothly even if an issue arises with processing the applicant summary.
