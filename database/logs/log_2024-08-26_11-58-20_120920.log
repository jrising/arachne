In a discussion about communication skills at the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), I highlighted my ability to tailor messages for different audiences. Key examples included leading outreach on commercial building energy efficiency where I addressed owners' concerns, synthesizing complex research findings into accessible presentations for varied stakeholders, advocating for improved building energy standards through targeted communication with policymakers, and participating in webinars where I effectively conveyed intricate concepts to diverse audiences. Overall, I emphasized how my experiences at IMT showcase my understanding of audience needs and my skill in making complex topics clear and relevant.
