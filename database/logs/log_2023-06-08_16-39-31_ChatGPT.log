In the previous conversation, James asked whether it is more typical to write "reduced form specification" or "reduced-form specification" in econometrics. The assistant explained that it is more grammatically correct and standard to use the hyphenated version "reduced-form specification." This is because "reduced-form" is a compound adjective modifying "specification," and using a hyphen in compound adjectives before the noun they modify helps to avoid potential ambiguity. Therefore, "reduced-form specification" is the preferred way to write this term in academic and professional writing.
