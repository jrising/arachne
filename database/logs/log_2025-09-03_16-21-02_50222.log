In the conversation, James inquired about the meaning of "EA (excl. CN/JP)," which refers to East Asia excluding China and Japan. I explained that it typically includes South Korea, North Korea, Mongolia, and Taiwan. He then requested a list of corresponding ISO alpha-2 codes, which I provided: KR (South Korea), KP (North Korea), MN (Mongolia), TW (Taiwan). Finally, James asked for the ISO alpha-3 codes, which I supplied as KOR (South Korea), PRK (North Korea), MNG (Mongolia), and TWN (Taiwan). The discussion culminated in a clear understanding of country codes for the specified region.
