In a previous conversation, James inquired about function arguments in Julia. I suggested using `::Function` for type annotations, but noted its broadness and advised on the flexibility of accepting functions without type restrictions. He then asked about a more general `Callable` type. I clarified that while `Callable` isn't a built-in type, `AbstractFunction` could theoretically work, prompting him to explore alternatives. Upon his realization that `AbstractFunction` was undefined, I recommended sticking with `Function` or creating a `CallableWrapper` struct to encapsulate callable objects. Conclusively, I emphasized choosing based on specific use cases while ensuring type safety when applicable.
