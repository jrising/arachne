James asked how to convert hours since 1900-01-01 to a date-time in R. Arachne instructed him to use the `as.POSIXct()` function and provided a code example. James needed to convert the hours to seconds, add them to the origin date, define the origin date as "1900-01-01" in UTC, and print the resulting date-time object.
