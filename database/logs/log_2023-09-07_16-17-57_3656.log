James Rising's research statement focuses on the interdisciplinary study of climate impacts and the water-energy-food system. His work aims to understand and manage complex social-environmental systems under global environmental change, contributing to economic and environmental sustainability. James bridges gaps between climate science, biophysical modeling, and climate economics, with collaborations under the Climate Impact Lab (CIL) to quantify climate risks. He developed the analytical engine for the American Climate Prospectus (ACP), improving assessments of climate vulnerability and adaptation costs across multiple sectors. James also develops online tools and public resources for climate impact analysis. His research explores the complexity of human-environment interactions, addressing issues like cross-boundary flows and climate inequality. Within the water-energy-food system, James developed the AWASH model, providing insights into water stress and improved management strategies. He is a lead contributor to integrated assessment modeling (BC-IAM), particularly the PAGE model, and expands the model to study inequality and national adaptation. James' immediate research plans involve further [information missing].
