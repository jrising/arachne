In a previous conversation with James, he asked how to replace all NA values with 0 in an R dataframe. Arachne provided two solutions: using the `replace_na()` function from the `tidyverse` package or using the `is.na()` function in base R. Arachne provided code examples for both approaches. In the base R example, `is.na(df)` generates a Boolean matrix where each NA value is represented as TRUE, and `<- 0` replaces these TRUE values (the NAs) with 0.
