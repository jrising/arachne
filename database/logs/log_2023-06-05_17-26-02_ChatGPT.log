In this fable, a half-tamed mountain bear and an old garden lover meet in a forest. Both longing for companionship, they become friends and enjoy each other's company. The bear, skilled at swatting flies, keeps his friend's face free from pests. However, one day, while trying to swat a fly on the man's nose, the bear accidentally kills him with a stone. The moral of the story is that having an ignorant friend can be dangerous, and it's better to have a wise enemy.
