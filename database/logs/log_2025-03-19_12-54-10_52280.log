This discussion focused on understanding how debt and deficit changes, as well as the risk of fiscal crises, emerge beyond the simple imbalance of tax revenue and government expenditures. Key factors included economic growth rates, interest rates, inflation, structural economic changes, external shocks, contingent liabilities, and monetary policy interactions. Additionally, it emphasized the importance of considering various macroeconomic variables, such as labor productivity, capital depreciation/loss, unemployment, public investment, trade balances, and business cycles, in a holistic analysis of fiscal health. Recognizing these dimensions can provide a more nuanced understanding of fiscal dynamics and their implications for adaptation and resilience investments.
