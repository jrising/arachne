The discussion involved James Rising's response to an email from Iftikhar Ahmed, a lecturer seeking admission to the University of Delaware's Ph.D. program under the US-Pakistan Knowledge Corridor Scholarship. Iftikhar highlighted his credentials and expressed urgency due to a May 5, 2025, deadline for his admission offer letter. James communicated that he would not be offering admission, noting that the admissions process was already complete for the year. He expressed willingness to discuss future opportunities if desired, suggesting a Zoom meeting via a provided link. The tone was maintained as professional and dispassionate throughout.
