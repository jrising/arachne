James inquired about the presence of an unexplained variance segment in Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The AI explained that GSA decomposes output variance based on input parameters using techniques like Sobol' indices, not accounting for unexplained variance explicitly. Unexplained variance is seen as residual error due to missing variables, unmodeled interactions, or high randomness. To assess this, James was advised to consider Residual Analysis, adjusting the model for better variance capture.
