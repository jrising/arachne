The theory of change posits that effective decision-making regarding climate-related risks hinges on high-quality, interconnected data and models. By synthesizing existing UK sector models into a macroeconomic framework, we can achieve a nuanced understanding of climate damages and adaptation benefits. The strategy to operationalize this consists of six key components: (1) Conducting a rapid synthesis of data on macroeconomic impacts; (2) Developing a robust macroeconomic modeling framework, such as NiGEM, to analyze various warming scenarios; (3) Establishing a collaborative network of experts to share best practices; (4) Ensuring transparent documentation of all processes and outputs; (5) Engaging with stakeholders to communicate findings and enhance policy relevance; and (6) Incorporating feedback mechanisms to integrate insights from ongoing research. This approach aims to inform resilient policy outcomes and effectively manage fiscal risks associated with climate change.
