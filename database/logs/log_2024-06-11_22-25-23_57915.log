James sought advice on fitting a loess model to data with a long-tailed distribution in the y-axis without losing zeros. Arachne suggested various approaches, including Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations, square root transformation, asymptotic adjustments, quantile regression, and winsorization. Arachne provided an example using the Yeo-Johnson transformation in R and emphasized choosing a method that suits the data characteristics and analysis goals. James was encouraged to seek further guidance if needed for implementation.
