The conversation started with a clarification about the meaning of "Output" in IMPLAN, explaining that it refers to the total value of production by an industry and not its profit. The discussion then moved to how industry costs are represented in IMPLAN and broke down the concept into intermediate inputs and value-added components. An example calculation was provided to illustrate how output is derived from these factors. The conversation then turned towards using components of value-added and final demand calculations to estimate total industry output, with a caution against double-counting. A different approach using the Input-Output (I-O) model was suggested. Finally, the key parameter in I-O modeling, the Regional Purchase Coefficient (RPC), was explained, and the meaning of MRIO (Multiregional Input-Output analysis) was provided.
