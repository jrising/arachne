During the conversation, James asked if the Huns invaded China, and Arachne provided information about the Xiongnu, a similar nomadic tribe, who invaded China during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. James then asked about Sesame Street songs about New York City, and Arachne initially provided songs that don't explicitly mention NYC. After James requested songs that specifically talk about things they love about the city, Arachne corrected her mistake and listed songs like "New York City Serenade," "Sing," and "The Adventure Song," which highlight the sights, sounds, and excitement of the city.
