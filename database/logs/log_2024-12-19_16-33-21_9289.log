In this blog post, we explore an important new study on the social cost of carbon (SCC) that reveals significant underestimations in existing literature. Our research synthesizes 1,823 SCC estimates from 147 studies, highlighting the critical role of model structural decisions beyond traditional focus areas like damage functions and discount rates. Expert insights gathered through surveys indicate that the current estimates are too low, prompting a recalibrated mean SCC of $283 per ton for 2020. The findings underscore the importance of comprehensive modeling to inform effective climate policy, advocating for more robust investment in renewable technologies and international agreements to combat climate change. The methodological innovations introduced in this research pave the way for improved accuracy in future estimates, crucial for making informed decisions that shape a sustainable future.
