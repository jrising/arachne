In a previous conversation, James asked how to calculate the standard error of the marginal effect in an econometric model. The assistant explained that the Delta method can be used to approximate the standard error of a function of estimated parameters. In the given model, the marginal effect is b1 + 2 b2 T. Using the Delta method, the assistant provided a formula to calculate the variance of the marginal effect. The formula involves the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter estimates, which needs to be known to find a numerical answer. The assistant also mentioned that statistical software packages like R or Stata have built-in routines for performing this calculation.
