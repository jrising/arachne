The section from the report on Marine Spatial Planning for wind energy discusses various resources and activities related to commercial fishing and offshore wind development in the mid-Atlantic area. Commercial fishing is an ongoing activity managed by the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council (MAFMC), covering a range of species. Fishing locations are identified using AIS, VMS, and VTR systems, with spatial extent concentrated around coastlines. Pelagic gear commercial fishing occurs near the coast and diminishes with depth, while benthic gear commercial fishing predominates and diminishes beyond the 60-meter contour line. Both types of fishing may face challenges and conflicts if wind turbine areas are developed. Offshore wind development is a potential activity, subject to decision-making. The Ocean SAMP, used in Rhode Island, engages fishing communities to identify important areas. Stakeholders include commercial fishermen, MAFMC, NOAA-NMFS, wind energy developers, and governmental bodies. The report suggests consultations to minimize conflicts and highlights confidentiality restrictions and limitations of VTR data.
