James inquired about creating gaps in a time series line plot using Plots.jl in Julia. I advised him to insert `NaN` values in the data at the desired positions to create gaps, as the plotting function automatically skips over `NaN` values. An example code snippet was provided to demonstrate this technique, emphasizing the manipulation of `NaN` values in the data to control where gaps appear in the plot.
