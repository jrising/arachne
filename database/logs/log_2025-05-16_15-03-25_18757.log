In this discussion, James seeks help with a Python script to bypass anti-scraping measures on websites requiring JavaScript and cookies. I suggested using headless browsers like Selenium or Pyppeteer, highlighting their effectiveness and speed. James mentions needing WebSocket support, prompting recommendations for using Selenium or Pyppeteer. He then inquires about efficiently managing multiple URL requests in Pyppeteer and the implications of not closing the browser. I advised launching the browser once and closing it after tasks to manage resources. Further, James asks about implementing timeouts and handling streaming data with Pyppeteer, which I explained. Lastly, he inquires about limiting download sizes, leading to a discussion about intercepting responses to manage content effectively.
