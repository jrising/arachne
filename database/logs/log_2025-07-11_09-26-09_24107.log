James inquired about resolving a redirection issue when accessing Nature.com, which was attributed to a non-functional proxy setup. After identifying it wasn't linked to system proxy settings, extensions, or the hosts file, I suggested several troubleshooting steps. These included clearing browser cache and cookies, checking site-specific permissions, resetting browser settings, and examining for any custom URL redirects. I provided detailed instructions for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox to assist James in diagnosing and resolving the issue effectively.
