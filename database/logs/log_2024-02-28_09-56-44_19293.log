James requested a paragraph from a grant proposal to be shortened and improved in flow. The original paragraph highlighted the challenges faced by Africa's agricultural sector due to climate change, emphasizing impacts on soil nutrients, productivity, and food availability. After editing, the revised paragraph succinctly conveys the threats posed by climate change to African agriculture, addressing workforce statistics, reliance on rainfed cropland, climatic shocks, and the potential yield reductions for staple crops with warming above 2Â°C.
