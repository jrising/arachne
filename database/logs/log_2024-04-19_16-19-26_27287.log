James requested assistance on building a Pandas DataFrame row by row in a loop, encountering an error due to a deprecated `append` method in Pandas. Arachne provided a code example using `pd.concat` instead of `append` to address the issue efficiently and explained the modifications made to adapt to newer Pandas versions. This enabled James to continue creating DataFrame rows successfully while avoiding the AttributeError.
