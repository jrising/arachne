The military use of the Delaware planning area involves two main zones: the VACAPES OPAREA near the shoreline and the Atlantic City OPAREA further out to sea. These areas serve as designated zones for national defense training exercises and system qualification tests, with well-defined boundaries established through national designations and international treaties. They allow for the coordination of defense activities among various government agencies and ensure public safety through mechanisms such as the Local Notice to Mariners. Additionally, south of Delaware's planning zone, a ship shock trial area exists, which was recently moved further offshore to create a 5 NM buffer from the Mid-Atlantic Planning Awareness Area (PAA) in order to minimize potential impacts on marine wildlife, in accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
