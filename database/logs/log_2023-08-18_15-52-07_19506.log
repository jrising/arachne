The military use of the Delaware planning area includes two primary zones: the VACAPES OPAREA near shore and the Atlantic City OPAREA further out to sea. These areas are designated for national defense training and system qualification tests. They allow for coordination with federal, state, and local agencies and the general public's involvement through the Local Notice to Mariners. Additionally, a ship shock trial area, recently shifted further out to sea, is situated south of the Delaware planning zone. This relocation was done to establish a 5 NM buffer between the ship shock trial area and the Mid-Atlantic Planning Awareness Area, minimizing potential impacts on marine wildlife.
