James inquired about the distinction between RMSE and standard deviation of errors (sd(error). The response highlighted that RMSE measures overall prediction error by considering bias and variance, while sd(error) focuses on the spread of errors around the mean. Key differences were explained, such as RMSE incorporating biases and using \( n \) observations, unlike sd(error) which uses \( n - 1 \). RMSE is commonly used for model evaluation, while sd(error) indicates error consistency and spread.
