James inquired about the "Land of Strange Adventures" from the "Death of Arthur." I explained that this term originates from Arthurian legend, particularly in Sir Thomas Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur." It refers to mystical realms encountered by knights like Sir Lancelot and Sir Galahad, where they face challenges that test their chivalry, engage in battles with mythical creatures, or meet enchantresses. These adventures serve as allegories for revealing the characters' virtues or flaws. I also offered to discuss a specific scene or knight if he had one in mind.
