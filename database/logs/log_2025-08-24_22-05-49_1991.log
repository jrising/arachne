James inquired about a non-repeating sequence that could be generated by a simple program. I suggested prime numbers as an example due to their infinite and non-repeating nature. I provided a Python program for generating the first ten prime numbers. James requested a simplified version in R that solely prints the primes found. I then offered an R implementation that defines a function to check for primes and prints each prime number as itâ€™s discovered, maintaining the focus on simplicity and clarity.
