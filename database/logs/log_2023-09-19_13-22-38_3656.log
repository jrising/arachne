James asked if it is possible to include values in a ggplot legend that do not show up in the data. Arachne responded that this can be achieved by using the `scale_*_manual()` function to manually define the legend labels and their associated colors or shapes. Arachne provided an example code snippet to demonstrate how this can be done. However, James encountered difficulties in seeing all the entries in the legend. Arachne acknowledged the limitation in ggplot, where the legend defaults to only including values present in the data. She suggested creating a separate data frame specifically for the legend labels and provided an updated example code snippet to illustrate this approach. The separate data frame contains the legend labels, and non-existent values are included using the `breaks` argument in the `scale_*_manual()` functions.
