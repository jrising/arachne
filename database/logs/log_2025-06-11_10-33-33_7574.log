James inquired about using `ggplot2` to create a `facet_wrap` with differing vertical space for panels based on the number of y-values in each. I recommended the `ggh4x` package and the `facet_wrap_custom()` function. We discussed how to install `ggh4x` and leverage the `scales` argument for variable height. Later, James corrected the approach to use `facet_manual()` for a more customized layout, sharing an example with heights specified. I provided guidance on constructing the design using grouped data to calculate panel heights, including a code example illustrating how to implement `facet_manual()` effectively. This discussion focused on achieving variable vertical spacing in ggplot faceting, improving plot customization.
