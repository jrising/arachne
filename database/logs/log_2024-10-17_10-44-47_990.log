James inquired about a dish listed on an Austrian menu: "Pumpkin vegetables with sheep cheese and pumpkin bag." I explained that the dish likely features roasted or saut√©ed pumpkin with other vegetables, common in Austrian cuisine. The "sheep cheese" probably refers to a type of cheese made from sheep's milk, such as feta or pecorino. The term "pumpkin bag" might be a mis-translation, possibly meaning a pumpkin seed roll or bread. In summary, the dish appears to be a flavorful combination of pumpkin, vegetables, sheep cheese, and a bread-like accompaniment.
