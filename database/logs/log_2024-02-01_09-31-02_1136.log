In a previous conversation, James asked about modifying a tree structure in R by recursively passing branches to a function. The AI explained that R uses a "copy-on-modify" behavior for function arguments, meaning that a copy of a variable is made only when it is modified within a function. The AI provided an example of a function that modifies a tree structure and explained how changes made within the function do not affect the original tree unless explicitly returned. The AI also advised James to be mindful of potential memory implications when working with large and complex data structures.
