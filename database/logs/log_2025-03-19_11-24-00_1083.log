In a previous conversation, James asked for a detailed account of Johanna Goetzel's extensive experience in the climate and environmental domain. I outlined her key roles, including her work with the Institute for Market Transformation, Clean Energy Buyers Association, and The Earth Institute, focusing on sustainable development, clean technology, and climate policy. Following this, James requested a cover letter for a Partnerships Manager position at Climate Policy Radar, a not-for-profit startup enhancing access to climate documents through AI. I crafted a tailored cover letter that highlighted qualifications, including successful partnership management, communication skills, and a strong alignment with CPR's mission and values.
