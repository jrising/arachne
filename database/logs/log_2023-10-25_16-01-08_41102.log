The IPCC AR6 report provides a range of evidence and confidence levels for various tipping points in the climate system. Key points include the already underway irreversible changes in slowly-responding processes like deep ocean overturning circulation and ice sheets, the existence of tipping points based on the paleoclimate record, and the potential for abrupt changes at regional scales. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) shows low confidence in recovery after stabilization, while irreversibility is substantiated in ocean acidification, ocean warming, sea level rise, and some cryosphere changes. The report suggests that the AMOC will weaken and recover over several centuries under various temperature stabilization scenarios. The Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are projected to be irreversibly lost over multiple millennia at higher warming levels. Paleoclimate records do not indicate abrupt changes in the carbon cycle up to 2Â°C of warming, while biogeochemical cycles and the Amazon rainforest exhibit potential risks of abrupt changes with higher confidence levels.
