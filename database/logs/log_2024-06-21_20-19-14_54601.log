James inquired about translating country names into ISO codes using Julia. I provided a detailed guide using the `DataFrames.jl` and `CountryData.jl` packages. Steps included package installation, creating a mapping function, and using it to translate country names to ISO codes within a `DataFrame`. The function could handle various country name variations and return "Unknown" for unrecognized names. The approach aimed to accurately map country names to ISO codes, enhancing data processing capabilities in Julia.
