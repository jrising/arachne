James inquired about effectively labeling a log axis in ggplot for GBP pounds ranging from 1e6 to 1e10, aiming for improved readability beyond standard notation like "1e+07." I provided an initial solution using `label_number_si()` from the `scales` package, emphasizing more intuitive labels like "1M," "10M," etc. After James reported an error due to the deprecation of this function, I updated my response to utilize `label_number()` with the `scale_cut` argument, incorporating `cut_short_scale()` for readable formatting. The final ggplot code allows for custom breaks and suffixes, improving clarity in visual data representation.
