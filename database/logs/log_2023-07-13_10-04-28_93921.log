In the previous conversation, James inquired about using the same SSL certificate for all subdomains on his website. The assistant explained that this is possible by using a Wildcard SSL certificate, which secures the main domain and all its subdomains. The Wildcard certificate has the format `*.yourdomain.com`, where the asterisk (*) represents any valid subdomain. The assistant advised James to check if his hosting provider supports Wildcard certificates and consider the costs, as they can be more expensive.
