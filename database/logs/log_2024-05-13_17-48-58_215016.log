James requested a character reference letter detailing an individual with extensive subject matter experience in employment law, including discrimination, harassment, and LGBTQI+ inclusion, as well as industry experience across various sectors like Higher Education and Healthcare. The applicant has over 140 days of arbitration experience, with bar admissions in Maine and New York, and Federal District Court admissions in relevant jurisdictions. They are fluent in Spanish and are studying additional languages. In response, I provided a comprehensive letter showcasing the applicantâ€™s dedication, adaptability, and passion for justice, emphasizing their qualifications and multilingual abilities. The letter was structured formally, encouraging the recipient to contact me for further information.
