The provided table presents estimates of damage to various sectors as a percentage of GDP, under different policy scenarios and time periods. The estimates cover total damages, drought and inland flooding losses, agriculture losses, damages from coastal impacts, and more. The results show that the largest losses are from catastrophic risks, with estimates ranging from 0.55% to 11.87% of GDP, depending on the scenario and time period. Mitigation policies have the potential to significantly reduce these impacts, with estimates ranging from a decrease of 0.25% to 8.56%. However, it's important to note that these estimates come with uncertainties.
