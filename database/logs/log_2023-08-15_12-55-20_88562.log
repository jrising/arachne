The table presented provides estimates of potential damage from climate change in various sectors, along with the avoided costs and expected changes associated with high mitigation policies. The analysis shows that by the end of the century, the largest losses are projected in the catastrophic risks sector, with an estimate of 4.1% (-2.8 - 11.9%) under current policies. However, following a high mitigation pathway would reduce these impacts by 2.9 percentage points (-2.0 - 8.6 pp). Other sectors, such as drought & inland flooding losses and annual costs from energy supply and demand, also show significant impacts. Despite uncertainties, the findings emphasize the importance of implementing strong mitigation measures to minimize potential damages and costs associated with climate change.
