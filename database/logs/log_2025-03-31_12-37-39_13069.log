In a discussion about R package documentation, James inquired about the source of a package's help index and how internal functions could be documented without appearing in the help index. I explained that the help index is generated from Roxygen comments or Rd files located in the `man` directory. Functions can be included or excluded from the help index by using specific tags: the `@export` tag makes functions accessible in the index, while the `@noRd` tag excludes them. Additionally, manually created Rd files can lack `\alias` entries to ensure certain functions remain internal. This selective documentation approach helps maintain a clean and user-friendly package interface.
