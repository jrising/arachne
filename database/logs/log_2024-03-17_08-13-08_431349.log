In a conversation about classic songs featuring werewolves, James sought recommendations beyond "Werewolves of London." I provided a list that includes "Werewolves of London" by Warren Zevon, known for its humorous tale of werewolf encounters. Other suggestions included "A Wolf at the Door" by Radiohead, "Hungry Like the Wolf" by Duran Duran, and "Bad Moon Rising" by Creedence Clearwater Revival, which, while not directly about werewolves, evoke related themes. I also mentioned "The Werewolf" by Paul Simon, using werewolf imagery metaphorically. This discussion highlighted the blend of direct and metaphorical connections to werewolves in music.
