The analysis presents damage estimates as a percentage of GDP for various sectors. Drought and inland flooding losses are projected to increase over time under current policies, with expected damages ranging from 0.08% to 0.57% by the end of the century. High mitigation pathways slightly reduce these impacts. Losses to agriculture show varied ranges but are generally mitigated under high mitigation pathways. Total annual damages across livestock and fisheries show a decreasing trend from 2011-2030 to 2081-2100. The best-estimate heat/cold mortality shows a decrease over time, and coastal impacts have mixed results. Trade losses increase over time, while catastrophic damage risks show significant potential impacts. The largest end-of-century losses are from catastrophic risks, estimated at 4.37% under current policies, but high mitigation pathways reduce these impacts by 2.93 percentage points.
