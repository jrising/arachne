The provided LaTeX table presents damage estimates (%GDP) for different policy scenarios and time periods. Key results include increasing drought and inland flooding losses, varying impacts on agriculture, and shifts in annual damages across livestock and fisheries. The table also captures total welfare change, costs from energy supply and demand, labor productivity losses, heat/cold mortality, damages from coastal impacts, trade losses, missing risks cost estimate, and catastrophic damage risks. Confidence intervals are provided for estimates.
