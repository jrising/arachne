Bathymetry data gaps have been identified as a crucial issue for Delaware's ocean and bay planning process. The reports by Dewberry Engineers (2018) and Trice et al. (2021) emphasize the need for updated, high-resolution, and easily accessible bathymetry data to support various activities and management efforts. Dewberry Engineers highlight the challenges of accessing reliable bathymetry data, including gaps in high-resolution data, outdated information, and lack of seamless data. They call for better tools for data retrieval and more frequent updates of the Coastal Relief Model (CRM). The Trice et al. report identifies the patchwork nature of bathymetry data and the need for additional full bottom surveys for comprehensive coverage, particularly in nearshore areas. Although the specific gaps mentioned may not pertain directly to Delaware, addressing these deficiencies in bathymetry data would help inform decision-making for offshore wind development, aquaculture siting, climate adaptation, and species habitat management in Delaware's planning process.
