James suggested splitting the Dev Day into two separate events: the first being a full day in NYC on December 12th, followed by a second meeting in January at the BEEX space focused on Building Energy (BE) programs. He emphasized the importance of including Alex from the communications team and Shubidah from the programs team in both sessions, ideally for a minimum of half a day but preferably the full duration. This restructuring aims to enhance discussions and ensure alignment on strategies and initiatives. James expressed his eagerness to receive feedback on the proposal and encouraged further discussion in upcoming meetings.
