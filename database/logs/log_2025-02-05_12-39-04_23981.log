In a recent conversation, James Rising shared details about his paper, "Drivers of the Country-Level Social Cost of Carbon," which focuses on the heterogeneous impacts of climate change and the social cost of carbon (SCCO$_2$). Key points include an extension of the PAGE-2020 model to 183 countries, introducing novel mapping techniques for climate uncertainty and updated socioeconomic data, leading to a global SCCO$_2$ estimate of \$219.75 per ton of CO$_2$. The discussion covered various modeling improvements and their impacts on spatial patterns of SCCO$_2$, notably emphasizing the significant influence of SSP scenarios and updated non-market damages in reflecting country-level variations. The paper aims to enhance understanding of climate damages as they relate to hazard, exposure, and vulnerability across different regions.
