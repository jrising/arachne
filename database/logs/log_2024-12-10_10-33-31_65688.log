James sought creative inspiration for the text on the back of his holiday postcard, which features images arranged in a honeycomb pattern. He wanted to explain this design and connect it to the themes of memory and exploration. I suggested starting with a cheerful introduction about the honeycomb as a metaphor for shared experiences, incorporating the idea of bees sharing flower locations. James liked this concept and mentioned wanting to include maps of places they visited, prompting a refined suggestion that linked their adventures to the bees' dance. Ultimately, he shared his own shorter text, reflecting on the sweetness of the season, and we collaboratively improved it for clarity and elegance.
