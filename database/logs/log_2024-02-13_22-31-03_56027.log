James asked for help changing ownership of a directory on Linux. Arachne suggested using the `sudo chown` command with the `-R` option to recursively change ownership. James encountered an issue where the ownership change did not take effect, and Arachne provided possible explanations: mount options, file system permissions, and SELinux/AppArmor settings. James shared the `/etc/fstab` line for the mounted file system, and Arachne explained that the options (`nosuid`, `nodev`, `nofail`, `x-gvfs-show`) should not directly affect ownership changes. Arachne recommended investigating other potential causes, such as file system permissions or SELinux/AppArmor settings.
