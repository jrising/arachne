James proposed a meeting to discuss the macroeconomic impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies, suggesting times next Wednesday or Friday morning (ET) between 9 am and noon. He planned to share a two-page summary with the participants prior to the meeting. In response to a request for a summary of the "Summary for Policy Makers," I informed James that I currently don't have access to that document but offered to help create a summary based on general knowledge of climate policy and sustainability if he provided key points or sections to discuss.
