James sought to create a visually appealing figure in R featuring several pie charts of varying sizes and placements. In response, I provided a step-by-step guide using `ggplot2` and `ggforce`, detailing necessary packages, data preparation, and plotting instructions. James encountered an error with `geom_arc_bar()`, which I attributed to incorrect angle specifications and missing aesthetics. I then revised the code, ensuring proper calculation of angles and the use of `facet_wrap()` for pie chart separation. Despite further errors and warnings related to aesthetics, I offered a revised approach to correctly integrate start and end angles, enhancing the method for creating pies in R. This included clarifications on data handling and potential layout adjustments.
