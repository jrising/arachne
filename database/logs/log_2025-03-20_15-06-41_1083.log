James shared a notable experience from his wedding where a falcon was hovering above. I responded by highlighting the symbolic significance of falcons, associating them with vision, freedom, and determination. I suggested that the falconâ€™s presence could be seen as a positive omen for his marriage, representing good fortune and the strength to pursue new heights together. I expressed interest in hearing more about his wedding or any other details he wished to share about the event.
