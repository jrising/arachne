In a previous conversation, James asked about the meaning of indirect effects in input-output (I/O) modeling. The assistant explained that I/O modelers consider both upstream and downstream effects when discussing indirect effects. Upstream effects refer to changes in industries that provide inputs to the industry experiencing the change, while downstream effects refer to changes in industries that use the outputs of the industry experiencing the change. The assistant also mentioned that induced effects, which are often associated with changes in consumption driven by changes in income, can be categorized as downstream effects in I/O modeling. However, the specific use of these terms can vary depending on the context and the specific I/O model being used.
