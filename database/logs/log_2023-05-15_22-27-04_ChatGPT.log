In this conversation, James asked about the meaning of indirect effects in Input-Output (I/O) modeling. The assistant explained that I/O modelers typically refer to both upstream and downstream effects when talking about indirect effects. Upstream effects are the effects on industries that provide inputs to the industry experiencing the change, while downstream effects are the effects on industries that use the outputs of the industry experiencing the change. The assistant also mentioned that induced effects can refer to changes in downstream industries and changes in consumption driven by changes in income. However, the specific use of these terms can vary depending on the context and the specific I/O model being used.
