James requested a table translating Xi Peng's co-authors into a structured format. I provided a table with authors' last names, first names, institutions (where available), and their latest publication year. Institutions varied from universities to tech companies worldwide, reflecting the diverse academic and industrial backgrounds of the researchers collaborating with Xi Peng. An "Unknown" category was used when recent institution information was unavailable.
