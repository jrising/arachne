In a previous conversation, James asked how to add a NULL value category to the legend in QGIS's layout designer. The assistant instructed him to go to the main QGIS interface and open the Layer Styling panel. From there, James was advised to click on the Legend tab and check the box labeled "Show All Classes" to display the NULL values in the legend. The assistant explained that changes made in the layout designer won't be reflected in the main QGIS interface and vice versa.
