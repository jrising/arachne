James sought methods to estimate elasticity from decile data. Initially, Arachne outlined a direct calculation approach involving proportional changes in variables across deciles. When James inquired about a regression method, Arachne advised organizing data with indicator variables for deciles, running a regression model to determine elasticity, and assessing statistical significance. These methods offer insights into how elasticity varies across different segments of the population based on decile data, providing a nuanced understanding of the relationships within the dataset.
