In a grant proposal addressing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the context of a hydrogen-based economy, the projects put forward by Chemours align well with the proposal's goals. Project 1 focuses on establishing a workforce pipeline through internships for students from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), while Project 2 assesses the environmental justice implications of the hydrogen economy. Project 3 evaluates economic adjustments by income group, promoting equity and diversifying procurement opportunities. However, there are some aspects not directly covered by the projects, including STEM promotion, community awareness and engagement, project deliverable accessibility, and the inclusion of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and MSIs in research and training. It is recommended to elaborate on collaboration with stakeholders and address these areas.
