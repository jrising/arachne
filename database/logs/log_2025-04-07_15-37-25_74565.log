James inquired about which function groups primarily inhabit the ocean floor, presenting a list that included flatfishes, reef-associated fish, benthopelagics, bathypelagics, bathydemersals, pelagics, demersals, rays, and sharks. I clarified that the main groups living on the ocean floor are flatfishes, demersals, bathydemersals, and rays, highlighting their bottom-dwelling behaviors. I also noted that while reef-associated fish are not strictly floor dwellers, they depend on reef structures, and mentioned that benthopelagics are more intermediate. Lastly, I explained that bathypelagics and pelagics generally inhabit the open ocean, while sharks can occupy a range of habitats, including both deep and surface waters.
