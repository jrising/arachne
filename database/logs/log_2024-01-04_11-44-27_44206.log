James asked how to set the names of columns in a DataFrame in Julia. Arachne provided code using the `rename!` and `rename` functions from the `DataFrames` library to accomplish this. James then asked how to use a vector of old names and new names to rename columns. Arachne suggested using a comprehension to iterate over the pairs of old and new names and apply the renaming. Alternatively, Arachne provided a code example using a loop to modify the original DataFrame in-place.
