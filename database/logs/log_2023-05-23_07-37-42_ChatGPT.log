James asked about using plug adapters with different round peg thicknesses in different countries. The assistant explained that the thinner round pegs (Type C plug) are commonly used in Europe, South America, and parts of Asia, while the thicker round pegs (Type E or F plug) are used in countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The assistant advised checking a reliable travel adapter guide or consulting with the power company in the country to ensure the correct adapter is used. James specifically asked about Portugal, and the assistant informed him that both Type C and Type F plugs are used there. Therefore, either adapter can be used, but James should ensure that his devices are compatible with the voltage in Portugal.
