James asked about using two different plug adapters with two round pegs of different thickness. Arachne explained that the thinner pegs are typically Type C plugs used in Europe, South America, and parts of Asia, while the thicker pegs are likely Type E or F plugs used in countries like Germany, France, and Belgium. James then specifically asked about using the adapters in Portugal, to which Arachne responded that both types of adapters can be used in Portugal since the country uses Type F and C power plugs and sockets. Arachne also reminded James to check the voltage compatibility of his devices.
