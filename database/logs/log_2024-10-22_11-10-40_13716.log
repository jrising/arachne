James inquired about adding an automatic "counter" for figures in a Google Docs document. I explained that Google Docs lacks a built-in feature for this but provided several alternatives: 

1. **Using an Add-on**: Suggested exploring add-ons like *Doc Variables* that may offer automation capabilities.
2. **Google Apps Script**: Offered a basic script that could incrementally number figures starting from "Figure: ", replacing them with "Figure 1:", "Figure 2:", etc.
3. **Manual Bookmarking**: Advised a manual approach through bookmarks if scripting isn't feasible, allowing for tracking changes without automated numbering.

I encouraged exploring these options, emphasizing the need for organized document management.
