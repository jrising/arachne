The PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model is an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) used to study climate economics. It estimates the costs and benefits of climate change policies by evaluating their impact on the global economy, ecosystems, and human health. Developed by Chris Hope at the University of Cambridge, the model incorporates updated scientific knowledge, economic data, and policy insights. The PAGE model uses a probabilistic approach to estimate the range of potential outcomes, taking into account uncertainties in climate sensitivity, mitigation costs, adaptation strategies, and impact valuation. It has been utilized to support policy analysis and decision-making processes at national and international levels.
