The PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model is an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) used for studying climate economics. It estimates the costs and benefits of different climate change policies and helps analyze their impact on the global economy, ecosystems, and human health. Developed by Chris Hope at the University of Cambridge, the model incorporates scientific knowledge, economic data, and policy insights to provide probabilistic estimates of potential outcomes. The PAGE model has been utilized for policy analysis and decision-making at various levels.
