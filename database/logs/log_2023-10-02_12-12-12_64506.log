In a section from the paper "Confronting the Environmental Kuznets Curve" by Dasgupta et al. (2002), the authors discuss the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality. While they are optimistic about the prospects of combining economic growth and environmental protection, they raise several concerns. Firstly, they argue that there is no evidence to support the idea that countries must tolerate lower environmental quality until their per capita incomes rise significantly. Benefit-cost analyses have shown that stricter pollution control is economically justifiable even in low-income economies. Secondly, they critique the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis, which suggests that high-income countries lower environmental standards to compete with low-income countries. Research has shown that pollution control does not impose high costs on businesses, and pollution havens have not emerged as predicted. The authors also highlight the need for broad regulatory changes and international cooperation to address the rise of other pollutants and environmental hazards. They emphasize the importance of developing regulatory capabilities in developing countries and highlight the role of long-term institutional capacity building. The authors conclude that addressing environmental challenges requires attention to long-term development, institutional capacity, and effective regulation, along with the design of appropriate financing mechanisms.
