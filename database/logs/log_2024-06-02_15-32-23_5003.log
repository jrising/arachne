James sought a solution to adding a timeout to a function in a Flask application after encountering a `ValueError` with the timeout-decorator due to Flask's multiple threads. I recommended using `threading` with a function wrapper to handle timeouts. The solution involved utilizing `threading.Timer` or creating a separate thread for the function with a timeout. I provided a code example demonstrating the implementation of a timeout wrapper function within a Flask application to achieve the desired functionality without being limited by the `signal` module. This approach ensures the function can be interrupted if it takes too long to execute, addressing the initial timeout issue effectively for James.
