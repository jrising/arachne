James sought assistance with customizing a heatmap in Julia using `Plots.heatmap`. He initially requested help to set the x-axis to display a specific datetime range from "2023-07-17 12:00:00" to "2023-07-18 23:00:00", with each column representing an hour. I provided a code example to generate a datetime sequence and set it as x-axis ticks.

James then noted that the x-axis had too many values and requested to display only every 6 hours instead. I modified the code to select every 6th hourly tick for the x-axis.

Finally, James wanted to simplify the x-axis labels to show just the hour instead of the full datetime strings. I advised on extracting the hour component from the datetime objects and updating the x-axis labels accordingly.
