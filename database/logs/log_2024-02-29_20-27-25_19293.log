James inquired about the sensibility of averaging Gini coefficients across countries to assess within-country inequality effects of a policy. Arachne explained that while mathematically valid, caution is needed due to differences in socioeconomic structures, the distribution of Gini differences, and within-country variations. Comparing averages depends on comparability, distribution shape, and considering within-country disparities. The average Gini index may oversimplify complex realities, highlighting the need for nuanced interpretation and additional statistical measures for a more comprehensive analysis.
