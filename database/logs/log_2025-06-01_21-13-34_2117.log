James inquired about terminology for someone who has not attended a group for many years. I provided terms such as "absent," "inactive," "lapsed," or "former" member. Additionally, I noted that if the individual chooses to re-engage, it could be seen as making a "return" or "comeback." I offered to give a more tailored response if a specific context was provided.
