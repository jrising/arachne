James sought assistance in crafting a conclusion for his paper on the disconnect between physical scientists and economists in characterizing climate risks. The dialogue emphasized the necessity for a transdisciplinary approach, calling for integrated modeling, improved communication between disciplines, and addressing uncertainties. Urgent research priorities included data disaggregation, integrating extreme events into economic models, studying adaptation strategies, and considering ethical dimensions. The drafted conclusion proposed fostering transdisciplinary literacy, enhancing communication with policymakers, and focusing on interdisciplinary collaboration to tackle climate challenges. The synthesis underlined the importance of bridging disciplinary divides for robust climate risk management and sustainable development.
