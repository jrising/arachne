In a discussion about drafting a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the New York Community Trust (NYCT), James provided insights from a meeting on October 9, 2024, where Arturo and Alex discussed organizational goals related to climate-ready buildings and funding needs. Key points included the aim for gap funding to support Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), technical assistance, and legal support. Arturo expressed skepticism about Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but noted a keen interest in initiatives that engage community foundations. He highlighted the significance of understanding NYCT's recent activities by reviewing press releases. James later inquired about the potential grant amounts NYCT offers nonprofits, to which I clarified that funding varies widely based on project needs and alignment with NYCTâ€™s priorities.
