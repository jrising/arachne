In this conversation, James requested assistance in drafting a Letter of Intent (LOI) for funding from the New York Community Trust, seeking $150,000 for the National Building Performance Standards Coalition (Coalition). He highlighted a lack of support from the new federal administration for the Coalitionâ€™s mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through better building policies. The Coalition, supported by the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), includes 48 jurisdictions and represents a significant portion of the nation's commercial building stock. The discussion focused on the importance of maintaining momentum in building decarbonization and climate justice, as well as plans for a project proposal that includes mapping Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and improving engagement with local communities. The LOI outlines the Coalition's impact, objectives, and the need for funding to continue its essential work.
