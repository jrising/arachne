James requested help ensuring student engagement beyond just the abstract of Carleton & Hsiang 2016. Arachne designed multiple-choice questions targeting specific details from the entire text to assess comprehension. Questions focused on methodologies driving climate impact research, the ongoing significance of climate on modern society, effective research designs, analogies for environmental influence, adaptation strategies, and the concept of "informational" adaptation. These questions aim to test students' understanding of key concepts and nuances presented in the full reading, fostering deeper engagement with the material.
