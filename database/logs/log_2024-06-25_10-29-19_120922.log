Since 2006, U.S. energy codes have improved building energy performance, leading to cost savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The necessity for robust codes has heightened due to increasing severe weather events and rising energy costs. However, ongoing resistance and challenges in the code development process endanger these advancements. Building Performance Standards (BPS) are crucial for a comprehensive approach to decarbonizing buildings, aiming to bring existing structures up to energy performance targets. More integration between BPS and traditional energy codes is essential for a unified strategy in enhancing building performance.
