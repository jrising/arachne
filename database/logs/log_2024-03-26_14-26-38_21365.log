James inquired about building a pandas DataFrame row by row in a loop in Python. I advised against directly appending rows in a loop due to performance issues and suggested creating a list of dictionaries with extracted values from objects, then constructing the DataFrame in one step. I provided a code snippet demonstrating the recommended approach using a loop to iterate over objects, extract values for columns, and append them to the data list. This method enhances efficiency, especially with larger datasets, compared to appending rows individually.
