In a recent conversation, James requested criteria for a full-time employee to assist two distinct teams: a substituting team and a fundraising team. For the substituting team, key criteria included role understanding, relevant experience, strong research and communication skills, interpersonal skills, organizational capabilities, adaptability, strategic thinking, tech-savviness, and a solid grasp of the organization's goals. The focus shifted to the fundraising team, where James sought additional qualifications including knowledge of federal grants, grant writing skills, project management, budgeting and financial literacy, effective relationship building, strategic thinking, and a strong ethical understanding of fundraising practices. The discussions emphasized the importance of skills tailored to each team's needs, particularly in prospect research and grant-seeking capabilities.
