In this conversation, James inquired about how to call a function after the `window.speechSynthesis.speak(...)` method completes. I provided guidance on using the `onend` event from the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object. I shared a code example illustrating how to create a `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`, define an `onend` handler to execute a function (named `myFunction()`) upon completion of the speech synthesis, and demonstrated where to place the call to `window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance)`. The example ensured clarity on how to integrate additional functionality post-speech.
