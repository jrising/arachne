In a previous conversation, James asked how to generate Monte Carlo draws from a distribution given its quantiles. Arachne explained that this requires interpolation and provided code examples in Python and R. She described how to construct the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) and use it to generate samples. Arachne highlighted that linear interpolation may introduce errors and recommended using quantiles representing the extremes of the distribution or fitting known distribution families for better approximations. She also mentioned that the provided code can be adjusted to suit specific distributions and requirements.
