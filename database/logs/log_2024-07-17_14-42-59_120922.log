The discussion focused on the corporate strategy and membership programs of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). IMT aims to address energy efficiency and climate resilience in buildings, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, where buildings contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Key components include empowering communities to advocate for safer housing and lower energy bills, supporting governments in human-centered legislation, and facilitating climate-conscious business practices. Although IMT does not have a traditional membership program, it fosters topic-specific communities, such as the Landlord-Tenant Energy Partnership and City Energy Project, to engage stakeholders in creating sustainable, energy-efficient environments.
