In a previous conversation, James asked how to collapse a DataFrame to the mean of all values grouped by a given column in Julia. Arachne explained that this can be done using the `DataFrames` package in Julia by using the `groupby` and `combine` functions. Arachne provided an example code snippet to demonstrate this process. James then asked how to obtain a list of all column names excluding the group column. Arachne guided James on how to achieve this using the `names` function in combination with the `Not` function from the `DataStructures` package. Arachne provided another example code snippet to illustrate the approach.
