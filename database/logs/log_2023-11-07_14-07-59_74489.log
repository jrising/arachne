The proposed project aims to estimate the current macroeconomic losses caused by climate change for each country globally. This methodology section focuses on the machine learning approach used to generate these estimates. The analysis utilizes a random forest model trained on a dataset consisting of country-year observations and Monte Carlo draws (\textit{DirectImpact\_it}). Various quality values are assigned as attributes to the model, derived from relevant metadata. These attributes capture the characteristics of each model element, such as temperature variables, rainfall, additional controls, unobserved heterogeneity, and underlying data. By querying the random forest model, the direct impacts of climate change on economic performance are estimated for each country and year. The results provide valuable insights into the economic losses incurred due to climate change.
