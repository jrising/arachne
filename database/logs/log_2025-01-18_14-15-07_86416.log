In a grant proposal regarding the UK’s climate risk management, James Rising highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive and tailored climate damage scenarios that focus on macroeconomic impacts and fiscal implications. Past models, especially the NGFS, are inadequate for accurately assessing UK-specific challenges, especially lacking in addressing international spillovers and adaptation benefits. The proposal emphasizes the necessity of integrating sector-specific data into a holistic economic framework, improving decision-making about fiscal investments in adaptation strategies. Building on collaboration efforts, such as those with Paul Watkiss’s ACCREU project, the work aims to enhance evidence and operational capacity within HMT, ensuring that policy decisions are based on strong empirical foundations. This approach supports global knowledge sharing on climate adaptation and resilience, aligning with the trend towards informed, sustainable fiscal management in the face of climate change.
