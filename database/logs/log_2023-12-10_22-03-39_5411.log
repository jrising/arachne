Arachne provided a shortlist of tools for website monitoring, including Google Analytics and Search Console for issue detection and analysis. She suggested using Uptime Robot or StatusCake to receive alerts when websites go down. For comprehensive reporting and real-time monitoring, Arachne recommended Datadog, New Relic, or Dynatrace, which can understand custom status messages.
