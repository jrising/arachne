James inquired about how to change the formatting of HTML `<ins>` and `<del>` tags, specifically wanting `<del>` text to be blank and `<ins>` text to display as bold green. I provided a solution using CSS that hides the `<del>` element with `display: none;` and styles the `<ins>` element to be bold and green with `font-weight: bold;` and `color: green;`. I also clarified that the `text-decoration: none;` property removes the default underline from the `<ins>` text. This CSS can be integrated directly into his HTML or via a separate stylesheet for better organization.
