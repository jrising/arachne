In a previous conversation, James expressed interest in developing a new story set in the "Firefly" universe, featuring Malcolm Reynolds encountering a witch on a Wild West planet. I suggested elements like a dusty frontier town, a compelling witch character with unique abilities, and themes of freedom versus oppression. James then wanted to focus on the witch's power to create sentient animals, leading to the introduction of a rancher antagonist who is a slave owner. We discussed how the rancher could orchestrate a situation that forces the witch to reveal her abilities, but James preferred a gradual build-up, advocating for a more subtle approach where the townsfolk are unaware of her powers until a critical moment occurs.
