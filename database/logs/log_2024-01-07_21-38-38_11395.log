In a previous conversation, James sought assistance in removing the text "ENGINE=MyISAM" from every `.sql` file in a directory. Arachne provided a Bash script that utilizes `grep` and `sed` commands to achieve this. The script iterates over each `.sql` file in the directory, using `sed -i 's/ENGINE=MyISAM//g' "$file"` to substitute the string globally with nothing. Arachne cautioned James to backup his files and noted that the command won't distinguish where "ENGINE=MyISAM" appears in the file, requiring adjustment if it occurs in places other than "CREATE TABLE".
