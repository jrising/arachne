James encountered an error using Pyppeteer, specifically a `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`, occurring after an async task fails. I suggested ensuring the browser instance closes correctly, handling exceptions surrounding each await block, and utilizing patterns like `async with` for better resource management. In response to his concern about making every await block complete, I advised wrapping each await statement in try-except blocks. I also proposed using `asyncio.gather()` with `return_exceptions=True` for collective task handling, which allows for individual errors without skipping final cleanup. These strategies aim to enhance reliability and clarity in handling asynchronous operations within his code.
