Weitzman's Dismal Theorem, introduced by economist Martin L. Weitzman in 2009, suggests that in situations where the probability of a catastrophic outcome is uncertain, the expected value of the situation may be infinite, making it challenging to determine the optimal policy response. In the context of climate change, this theorem highlights that policymakers cannot solely rely on cost-benefit analysis to determine mitigation efforts because the potential consequences of failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could be catastrophic. Weitzman argues for a precautionary approach, emphasizing the need to reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change as much as possible, even if it comes with significant short-term costs. The Dismal Theorem underscores the urgency of aggressive mitigation efforts and the importance of addressing climate change promptly.
