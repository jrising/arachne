Weitzman's Dismal Theorem, introduced by economist Martin L. Weitzman, states that in situations where the probability of an extremely negative outcome is uncertain but potentially catastrophic, the expected value of the situation may be infinite. In the context of climate change, this means that policymakers cannot rely solely on cost-benefit analysis to determine mitigation efforts. The theorem emphasizes the need for a precautionary approach, aiming to reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change as much as possible, even if it requires significant short-term costs.
