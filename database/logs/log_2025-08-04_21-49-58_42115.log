James is preparing a case study on climate adaptation in Bangladesh, focusing on long-term risks like flooding exacerbated by climate change. The conversation highlights critical components of Bangladesh's Climate Resilient Development Pathways (CRDP), exemplified by the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100). This comprehensive planning addresses socio-economic vulnerabilities and emphasizes the need for around $357.7 billion in funding, significantly more than local investment capabilities. James intends to interview members of the Bangladesh Ministry of Finance to clarify and refine his case study. Suggested interview questions focus on integration of planning strategies, economic implications, social equity, international finance engagement, success factors, and community feedback mechanisms—all aimed at enhancing the understanding of Bangladesh’s adaptation processes and benefits to the government.
