Fiscal risks encompass challenges that can threaten a government’s financial stability and its capacity to deliver public services. Key primary indicators, including the role of fiscal policy on growth and borrowing costs, are vital for understanding a government’s financial dynamics. Effective fiscal policies can promote economic growth, while high borrowing costs may hinder financing essential services. Secondary indicators, such as credit ratings, public expenditure, public revenue, and the growth of sovereign debt, provide additional insights into fiscal health and sustainability. Furthermore, assets at risk from physical impacts, especially due to climate change, can lead to unexpected losses, complicating fiscal conditions. Together, these indicators create a comprehensive view of fiscal risks, underscoring the importance of prudent financial management in ensuring long-term economic stability.
