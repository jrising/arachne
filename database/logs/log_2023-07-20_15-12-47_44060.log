In a previous conversation, James sought alternate expressions to convey the idea of indirect effects spreading throughout an economy, avoiding the economic connotations of the phrase "trickling down." The assistant provided five alternative suggestions: ripple effect, domino effect, knock-on effect, cascading effect, and spillover effect. These expressions capture the concept of impacts from one sector affecting others and proliferating throughout the entire economy. Using these alternative phrases allows James to convey his message without misleading connotations, while preserving the meaning and impact of his statement.
