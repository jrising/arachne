In this conversation, James seeks guidance on how to obtain prediction values from a regression model with state-level fixed effects, while ignoring those fixed effects. The assistant provides a step-by-step process to achieve this goal. James is instructed to fit the model using PanelOLS from linearmodels, extract coefficients for the other exogenous variables without the fixed effects, create a new data set for prediction without the fixed effects, and finally perform the prediction by taking the dot product of the prediction data and the coefficients. The assistant also notes that James can modify the procedure if he wants to apply certain coefficients to the fixed effects.
