In the previous conversation, James asked how to obtain prediction values from a PanelOLS regression model with state-level fixed effects, while ignoring the fixed effects or setting them to 0. The assistant provided a step-by-step procedure:

1. Fit the model using PanelOLS with entity effects:
   - `model = PanelOLS(dependent_var, exog_vars, entity_effects=True)`
   - `results = model.fit(cov_type='clustered', cluster_entity=True)`

2. Extract coefficient estimates for the other exogenous variables without the fixed effects:
   - `coefficients = results.params`
   - Drop the columns corresponding to fixed effects.

3. Create new prediction data without the fixed effects.

4. Perform the prediction:
   - `prediction = np.dot(prediction_data, coefficients)`

The assistant also mentioned that if James wants to set the fixed effect coefficients to 0, he should include those columns in the prediction data without including their coefficients in the prediction calculation.
