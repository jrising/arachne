James was experiencing an issue with the `load_dotenv()` function returning false when attempting to load a `.env` file without specifying its path. I explained that `load_dotenv()` searches for the `.env` file in the current working directory, and returning false indicates that the file was not found. I suggested checking the working directory using `os.getcwd()`, verifying the filename and its location, and considering the directory structure if the script was nested. I offered to help further if James provided more context about his project structure or scripting environment.
