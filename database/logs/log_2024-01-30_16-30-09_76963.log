Significant data gaps exist concerning jurisdictional and regulated areas in Delaware's ocean and bay, hindering the planning process. The legal boundaries, tribal areas, and USACE permits are often published as documents rather than accessible geospatial data, hindering activities such as offshore aquaculture siting and renewable energy planning. Data about Department of Defense (DoD) boundaries, including no-development areas and unexploded ordnance, are only provided on an as-needed basis, making siting new facilities challenging. Ocean disposal sites are managed on a permit-by-permit basis, lacking an integrated enterprise system. Poor management of fishery management areas, designated anchorages, and pilot boarding areas result in underutilization. The need for agencies to publish geospatial data alongside traditional documentation is crucial to address these data gaps and support Delaware's planning process. [185 words]
