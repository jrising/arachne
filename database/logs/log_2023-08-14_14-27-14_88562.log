The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is caused by multiple factors, including construction materials, energy usage, vegetation and soil displacement, and urban geometry. Concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat, while energy use generates waste heat. The reduction of vegetation and exposed soil decreases the cooling effect, and the physical layout of cities can trap heat. The exact contribution of each factor varies depending on specific characteristics. Ballpark figures suggest that construction materials and urban geometry are major contributors, with energy usage and decreased vegetation also significant. The UHI effect is a field of ongoing research, and gaining precision requires considering local and regional factors.
