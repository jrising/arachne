The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is caused by a combination of factors including construction materials, energy usage, vegetation and soil displacement, and urban geometry. While it is difficult to provide specific percentages, research suggests that construction materials and urban geometry are substantial contributors, with energy usage and decreased vegetation also playing a significant role. Overall, gaining precision in understanding the contribution of each factor requires considering local and regional factors.
