James sought guidance on using multi-level logistic regression modeling in R to examine how price influences selling behavior among respondents. He noted a student treated sell amounts as separate observations, leading James to question the validity of this approach. I provided step-by-step R code, including data simulation and model fitting using the `lme4` package's `glmer` function, with random effects for respondents. As the discussion progressed, James proposed simplifying the data-generating process to `sell_amount = a_i + 0.01 * price`, prompting an adjustment in the simulation and modeling steps. I emphasized the importance of comparing generated models, examining standard errors, and assessing model fit using AIC metrics to ensure an accurate modeling approach.
