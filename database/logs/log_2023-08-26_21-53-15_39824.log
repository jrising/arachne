James asked for guidance on tracking down pictures of a Lutheran dormitory in Inglewood, CA, where his grandparents met in 1950. The assistant provided several potential methods, including contacting historical societies, university archives, church archives, online archives, crowd-sourcing, and online newspaper archives. The assistant also suggested specific resources, such as the Inglewood Public Library's History Room Division and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Archives. The assistant recommended mentioning the name of the dormitory, the approximate period, the fact that it was a Lutheran setup, and location details in communications with relevant organizations. James was wished luck in his historical hunt.
