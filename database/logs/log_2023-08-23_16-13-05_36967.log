In a discussion about the future of the nonprofit sector and philanthropy in 2123, the following key points emerged:
- The nonprofit sector would integrate advanced technology, such as AI and robotics, to address societal problems. Global collaboration, digital and virtual communities, decentralized decision-making through blockchain technology, and a focus on sustainability would be prominent features.
- In the philanthrosphere, micro-donations and crowd-resourcing facilitated by blockchain and digital currencies would allow large-scale problem-solving. AI and data analytics would drive proactive and predictive philanthropy, while impact investment blurs the line between investment and donation. Transparency, accountability, and inclusive philanthropy would be priorities.
Overall, the nonprofit sector and philanthrosphere of 2123 would be unrecognizable compared to today but would maintain their core mission of making a positive difference.
