In this conversation, James provided a detailed excerpt regarding micro and macro-level effects of economic changes related to environmental shocks. Key points included micro effects like capital destruction, stranded assets, price volatility of raw materials, disruptions in production, and necessary adjustments in economic activities. Macro effects discussed were changes in prices, productivity impacts on GDP, investment needs for mitigation, socio-economic changes, and shifts in trade and capital flows. The interconnectedness of these effects and the importance of substitutability—both geographical and technological—were emphasized, highlighting how different actors respond to shocks. The conversation also referenced various studies and reports that investigate biodiversity risks and financial impacts related to ecological degradation.
