James inquired about Delmarva Power's use of demand pricing, which I explained involves charging based on peak electricity usage to manage grid strain. I also noted the influence of PJM Interconnection on such pricing and demand response programs in the region. I directed James to check Delmarva Power's website for specific pricing structures and information on demand response programs.
