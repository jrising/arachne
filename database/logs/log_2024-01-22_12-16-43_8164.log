James asked about what counts as an invited talk on an academic resume and whether workshops count. Arachne explained that an invited talk typically refers to a presentation or speech requested by an organization, institution, or conference, and the invitation is extended based on the individual's expertise or recognition in their field. Workshops can count as invited talks if the individual was expressly invited to present or lead a session due to their expertise. Arachne emphasized that the key attribute is being formally asked to provide expert insights. She advised including the title of the talk, the name of the hosting institution or event, the location, and the date on the resume. The specific organization of these details can depend on field conventions or job requirements.
