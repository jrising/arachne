In a discussion about a draft paper on "Data Gaps off the Delaware Coast," James sought help in crafting an abstract that reflects the core findings and objectives of the study. The conversation emphasized the importance of marine spatial planning (MSP) for balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, given the projected doubling of marine economic activities by 2030. Key points included the identification of critical data gaps in ecological, economic, and social dimensions within MSP and the need for a comprehensive catalog of marine data specific to Delaware. The proposed abstract encapsulated these themes, outlining the categorization of data types (physical, resource, usage, management, economic, and future/proposed) and highlighting the project's findings, including 460 data connections across 299 datasets, while acknowledging challenges related to data duplication.
