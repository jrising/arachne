James sought advice on attracting funding from companies in the real estate sector for a project aimed at encouraging market shifts toward better-performing buildings through sharing best practices and providing support. I suggested several strategies: 

1. **Identify Potential Companies:** Target those with vested interests in high-performance buildings.
2. **Understand Their Interests:** Research benefits gained from similar projects.
3. **Develop a Tailored Proposal:** Highlight direct benefits like property value appreciation and compliance with regulations.
4. **Show Tenant Benefits:** Emphasize the increasing tenant preference for green buildings.
5. **Collate Success Stories:** Use examples of successful projects for persuasion.
6. **Engage in Networking:** Attend industry events for introductions.
7. **Consider Hiring a Broker:** Use an intermediary for large projects.

I underscored the importance of aligning the project with company values and demonstrating a compelling return on investment.
