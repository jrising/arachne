James sought to adapt a workforce development initiative and vendor matchmaking model from Washington DC for a New York City context, aiming for funding from the New York Community Trust (NYCT). He highlighted significant employment challenges and economic inequality affecting diverse communities. In response, I provided a comprehensive proposal, outlining a Workforce Development Plan and Vendor Matchmaking Initiative. This proposal focused on job training in the high-performance building sector and creating connections between local vendors and businesses. Key components included market analysis, stakeholder engagement, training programs, and an online matchmaking platform, intended to foster economic growth and sustainability. I emphasized the potential for NYCT to support this transformative initiative, encouraging collaboration for equitable job creation and community empowerment.
