James was experiencing connection issues with his wifi every time he restarted his computer, which was due to the static IP address binding between his computer and the router. The router was refusing the connection because it was not configured to understand the binding during the DHCP process. To solve the issue, the assistant suggested adjusting the DHCP settings in the router. James could use DHCP Reservation instead of manual binding, ensure that the static IP is outside the DHCP range, double-check the MAC address, or try manually releasing and renewing the IP address lease. The assistant also emphasized the importance of saving or writing down current settings and consulting with a professional if unsure about making changes.
