The user is experiencing connection issues with their WiFi after restarting their computer. The issue is likely due to a static IP address binding between the router and computer. The assistant provides several potential solutions, including using DHCP reservation instead of manual binding, ensuring the static IP is outside the router's dynamic DHCP range, checking the MAC address bound in the router, and manually releasing and renewing the computer's IP address lease. The assistant also advises the user to take caution when making changes to network settings and suggests consulting a professional if needed.
