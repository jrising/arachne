In a conversation, James inquired about the grammatical correctness of using "who" versus "whom" in the sentence: "Please see the idea below and let me know if you have ideas for who to approach." Arachne affirmed that "whom" is the correct choice as it serves as the object of the preposition "for." She suggested that the revised sentence should read: "Please see the idea below and let me know if you have ideas for whom to approach." Additionally, she noted that in informal contexts, "who" could still be acceptable depending on the audience.
