James asked if he could add an auto-incrementing figure/table number in a Google Doc, but his organization's limited add-ons didn't offer this functionality. I suggested a manual solution using Google Doc's "Bookmark" feature. Whenever he wanted to change the figure/table numbers, he could insert a bookmark and then use it to create a link with the desired figure number. Each time he added a new figure or table, he would need to manually increase the number by 1. Although not the most elegant solution, it was the only feasible one given his organization's restrictions.
