The discussion centered on the HOT.DOC proposal, a doctoral program at the University of Graz aimed at integrating climate change and biodiversity research. Key strengths identified included its interdisciplinary integration of the Climate-Ecology-Society (CES) nexus, strong faculty expertise, and a comprehensive training program that promotes international networking and stakeholder engagement. The thorough approach to ethical considerations, including data privacy and safety protocols, further bolstered the proposal's credibility. However, potential weaknesses noted were the complexity of managing such an extensive program and the challenges of resource allocation among a large cohort of students. Overall, the proposal is portrayed as a forward-thinking initiative with significant potential impact on academia and societal challenges related to climate risks.
