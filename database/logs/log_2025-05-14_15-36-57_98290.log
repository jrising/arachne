In a conversation, James sought guidance on filtering a pandas DataFrame by values in two columns. I explained how to use boolean indexing, providing a sample code snippet that filters rows based on conditions in `Column_A` and `Column_B`. He then inquired about extracting a single value from a third column after filtering. I demonstrated how to use `.loc` to get this value from the filtered DataFrame. Finally, James asked if this could be done in one line, to which I provided a one-liner solution that performed the filtering and retrieval of the value from `Column_C` efficiently.
