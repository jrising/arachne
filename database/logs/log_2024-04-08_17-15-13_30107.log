James sought recommendations for textbooks for his Masters-level course exploring the interaction between human and natural systems. I provided a curated list covering topics such as Systems Dynamics, Microeconomics, Biophysical Modeling, Policy Design, Human-Nature Interactions, and Complex Systems. Each recommendation aimed to enhance students' understanding of the feedback loops between different systems and their consequences, helping foster sustainable practices. James was advised to review the selection to align with his teaching style and the desired level of detail for his students.
