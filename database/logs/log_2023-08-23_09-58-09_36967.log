Autumn Bland, a Master's candidate in Sustainability Management from the University of Waterloo, expressed interest in continuing her education at the Ph.D. level in the area of water governance and conservation policy. Her experience in working with communities and her focus on incentive programs to influence climate and water-related policies align well with the Ph.D. program in Marine Policy at the University of Delaware. Although funding may be limited, James Rising, from the School of Marine Science & Policy, encouraged Autumn to apply by the end of the year and mentioned that she could mention James in her statement of purpose due to the alignment of her research interests with his work in climate change risks, food systems, and interdisciplinary quantitative modeling. The response email followed a brief and concise format, emphasizing Autumn's compatibility with the Ph.D. program and the potential linkage between her research aspirations and faculty interests.
