Chamanthi, a Sri Lankan graduate teaching assistant, contacted James Rising expressing interest in pursuing further studies in marine science. She has a solid background in marine biology, marine ecology, and ecotoxicology, but lacks a focus on economics or policy. James suggested that Chamanthi might be better suited for the natural science programs offered by the School of Marine Science & Policy. He recommended her to directly contact Dr. Xinfeng Liang for supervision within these programs. James also mentioned that considering her strong background and teaching experience, pursuing a Ph.D. might be worth considering, but funding is limited. He advised her to mention him in her statement of purpose if her research interests align with his work. Finally, James encouraged Chamanthi to apply by the end of the year to be considered for any available funding opportunities.
