James inquired about the fluorinated gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol. I detailed the key types of gases, including Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are primarily used as refrigerants; Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), often released during aluminum production and utilized in the electronics industry; and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF₆), used in high-voltage electrical equipment. I emphasized that, although these gases constitute a smaller fraction of overall emissions compared to CO₂, their significantly higher global warming potential necessitates regulation. Furthermore, I mentioned the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which aims to reduce HFCs, underscoring ongoing international efforts to address climate change.
