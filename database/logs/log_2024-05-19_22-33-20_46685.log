James sought help debugging SQLAlchemy code to handle inserts and selects properly. The conversation covered correcting select queries to include all table columns and ensuring inserts are committed before querying. Further, resolving errors in accessing column values by name in fetched rows involved using a dictionary approach with keys obtained from the `RowProxy` object. The solution emphasized handling SQLAlchemy row access intricacies to process data effectively and avoid errors, guiding James towards improved database interactions in his code.
