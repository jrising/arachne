James was experiencing an error in ggplot when adding the `coord_map()` function to his plot. The error suggested a conflict between character and list data types. The assistant advised James to check that the values `-50` and `65` were of numeric type and not list or data frame. The assistant also suggested updating to the latest version of ggplot2 and ensuring that the dataset did not contain any incompatible data types. Additionally, the assistant recommended trying to add the `ylim` argument within a new `coord_cartesian()` line.
