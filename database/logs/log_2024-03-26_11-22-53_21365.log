James inquired about sharing data frames between R and Julia efficiently and with longevity. The assistant recommended using the Feather format, which is high-performance, space-efficient, and compatible with multiple languages. Instructions were provided for using Feather in R with the `arrow` package and in Julia with the `Arrow.jl` package. Limitations of Feather regarding unsupported data types were highlighted, advising conversion if needed. Additionally, the assistant suggested considering formats like Parquet or HDF5 for extensive metadata handling beyond Feather's capabilities.
