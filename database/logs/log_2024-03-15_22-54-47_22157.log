James inquired about incorporating a node with constant weights into a neural network. Arachne explained the concept of using non-trainable nodes or layers, referred to as "fixed" or "frozen" layers, to include fixed features in a model. While these elements can enhance network functionality with predefined functions, they limit the model's adaptability by restricting updates to specific weights. Arachne advised James to apply this technique judiciously, considering its implications on learning capacity and the necessity of maintaining certain features unchanged during training.
