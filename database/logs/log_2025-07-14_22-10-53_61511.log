This discussion involved summarizing a detailed section on estimating non-market damages from climate change for an academic paper appendix. Key points included the distinction between market and non-market damages, with the latter found to significantly contribute to total welfare damages. The synthesis highlighted the use of the MERGE IAM model and the incorporation of the meta-analysis by Howard et al. (2017) to update the calibration. The approach emphasizes the reliance on willingness-to-pay (WTP) metrics linked to income and temperature. The updated findings indicate that WTP at 2.5Â°C warming is 3.8% of GDP. The non-market damage calculation uses a hockey-stick function to express rapid damage growth at elevated temperatures. The summary intended to bridge the technical details to a more accessible explanation for the paper, noting that further information is available in the supplementary information.
