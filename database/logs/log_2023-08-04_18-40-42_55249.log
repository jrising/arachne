James asked how to create a citation for a PDF added to his Zotero library. I explained that Zotero has a feature for automatically retrieving metadata from PDFs. If Zotero can't find the metadata, James can manually add information like author, title, publication, and year to create a full citation. I advised James to search online for the document if he couldn't find the necessary information.
