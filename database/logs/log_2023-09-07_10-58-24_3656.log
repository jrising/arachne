In a previous conversation, James asked how to find the asymptotic level (A) and decay rate (r) of a negative feedback loop given a couple of points on the graph. Arachne provided a step-by-step approach to estimate A and r. The approach involved identifying two points on the graph, calculating the difference in logarithms of the y-values, calculating the difference in x-values, using the formula for exponential decay to solve for r, and finally using one of the points to solve for A. Arachne noted that this approach assumes the negative feedback loop follows an exponential decay pattern.
