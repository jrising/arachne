In a previous discussion, the user asked about setting up a narrow side panel next to a larger content window using Flowbite, a utility first CSS framework based on Tailwind CSS. The assistant provided a solution using CSS Grid utilities, suggesting a grid layout with two columns. The first column represents the sidebar and is set to take up 1 fraction of available space, while the second column represents the larger content window and is set to take up 3 fractions. The assistant shared a code snippet as an example, demonstrating how to implement this layout.
