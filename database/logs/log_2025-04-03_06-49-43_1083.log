This conversation focused on the systemic and endogenous risks associated with water stress in the Colorado River basin. High water prices threaten the viability of small farmers, while persistent droughts increase costs across the agricultural sector, leading to heightened credit and market risks for financial institutions. Increased prices for commodities like cattle feed are examples of the adverse economic impacts stemming from water shortages. The discussion also explored the emergence of California's water futures market, raising concerns about the commodification of water and potential market manipulation. Ultimately, the conversation highlighted the dual nature of financial impacts: while negative effects seem prevalent, there are opportunities for financing sustainable practices to support ecological benefits and resilience for farmers.
