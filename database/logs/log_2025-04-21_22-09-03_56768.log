In our previous conversation, James faced issues pushing changes to his Overleaf project via Git, receiving an "internal error" from the server regardless of file size. I suggested methods to split a large commit into smaller ones using interactive rebase, or resetting to make multiple smaller commits. After successfully amending the commit to a half-MB image, the push still failed. I provided further recommendations, including checking file types, testing with different small files, using alternative upload methods, checking Git configuration settings, and contacting Overleaf support for assistance. Additionally, I suggested trying a different network to rule out connectivity issues. The overarching theme was addressing the persistent internal error encountered during the push process.
