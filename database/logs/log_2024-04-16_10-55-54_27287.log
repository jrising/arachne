James sought guidance on calculating "expenditure share" from an MRIO matrix. In response, the assistant explained the process: first, summing total expenditure for each region, then calculating the expenditure share for a specific item by dividing the expenditure on that item by the total expenditure. This process allows for analyzing how much each region spends on a particular item relative to its total expenditure. The assistant provided a step-by-step guide in Julia code, emphasizing the importance of adjusting column numbers for different items of interest.
