In a recent email, Sheikh Nur Ataya Rabbi expressed their interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. Sheikh's research interests and experience align well with James Rising's work on climate change-related topics. In the response, James acknowledges Sheikh's compatibility with the program and encourages them to apply by the end of the year to be considered for available funding. James also suggests that Sheikh mentions him in their statement of purpose to highlight their interest in James's work and their potential fit within the program. In a postscript, James mentions the possibility of colleagues or friends who have connections with the Mid-Atlantic area or universities such as MIT, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, and expresses interest in hearing about these connections.
