James asked about the typical length of talks, discussions, and Q&A sessions for a two-hour session at the AEA's ASSA meeting. Arachne suggested a structure for the session, consisting of an introduction, four talks with presentations, discussant remarks, and Q&A sessions, and a wrap-up/Q&A session. Arachne provided specific times for each component and emphasized the importance of flexibility and communication with presenters and discussants to ensure the session stays on schedule.
