James sought a method in Python to extract and replace numbers in brackets within a string using a custom function for processing. Arachne provided a detailed solution using Python's `re` module. Key points included defining a processing function, using `re.sub` with a custom replacement function to find and replace numbers within brackets, and employing a regex pattern to match the numbers. The example demonstrated how to implement this solution, emphasizing customizing the `process_number` function to suit specific processing requirements.
