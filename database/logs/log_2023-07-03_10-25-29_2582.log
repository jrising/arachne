Rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are predicted to decrease the nutritional value of crops, including macronutrients like proteins and micronutrients like iron and zinc. Studies show that high CO2 levels reduce protein levels in crops such as rice, wheat, and potatoes, while also decreasing important micronutrients in widely consumed food crops like rice, wheat, barley, and soybeans. The exact mechanism behind this is not yet fully understood, but it is believed that elevated CO2 levels may hinder nutrient absorption from the soil or dilute nutrients within the plant tissues. Other theories propose that higher CO2 levels disrupt natural plant processes and biochemistry, ultimately leading to reduced nutrient content. However, real-world impacts will be influenced by farming practices, soil quality, and other factors. Scientists are actively researching the consequences of reduced crop nutrient value for global nutrition and health.
