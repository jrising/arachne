Rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are expected to decrease the nutritional value of many crops by reducing the concentrations of proteins, iron, and zinc. The exact mechanism behind this is not entirely understood, but it's thought that elevated CO2 levels may impact the plant's ability to absorb nutrients or alter its natural processes. The impacts will vary between crop types and specific nutrients, and real-world impact will depend on various factors including farming practices and soil quality.
