In a previous conversation, James asked how to build a function in R that takes two functions as arguments, along with their arbitrary parameters, and passes these parameters into the corresponding functions. Arachne explained that the `...` operator in R can capture arbitrary arguments and pass them to other functions. She provided an example of how to use this operator to create a function that takes two random number functions, such as `rnorm` and `dnorm`, and their parameters, and returns the results of each function. Arachne also noted that not all arguments will be applicable for both functions, so it's important to consider this when using the ellipsis operator.
