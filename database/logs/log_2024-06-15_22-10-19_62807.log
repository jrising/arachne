James sought to filter events from an ICS file within one month of the current date. Initially encountering a `TypeError` comparing `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.date`, I advised converting dates to `datetime` objects for comparison. The final code provided accurately filters events based on start dates within the next month, ensuring seamless execution without errors.
