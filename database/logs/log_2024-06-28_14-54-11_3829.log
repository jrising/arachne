James asked how to look up a value in a column based on a given value in another column in Google Sheets. The assistant provided two methods using `VLOOKUP` and `INDEX` with `MATCH` functions. Method 1 involved using `VLOOKUP` to search for a value in Column A and retrieve the corresponding value in Column B. Method 2 used `INDEX` and `MATCH` together to accomplish the same task. These methods enabled James to effectively look up values in one column based on values in another column within Google Sheets.
