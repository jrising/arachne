James sought assistance on displaying multiple histograms in a Plotly plot within an R Shiny app. Initially focusing on overlaying and positioning histograms side-by-side, guidance was given on moving the legend to the upper-right and removing the y-axis label. After encountering issues with lingering space, adjustments were made to ensure a snug fit for the data and to address excess space around the plot area. The final solution involved modifying the margins to eliminate extra space left of the y-axis numbers post-label removal, providing a comprehensive approach to refining the plot presentation.
