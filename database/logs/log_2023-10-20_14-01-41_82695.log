James inquired about the population south of Egypt that formed a super-religious kingdom during the New Kingdom period. Arachne responded that the population referred to the Nubians, who formed the Kingdom of Kush. Arachne described the Nubians' deep spirituality, their influence on Egypt, and their worship of both Egyptian and Nubian gods, including their own lion-headed warrior god. Afterward, James asked if the Nubians also ruled over Egypt, and Arachne confirmed this, explaining that the Nubians of the Kingdom of Kush ruled Egypt during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. Arachne further elaborated on the cultural and political exchange between Nubia and Egypt during this period, the Nubian pharaohs' efforts to revive Egyptian culture, and their eventual overthrow by the Assyrians. Overall, the Nubians' influence and contributions left a lasting impact on Egyptian history and culture.
