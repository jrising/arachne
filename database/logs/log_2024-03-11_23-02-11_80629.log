Agnes Baiden, a new MSc Environmental Science & Management student at UDel, expressed interest in a graduate assistantship position focused on climate change research. Despite her fit with James' research, limited funding was highlighted. Agnes did not have education ties to specific universities or reside in the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area. A response was crafted emphasizing her alignment with the program, the potential for funding constraints, and the encouragement to apply for any available funds by the year's end.
