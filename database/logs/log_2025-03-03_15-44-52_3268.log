James inquired about converting a sparse matrix in `dgCMatrix` format in R to a format that includes row and column indices for non-zero values. I provided a solution using the `summary()` function to extract this information into a triplet format. He later asked if there was a way to efficiently find non-zero columns for a specific row without converting the matrix. I initially made an error regarding the matrix structure, mistakenly referring to a non-existent `j` slot. Upon correction, I shared the appropriate method using the `@p` and `@i` slots of `dgCMatrix` to determine non-zero column indices directly, ensuring an efficient process without unnecessary transformations.
