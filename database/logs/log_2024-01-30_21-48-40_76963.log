In a conversation about data gaps in Delaware's ocean and bay planning process, James provided a summary of the key issues and data requirements for ocean disposal based on a report by Dewberry Engineers (2018). The issues include identifying suitable sites for dredge material disposal, preventing impacts on marine navigation routes, and maintaining shipping channels, harbors, and ports. The data requirements encompass jurisdictions and regulated areas, commercial fishing effort tracked through Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and Vessel Trip Reports (VTR), human and cultural use areas, bathymetry, and species and habitat locations. However, the report did not explicitly address any data gaps in relation to these requirements. Further research is needed to identify any existing data gaps that could hinder the planning process's ability to address these issues and data requirements effectively.
