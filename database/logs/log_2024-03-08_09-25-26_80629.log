James inquired about calculating the impact of a reduction in output in one country on another using a global input-output (I/O) table. Arachne detailed using Leontief's input-output model, recognizing matrix components, developing the inverse matrix, and calculating output changes. James then asked about aggregating the I/O table, and Arachne explained the process to estimate impacts with a uniform trade reduction. Finally, James sought clarification on normalizing the aggregated I/O table, and Arachne advised dividing each cell by the total sum to reflect proportional output consumption domestically and internationally. This guidance enables James to analyze the ripple effects of trade shocks across countries effectively.
