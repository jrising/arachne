In a discussion about implementing branding guidelines into ggplot figures, the user, James, provided a sample ggplot command and requested the integration of a color scheme using "night," "molten," and "ice" colors, along with typography specified in TTF files. Recommendations included loading the custom fonts from a specified directory using the `extrafont` package and utilizing transparent versions of the night color. Further, it was suggested to create a custom theme for ggplot to apply branding elements without overwriting previously set properties, such as plot margins and legend positions. James wanted a method to add this custom theme without dropping existing configurations, which was addressed by defining separate theme elements. The final code example demonstrated how to selectively combine themes within ggplot.
