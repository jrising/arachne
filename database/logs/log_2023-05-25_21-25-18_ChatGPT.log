The coastal economy of Delaware plays a critical role in the state's overall prosperity, with sectors like tourism, real estate, and finance contributing significantly. Over the past decade, the coastal economy has experienced substantial growth, outpacing the US and Delaware economies as a whole. Direct coastal activities have resulted in thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in labor income, industrial output, and value added. Coastal activities also generate substantial tax revenue at local, state, and federal levels. The report emphasizes the importance of investing in climate resilience measures to protect coastal communities and the economy. Additionally, the creation of a "Coastal Barometer" is proposed to monitor the health of the coastal economy and inform decision-making.
