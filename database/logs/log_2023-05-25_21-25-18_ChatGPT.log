The coastal economy of Delaware has experienced significant growth over the past decade, outpacing both the US and Delaware economies as a whole. Residential development has been a major driver of this growth, along with the tourism industry and the finance and real estate sectors. The direct coastal activities have resulted in thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in labor income, industrial output, and value added. When considering indirect and induced activities, the coastal economy supports even more jobs and adds billions more to the economy. Coastal activities also contribute significantly to tax revenue at local, state, and federal levels. The report emphasizes the need for investments in climate resilience to protect coastal communities and the economy. It also proposes the creation of a "Coastal Barometer" to track the health of the coastal economy and inform decision-making for future development.
