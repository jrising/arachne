James requested short titles for his report on the impact of climate change on country GDP. Arachne provided several options, including "Climate Cost" and "GDP Erosion," "Invisible Drain" and "Climate vs. GDP," "Warming Penalties" and "Lost GDP," "Hot Economies" and "Fading GDP," and "Climate Debt" and "Hidden GDP Losses." These titles convey the idea of climate change negatively affecting GDP in a concise and attention-grabbing manner.
