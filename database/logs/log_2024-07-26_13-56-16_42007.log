James needed guidance on setting up a virtual environment for Python 2. I provided step-by-step instructions to install `virtualenv` for Python 2, create a virtual environment specifying the Python 2 interpreter, activate the environment, install packages with `pip`, run Python 2 code within the environment, and deactivate it when done. The process ensures running Python 2 code independently without conflicting with the system's default Python version.
