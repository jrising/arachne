James discussed teaching Climate Change Economics, including student assignments and the topics covered in Chapter 5 of Tol's textbook. Arachne provided multiple-choice questions to assess student understanding, covering the effects of climate change on ecosystems, global food production, adaptation strategies, valuation methods for environmental goods, challenges in benefit transfer, and differences between willingness to pay and willingness to accept compensation. The questions aimed to test knowledge on key concepts like impacts on species, food production trends, the role of adaptation in climate change mitigation, valuation methods, and understanding willingness to pay versus accept compensation.
