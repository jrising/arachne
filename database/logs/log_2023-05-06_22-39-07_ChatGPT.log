The discussion revolved around regression trees where the leafs are linear models instead of constants. It was mentioned that such trees are called model trees or linear model trees, which combine the advantages of decision trees and linear regression. The user inquired about whether the `ranger` package in R can be used to create random forests from model trees. The response explained that, as of September 2021, the `ranger` package does not directly support this functionality. However, it was suggested to use the `partykit` package in combination with the `mob()` function to fit a model tree with linear models in the leaves and create an ensemble (forest) of these model trees using a bootstrap aggregation strategy.
