In this conversation, James asked about a regression tree called a Model Tree, where the leaf nodes contain linear models instead of constants. The assistant explained that model trees combine decision trees and linear regression, providing interpretability and improved predictive performance when relationships are not constant within partitions. James then inquired about creating random forests from model trees using the `ranger` package in R. The assistant informed James that, as of September 2021, the `ranger` package does not directly support this functionality. Instead, the assistant suggested using the `partykit` package in conjunction with the `mob()` function to fit model trees with linear models in the leaves and generate an ensemble of model trees using a bootstrap aggregation strategy. The assistant provided a simple example showcasing this approach.
