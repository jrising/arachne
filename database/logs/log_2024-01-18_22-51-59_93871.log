James is seeking guidance on how to fill out a section requesting "Projected Research Returns" for a potential future position at his university. He wants to suggest that the hire could bring in 1 month of salary in the first year and 2 months in the second year. Arachne explains that the "Projected Research Returns" section typically asks for the indirect costs, or Facilities and Administration (F&A) costs, that the university would recover from grants. F&A costs cover not only salary but also infrastructure and administrative overhead. Arachne advises James to use a standard F&A rate (e.g., 60%) and calculate the indirect costs based on the direct costs he provided. She provides an example calculation and suggests double-checking with the university's guidelines.
