In a previous conversation, James asked the AI memory system to create a digest of past discussions. The log entries included topics such as exploring brick houses, challenges of sustainable goal setting, hackathons, DNS record TTL, a climate impact assessment, selling a house with solar panel agreements, advantages of bricks in construction, economics of climate change impact in Delaware, and climate damage estimates. James then asked the AI, "What is it called to raise your house to avoid flooding risk?" The AI responded that the process is called "house lifting" or "house elevating," which involves temporarily separating a structure from its foundation and raising it to reduce potential flood damage.
