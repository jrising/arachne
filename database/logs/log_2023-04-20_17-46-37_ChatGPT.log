James is deciding on papers to include in his tenure packet for quantitative environmental policy. The discussion focuses on trade-offs, such as high-impact vs. first-authored papers, advisor vs. personal papers, and breadth vs. coherence. The assistant provides suggestions for balancing these trade-offs and advises on including peer-reviewed perspectives or reviews. James lists his papers for consideration, and the assistant recommends a selection of 5 papers. Later, James mentions a newly accepted single-authored paper, and the assistant suggests dropping one non-first-authored paper to include it in the tenure packet.
