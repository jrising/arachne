In this conversation, James seeks guidance on selecting papers to include in his tenure packet for his work in quantitative environmental policy. He asks about trade-offs such as high-impact papers vs. low-impact, first-authored papers, papers first-authored by his advisees vs. his own papers, and papers that show breadth of interests vs. a coherent story. The assistant advises James to strike a balance by including a mix of high-impact and first-authored papers, prioritizing papers that showcase his contributions, considering papers with significant contributions from his advisees, and aiming for a balance between breadth of interests and a coherent story. When James provides a list of papers, the assistant recommends a selection of five that include a mix of high-impact, first-authored, and collaborative papers. When James mentions a newly accepted single-authored paper, the assistant suggests dropping a non-first-authored paper to include it. The final selection includes a combination of papers that demonstrate James' research accomplishments and ability to lead independent and collaborative projects.
