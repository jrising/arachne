James Rising received an unsolicited email from Dr. Gr√ºnwald about potential collaboration with Novustat GmbH for clinical publications. Initially, Arachne drafted a polite response expressing appreciation but stating that James was not in need of support. James requested a colder tone to discourage further contact. Arachne revised the response to be more formal and distant, clearly indicating that James would not be pursuing collaboration and expressing thanks for understanding. The final draft reflected James's intent to limit future interactions.
