James asked for dim sum restaurant recommendations in NYC's lower east side that would be suitable for pescatarians and children. The assistant provided three options: Jing Fong, known for its variety of seafood and vegetable options in a lively atmosphere; Nom Wah Tea Parlor, an iconic spot with pescatarian-friendly options in a vintage ambiance; and Dim Sum Go Go, which offers a modern take on dim sum with various vegetarian and seafood options. The assistant advised James to inform the server about any dietary restrictions.
