James inquired about changing the "owner" of a GitHub pull request. I explained that GitHub doesn't permit directly changing the owner, suggesting a workaround: closing the original pull request, branching from the same source, creating a new pull request, and including the original author in the new PR's documentation. This method allows for reassigning responsibility while preserving the original context and clarity of the changes.
