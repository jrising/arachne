The report investigates data gaps in activities in the Delaware ocean and bay, focusing on spatial planning. The "Integrated Science Plan for Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic Waters" by RWSC is used to identify missing biological data. The analysis includes marine mammals, birds, bats, sea turtles, and protected fish. While data on marine mammals and protected fish are available across multiple databases, some gaps exist, such as high-definition aerial imagery and eDNA data for marine mammals, and no radar/lidar studies or seabird diet data for birds. Bats share similar data availability, but no datasets are missing. Sea turtles have adequate representation but lack high-definition aerial imagery and ROV video data. No missing datasets are identified for protected fish. The report emphasizes the need for data standards and the collection of missing data to improve the coherence and usability of the datasets.
