Dr. James Rising from the University of Delaware is developing a project titled "A Coastal Barometer: Model-driven co-design for the real-time health of Delaware’s coastal economy," a Topic-Focused Research Project. The project aims to empower Delaware’s coastal communities through a dashboard tool that monitors the coastal economy's health amidst environmental threats and changing tourism dynamics. It employs a mixed-methods approach, including economic impact assessments and stakeholder co-design workshops, to ensure user-friendly outputs relevant to community needs. Key anticipated outcomes include enhanced strategic planning, informed decision-making, and improved economic resilience, facilitating sustainable growth and effective navigation of future challenges in Delaware’s coastal economy.
