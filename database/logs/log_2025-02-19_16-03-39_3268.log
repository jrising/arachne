James inquired about the shareability of deliverables from a Horizon 2020 grant due to the quality of the materials. I confirmed that these materials are generally intended for public dissemination, barring any confidentiality clauses or IP restrictions. I advised him to check the Grant Agreement for dissemination terms, ensure peer agreement before sharing, properly acknowledge the Horizon 2020 program and contributors, and consider the accessibility of the format. Sharing the materials could enhance the project's impact and encourage collaboration, aligning with Horizon 2020's goals.
