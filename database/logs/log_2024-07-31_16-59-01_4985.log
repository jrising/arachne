James is integrating optimal EV charging plans with determining surplus energy for selling to the grid in advance. The AI suggests a Stochastic Programming Approach with scenario analysis, Robust Control using confidence intervals, and a Combined Value Function to balance EV utility and energy commitments. Implementation steps involve modeling scenarios, solving for optimal actions, aggregating expected energy, defining an overall objective, and optimization. This approach ensures efficient control of EV charging while providing a reliable estimate for energy sales, avoiding overly conservative estimates based on worst-case scenarios.
