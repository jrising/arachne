James asked how to extend one dataframe with another using pandas. I provided instructions on using the `concat()` function to append dataframes along rows or columns. I also mentioned aligning indexes and resetting them if needed. Additionally, I shared how to use the `append()` function to add new rows to an existing DataFrame, emphasizing the importance of having the same columns in the DataFrames being combined.
