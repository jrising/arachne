James inquired about translating the Hessian from a non-linear optimization into standard errors for parameters. I explained the steps involved: obtaining the Hessian matrix, computing the variance-covariance matrix, and extracting standard errors. I highlighted the importance of the Hessian being invertible and the optimization solution corresponding to a local minimum. I offered to provide tailored guidance based on specific software or implementation details.
