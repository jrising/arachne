James asked for assistance on formatting datetimes in R parsed with lubridate to YYYYMMDD. Arachne provided a detailed explanation using the `format` function with a sample code snippet. The solution included creating a datetime object, formatting it as `YYYYMMDD`, and displaying the result. James was encouraged to seek further help if needed.
