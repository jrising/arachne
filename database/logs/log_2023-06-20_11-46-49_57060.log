James sought guidance on filling out an IRB application for his project on the uses of ocean and bay waters. He shared his current descriptions for the purpose and procedures sections and sought suggestions for improvements. James also requested content for the risks and benefits sections. I suggested some adjustments to the purpose and procedures sections and provided content for the risks and benefits sections. James expressed gratitude for the assistance.
