James sought guidance on integrating new directives into an Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan for a grant proposal for the NOWASTING project. The plan focused on improving resilience and adaptive capacity for small-holder farmers and fishers in Nigeria and Senegal. Arachne suggested integrating the new materials into different sections, emphasizing user engagement, dissemination and publication protocols, protection and access rights, and timeliness of information release. Arachne provided draft materials for each section, which included stakeholder engagement methods, dissemination protocols, and open access principles. James expressed gratitude for the guidance and wished for success in achieving the project's goals of enhancing food security, nutrition, and health outcomes while combating climate change.
