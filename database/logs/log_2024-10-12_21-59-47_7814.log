James Rising requested assistance in drafting a response to a student's inquiry about various academic programs at the University of Delaware, particularly the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics. He outlined key program details, emphasized the transition of the Masters in Marine Policy to a new Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track, and mentioned the limited funding available for Ph.D. candidates. James aimed to direct the student to a new form for program selection and to encourage the student to mention him in their statement of purpose if they were well-qualified. A draft response was provided that echoed these objectives while maintaining a professional tone.
