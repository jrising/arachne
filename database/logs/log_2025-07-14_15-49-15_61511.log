The socioeconomic data from CMIP6 extends to 2100, and we enhance these timeseries to 2300 by applying a dynamic growth rate model to pre-2100 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) data. This model captures changes in GDP per capita and population using convergence ($\delta$) and decay rates ($\beta$). A Bayesian approach in Stan is utilized for robust model fitting, first approximating parameters through a simplified model before transitioning to full model fitting. The estimated rates for each SSP scenario beyond 2100 are provided, including visualizations of projected global population and GDP per capita for SSP2 and SSP5. More details are available in SI \ref{sec:sspext}.
