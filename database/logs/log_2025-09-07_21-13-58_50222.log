James sought an intuitive visualization for a distribution of possible damages comprising multiple components: base, cat, and growth. He considered using a histogram but noted that stacking bars wouldnâ€™t work as components shift the distribution rightward. I initially suggested layered density plots but James preferred highlighting the total while showing component breakdowns. We then shifted to using cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for visualization. After discussing issues with correctly aligning CDFs and understanding cumulative shifts, we concluded that CDFs should be represented as stacked bar plots to illustrate how each component contributes to the total. I provided R code to create this stacked bar visualization, ensuring the cumulative totals clearly represent the individual components stacked vertically.
