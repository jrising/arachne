James asked about how to perform a two-sample t-test in Julia. I provided two examples using the "TwoSampleTTest" function from the "HypothesisTests" package and the "ttest" function from the "StatsBase" package. I explained that the null hypothesis assumes the two samples have the same mean and the alternative hypothesis assumes they have different means.
