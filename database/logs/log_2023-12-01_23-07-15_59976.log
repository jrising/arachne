The conversation revolved around understanding the dataset that offers near-surface zonal and meridional total velocities and near-surface radial velocities, measured by High Frequency radars. The assistant clarified that "near-surface zonal and meridional total velocities" refer to the components of motion in different geographical directions. The zonal velocity represents the east-west component, while the meridional velocity represents the north-south component. The total velocity is the combination of these components and represents the complete velocity vector. On the other hand, the radial velocity is a component of the total velocity that is directly towards or away from the radar station. The assistant also emphasized that these velocities are measured within a certain height range close to the Earth's surface.
