In the conversation, James Rising responded to Khalique Rahman regarding his academic interests in environmental economics. James noted that while Khalique is a strong candidate, there are currently no funding opportunities available, anticipating the next round of applications later in the year. Khalique inquired about potential Master's programs, research assistantships, or teaching assistantships. James clarified that the Environmental Economics Master's program is self-funded, and suggested exploring related programs in the Economics or Applied Economics departments, but confirmed there are no TA or RA positions available for Master's students. He offered to discuss options further via a Zoom meeting link.
