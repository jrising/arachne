The study analyzed the impacts of climate change on various sectors, including drought and flooding, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, ecosystems, energy, labor productivity, heat/cold mortality, coastal impacts, trade, and missing and catastrophic risks. Results showed that current policies and high mitigation efforts have significant effects on each sector, with varying degrees of severity and divergence. Notably, high mitigation efforts can reduce damages and avoid costs in multiple sectors, such as drought and flooding, catastrophic risks, missing risks, and trade. The study emphasizes the need for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
