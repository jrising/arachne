This conversation provides a summary of a study on climate change damages across various sectors. The study examines the impacts of current policies and high mitigation efforts. The sectors analyzed include drought and inland flooding, agricultural losses, livestock and fisheries damages, ecosystem impacts, energy supply and demand costs, labor productivity losses, heat/cold mortality changes, coastal impacts, trade losses, missing risks, and catastrophic risks. The findings indicate that climate change significantly affects each sector, with varying degrees of severity and divergence. Notably, high mitigation efforts can effectively reduce the negative impacts in most sectors. Sectors with large uncertainties, such as catastrophic and missing risks, show potential for cost savings, highlighting the importance of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Detailed data can be found in the supplementary information provided.
