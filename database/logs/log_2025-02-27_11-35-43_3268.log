In a previous conversation, James encountered an error in Julia regarding the method `calc_domar_distribute_method1`, which was expecting a `Vector{String}` but received a `Vector{String15}`. He sought a solution to allow his function to accept various types of string vectors. In response, I suggested modifying the function's signature to use `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}`, enabling it to accept any string subtype. An example definition was provided to illustrate this change, allowing greater flexibility in the function's input types.
