In a discussion about Gnostic beliefs, James inquired about the gods as understood by the Gnostics, their views on Jesus, and the origins of the Demiurge and Jesus. Arachne explained that Gnosticism posited the existence of a supreme, unknowable God called the Unknown or the Invisible Spirit, a lesser divine being known as the Demiurge responsible for the physical universe, and intermediate divine beings called Aeons. Arachne clarified that Jesus was seen by some Gnostics as a divine figure who descended to impart knowledge and liberate humans from the control of the Demiurge, while others regarded him as a purely spiritual being. Arachne also described the pleroma as the spiritual realm of divine fullness above the material world, inhabited by Aeons, and emphasized the concept of levels of reality in Gnostic cosmology, with the pleroma representing the highest level and the material realm associated with the Demiurge as a lower and flawed level.
