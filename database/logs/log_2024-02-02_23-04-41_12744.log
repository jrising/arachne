James asked how to remove an item from a list returned by jQuery's `children()` method. The assistant explained that since the `children()` method returns a jQuery object, not a traditional JavaScript array, you can't directly use array methods like `shift()`. However, the assistant provided a solution to achieve the desired outcome by using `eq()` and `remove()` jQuery methods. When James asked if there was an easier way to get the first child of an element, the assistant suggested using the `:first-child` selector, which selects the first child element within its parent element. The assistant also provided an example of using the `filter()` method to select only element nodes. Finally, when James asked how to get the next item in the DOM after the current one, the assistant explained how to use the `next()` method to select the next sibling element, with the option to specify a selector. The assistant also mentioned that the `next()` method returns an empty jQuery object if there are no more siblings or non-element nodes between the elements.
