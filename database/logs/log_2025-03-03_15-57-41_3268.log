James inquired about efficiently identifying non-zero columns in a `dgCMatrix` row without converting it to a dense format. I confirmed that using `sparse_matrix[row, ]` would create a dense vector, which is inefficient. Instead, I provided an alternative method that directly accesses the internal structure of the `dgCMatrix`. The updated approach uses the pointers and column indices to retrieve non-zero column information without converting to dense format. I included a code snippet demonstrating this technique and invited further questions for clarification.
