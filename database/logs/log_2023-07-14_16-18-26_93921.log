In a previous conversation, James asked how to combine multiple PDFs into one with bookmarks/sections in Adobe Acrobat. The assistant provided a step-by-step guide to accomplish this. To combine the PDFs, James had to select "File -> Create -> Combine Files into a Single PDFâ€¦" and arrange the documents in the desired order before clicking "Combine." To add bookmarks, James had to open the combined PDF, select the area of text for each bookmark, and choose "Bookmarks -> Add Bookmark" or use the shortcut Ctrl+B. James could create a tiered bookmark system using the "Nested" option. The assistant advised James to save the document with bookmarks and verify software version and permissions.
