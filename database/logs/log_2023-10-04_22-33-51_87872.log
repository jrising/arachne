In a previous conversation, James asked for a political economy model relating resource extraction to development and poverty. The AI assistant provided five suggestions for locating such a model: searching academic research papers using keywords, exploring working papers and reports from international organizations, looking for relevant economic and development journals, consulting comprehensive books on political economy, and utilizing open access data and modeling platforms. The assistant reminded James to critically evaluate any model found, considering its limitations and applicability to the specific context being studied.
