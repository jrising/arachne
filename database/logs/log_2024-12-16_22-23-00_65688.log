James inquired about the concepts of representational justice and procedural justice, seeking to understand their differences. I explained that representational justice focuses on the equitable inclusion of diverse and marginalized groups in decision-making processes, ensuring their voices have a meaningful impact. It aims to correct power imbalances by diversifying leadership and institutions. In contrast, procedural justice pertains to the fairness and transparency of the processes leading to outcomes, emphasizing consistent application of rules and impartial decision-making. Both forms of justice are vital for social equity, addressing different dimensions of fairness: representational justice addresses who is included, while procedural justice deals with how decisions are made.
