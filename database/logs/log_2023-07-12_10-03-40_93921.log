James, a developer of the PAGE integrated assessment model of climate change, sought guidance on finding climate damage estimates that account for adaptation. The assistant provided several sources, including the Climate Impact Lab (CIL) which combines econometric analysis, climate modeling, and risk assessment to estimate local-level climate damage with adaptation considered. The National Climate Assessment (NCA) provides detailed sectoral impact projections for the United States. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) offers assessment reports that summarize literature on climate impacts, and the upcoming AR6 report may have updated information. The DICE model by William Nordhaus has an updated damage function, while the paper "Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production" by Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel explores a non-linear damage function. The assistant advised reviewing the regional, sectoral, and temporal scopes and equity weighting methods to ensure compatibility with the PAGE model.
