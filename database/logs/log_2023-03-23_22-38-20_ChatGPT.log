In a previous conversation, James asked how to write the units label for "millions of 2021 dollars" on a graph. The assistant advised using the abbreviation "M" to represent millions and the currency symbol for dollars. An example of the suggested label was provided as "Amount (M USD, 2021)" to indicate that the values on the graph are measured in millions of 2021 U.S. dollars.
