In a conversation with James, we discussed the approximate years associated with the common use of various technologies such as the telephone, automobile, personal computer, cell phone, newspaper, book, factory fabrics, radio, television, personal camera, telegram, and train transport. We also explored the timelines of significant scientific discoveries including evolution, genetics, plate tectonics, thermodynamics, and Newtonian mechanics. Furthermore, we examined other important incentives and discoveries that shaped the world between 1600 and today, such as the Industrial Revolution, Enlightenment, Scientific Revolution, electricity and electromagnetism, Information Age and digital revolution, medical advances, space exploration, and environmental awareness. Finally, we provided the approximate years associated with the inventions of the lightbulb, vaccines, antibiotics, birth control pill, home electrification, air conditioning, refrigerators, washing machines, and gas heat, highlighting the approximate timeframes when these technologies became widely available or adopted in households.
