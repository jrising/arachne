James encountered issues with overlaying tiles on a leaflet map in R Shiny compared to HTML generated by `gdal2tiles`. The assistant suggested checking the tile naming scheme, verifying the URL template, debugging tile requests, setting the `crossOrigin` property, and using debug logging. A complete code example was provided along with recommendations to use `gdal2tiles.py` with `--profile leaflet`, check the tile source and directory structure, and address local vs. remote tile serving issues. Following these steps should help diagnose and resolve the tile overlay problem in the R Shiny leaflet application.
