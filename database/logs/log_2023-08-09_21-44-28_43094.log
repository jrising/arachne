In a previous conversation, James asked about the terminology used in a mathematical treatise, specifically the terms for assumptions, main results, and side-results. The assistant provided the following information:
- Assumptions are often referred to as 'premises', 'conditions', 'axioms', or 'hypotheses'.
- Main results are traditionally called 'theorems', which are statements proven on the basis of previously established statements and accepted statements.
- Side-results are typically called 'lemmas' (minor results) or 'corollaries' (statements that follow readily from a previous statement).

These elements are used in mathematical treatises to formulate, explore, and prove complex mathematical concepts and relationships. The synthesis captures the key details while adhering to the 150 words limit.
