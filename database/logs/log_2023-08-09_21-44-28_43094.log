In a mathematical treatise, the assumptions are called premises, conditions, axioms, or hypotheses. The main results are referred to as theorems, while side-results are known as lemmas and corollaries. Lemmas are minor results that contribute to proving a theorem, while corollaries are bonus statements that follow from a previous statement. These elements are used to formulate, explore, and prove complex mathematical concepts and relationships.
