James asked about submitting a "perspective" article to an economics journal. Arachne provided a list of top economics journals that may accept such submissions, including The Journal of Economic Perspectives (JEP), The Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), Economic Policy, and Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA). Arachne recommended reaching out to the editorial team of the desired journal for guidance.
