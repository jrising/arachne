James sought advice on submitting a "perspective" article to an economics journal, despite the lack of a specific category for such articles in most economics journals. The assistant provided a list of top economics journals that do accept submissions akin to "perspective" articles, including The Journal of Economic Perspectives (JEP), The Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), Economic Policy, and Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA). The assistant emphasized the importance of reaching out to the editorial team of the desired journal before submission to express intention and get their viewpoint.
