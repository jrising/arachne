James requested information on standard linear interpolation in Python, and the AI assistant recommended using `numpy.interp()` for simple 1D interpolation. The assistant provided a code example demonstrating how to interpolate values for new points based on known data points. It also noted that interpolation functions become more complex for multi-dimensional data, suggesting the `scipy.interpolate` module for 2D or ND interpolation.
