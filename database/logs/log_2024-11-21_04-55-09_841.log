The discussion focused on organizing calendar management for the Communications and Development teams, emphasizing the maintenance of separate calendars with shared relevant event information. Key stewardship activities were outlined, including quarterly donor shoutouts in the IMT newsletter and on LinkedIn, possibly enhanced by engaging interviews. A biannual newsletter for philanthropic funders was proposed, prioritizing personalization through YAMM rather than Mailchimp. The conversation also highlighted the need for Regional Cohort touchpoints and EOY impact report outreach, with an annual check-in organized by sbk to be included on the calendar, despite not having a direct communications role. Overall, the goal is to improve coordination and enhance relationship-building efforts with funders and partners.
