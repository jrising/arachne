James inquired about comparing two text pieces on a character-by-character level to identify differences. I recommended using a Python script with the `difflib` module for detailed comparisons. He later requested a PHP solution, and I provided a PHP script that performs character comparisons. James expressed the need to detect entire word additions, deletions, and modifications, with the ability to highlight changes in color. In response, I introduced the `fine-diff` library, offering a PHP script example that differentiates and displays changes by wrapping added text in colored spans while keeping the original text intact.
