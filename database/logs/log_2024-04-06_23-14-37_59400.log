James inquired about 2-bit quantization in machine learning models for compressing weight size. Arachne explained that 2-bit quantization limits weight values to four levels, leading to reduced storage and computational costs with some loss in precision. The decision to increase quantization bits depends on trade-offs between model size, speed, and accuracy. Factors like hardware constraints and energy usage influence this decision, with more bits offering greater precision but higher requirements. Arachne advised running experiments to determine the best quantization for specific use cases.
