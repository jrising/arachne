James inquired about the expectations for a subcommittee of the IMT's board finance committee focused on fundraising. In response, I outlined key responsibilities, including developing and implementing fundraising strategies, ensuring stewardship and relationship building with donors, maintaining financial oversight and accountability, and providing regular reporting to the finance committee and board. The need for balancing short-term initiatives with long-term financial sustainability was emphasized, alongside the importance of understanding the organization's mission and fundraising landscape.
