James inquired about a book discussing "hard problems" that used a distinct term for problems lacking well-defined solutions. I identified "wicked problems" as the term he was likely referencing. Wicked problems are characterized by their complexity and the absence of clear, definitive resolutions, often arising in social policy and planning contexts. James's prompt led to an informative response detailing the nature of wicked problems.
