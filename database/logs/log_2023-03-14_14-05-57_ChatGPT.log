In a previous conversation, James inquired about determining the contribution of a region to a state within the IMPLAN model. The AI explained that imposing a -100% shock on each sector in the region would not accurately capture its contribution. Instead, the AI suggested using the IMPLAN model's built-in analytical tools or methodologies like location quotient analysis. Later, James asked about estimating the contribution of a region to the whole economy using MRIO within IMPLAN. The AI provided general steps, including setting up the MRIO model, running it, analyzing the multipliers, and interpreting the results. Finally, James inquired about obtaining multipliers representing all industries in a region. The AI explained how to use the "Regional Impact" analysis in IMPLAN to generate multipliers for all industries in a region, along with the subsequent analysis and interpretation steps.
