James was initially having trouble getting a basic setup with Passenger to work for his Flask app. The error logs indicated an issue with the headers. The assistant provided steps to identify and fix the problem, including configuring the .htaccess file, adding the proper shebang in the passenger_wsgi.py file, modifying the Flask application code, and restarting the web server. James confirmed that Passenger was now working, but encountered an "Incomplete response received from application" error when importing the Flask application into the Passenger script. The assistant suggested checking the proper import of the Flask app, verifying that the app runs correctly, checking for any logged Passenger errors, and ensuring that the Flask app completes all requests. Further information was requested to provide additional assistance.
