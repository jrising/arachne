James is experiencing issues with setting up a Flask app with Passenger. Initially, he was getting an "End of script output before headers" error, which was resolved by properly configuring the .htaccess file and the passenger_wsgi.py script. However, he is now encountering an "Incomplete response received from application" error when importing the Flask application into the Passenger script. The assistant provides guidance on checking the Flask app import, ensuring the Flask app runs correctly, reviewing Passenger logs for errors, and ensuring all requests are completed by the Flask app.
