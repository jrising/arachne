Sourav Mukherjee from India expressed interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in marine-related fields under James Rising's supervision, highlighting his academic background in biotechnology and research experience in marine ecosystems. James noted the alignment of Sourav's interests with his research and suggested that Sourav consider the Ph.D. programs in Marine Policy or natural sciences. He cautioned about limited funding availability and encouraged Sourav to mention his work in the statement of purpose. However, recognizing the bioscience focus, James decided it would be more appropriate for Sourav to be directed to Dr. Xinfeng for specialized guidance, crafting a response to redirect Sourav accordingly.
