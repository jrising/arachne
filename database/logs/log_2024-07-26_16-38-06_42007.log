James sought guidance on setting up conditional formatting in Excel to adjust the background color of one column based on the values in another column. The assistant provided step-by-step instructions, including selecting the column, creating a custom rule with a formula referencing the other column, setting the desired format, and applying the rule. An example using the word "High" in column B to dictate the background color change in column A was given. The assistant encouraged James to ask for more help if needed.
