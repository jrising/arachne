In the conversation, James discussed an email from Arqam Tariq regarding his interest in transferring from the PhD Public Policy program to the PhD Environmental Economics (EE) program at the University of Delaware. Arqam inquired about funding eligibility and course credits from the Biden School. James emphasized the necessity of securing funding before initiating the transfer and suggested prompt discussions with Professor Moffat and the Program Director to explore funding options. He also proposed developing a personalized course plan to leverage Arqam's existing Biden courses for the EE program, ensuring a smooth academic transition. James offered to further discuss this via a scheduled Zoom meeting link.
