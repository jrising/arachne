James was having trouble with a `mutate()` call using `across` in dplyr as the data was not being changed. The assistant provided several possible reasons for this issue, including missing the `%>%` operator, using the incorrect data frame name, typos in variable names, incorrect function syntax, using a non-existent variable name, or specifying incorrect variables in the `across` argument. The assistant also suggested checking the structure of the data frame before and after the `mutate()` call to see if any changes occurred.
