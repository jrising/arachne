James provided a table categorizing data for various activities in Delaware's ocean and bay, and requested edits for clarity. Arachne adjusted the category definitions to ensure clarity and consistency. The revised categories include Physical Data, Resource Data, Usage Data, Management Data, Economic Data, and Future/Proposed. Arachne also made specific suggestions for each category in the table, such as including habitat suitability, key species ecosystems, and oceanic parameters for Physical Data, and revenue, operation costs, and employment numbers for Economic Data. Arachne recommended considering the inclusion of social data in the future. Overall, James received clarified category descriptions and an edited table to use in the report for Delaware's government.
