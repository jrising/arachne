The EU ETS utilizes benchmarking to allocate free permits based on top performers in sectors/subsectors, aiming to prevent carbon leakage. Through benchmarks and historical activity levels, installations receive allowances subject to a cross-sectoral correction factor if necessary. Adjustments are possible for significant production changes. This method incentivizes efficiency, encourages green innovation, and allows efficient installations to trade excess allowances while pushing less efficient ones to improve or purchase extra allowances to meet emissions standards.
