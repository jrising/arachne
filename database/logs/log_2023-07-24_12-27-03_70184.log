In a previous conversation, James asked if there were ways to reduce the size of an ESRI shapefile in QGIS other than simplifying polygons. Arachne listed several methods, such as reducing attribute data, converting data types, spatially subsetting the data, resampling rasters, file compression, and file conversion. Each method was explained and their trade-offs were mentioned. Arachne highlighted the importance of considering specific needs before implementing any of these methods.
