In this conversation, James asks if there are ways to reduce the size of an ESRI shapefile in QGIS other than simplying polygons. Arachne provides several methods to reduce the size of the shapefile, including reducing attribute data, converting data types, spatially subsetting the data, resampling rasters, file compression, and file conversion. Arachne also advises considering the trade-offs of each method before implementation.
