James sought assistance with the upgrade of an old version of MediaWiki, encountering an issue with the missing "media_actor" table. Arachne provided guidance on the steps to follow for the upgrade, including backing up the database, downloading the new MediaWiki version, and running the upgrade script. Arachne also suggested checking for extensions or custom code that may be causing the issue and seeking further help from the MediaWiki community if needed.
