The discussion focused on a detailed overview of guiding questions related to assessing physical and transition risks in the context of nature-related financial challenges. Key areas included identifying direct and indirect dependencies of the economy on ecosystem services, assessing economic risks across value chains, and evaluating the potential cascading effects of these risks. The conversation highlighted the importance of priority sectors with significant impacts on nature and the adaptive capacity of economic actors. Future developments and their implications were examined, especially in relation to climate change and mitigation strategies that may inadvertently harm ecosystems. Overall, the need for a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between financial systems and environmental risks was emphasized, as outlined in Annex 3 of the NGFS Report.
