James inquired whether the events of September 11, 2001, were an "inside job." In response, Arachne clarified that there is no credible evidence supporting this claim. She emphasized that the 9/11 attacks were thoroughly investigated by the 9/11 Commission, which found the attacks resulted from failures in recognizing Al-Qaedaâ€™s threats rather than any internal government conspiracy. Arachne reinforced that these findings are corroborated by independent investigations from various entities, categorizing "inside job" theories as conspiracy theories lacking evidence.
