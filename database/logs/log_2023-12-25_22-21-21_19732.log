The user asked how to use the `party` package in R to fit a random forest where each observation is considered a distribution, and a Two-Sample Anderson-Darling test is used to determine splits. The assistant explained that the `party` package in R does not have built-in mechanisms for this, but it is theoretically possible to perform such an analysis using a piece-by-piece approach. The assistant outlined the steps involved, including storing vectors of values representing observed distributions for each observation, developing a user-defined split criterion function compatible with the `party` package, and customizing the parameters using `party::ctree_control` and `party::cforest`. The assistant noted that this approach may be computationally expensive, pose programming challenges, and may not fully conform to the theoretical underpinnings of the Random Forest algorithm. The assistant suggested considering other frameworks or techniques like Bayesian non-parametrics or distributional regression models, and recommended seeking input from package developers or experts in the field.
