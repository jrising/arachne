James asked for guidance on how to finish making an apple-pear tart after preparing the crust, filling, and glaze ahead of time and refrigerating them. The assistant advised James to cover the edges of the pre-baked crust to prevent burning, and to bake the filling in the tart to warm it up and meld the flavors, while preventing it from drying out by covering it with parchment paper or foil. The assistant also suggested using the extra pie crust to make decorative shapes to place on top of the tart, and recommended baking them beforehand for added crunch and sweetness. Finally, the assistant advised James to brush the glaze over the warm tart after it comes out of the oven and to let it cool before serving.
