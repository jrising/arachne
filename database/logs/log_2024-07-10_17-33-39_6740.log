James sought guidance on integrating a slider in an R Shiny app to adjust discount rates while visualizing their distribution in the dataset. Arachne suggested using a histogram or density plot alongside the slider, providing code examples using Shiny and Plotly for interactive plotting. The solution involved setting up a slider to select discount rates within the dataset range and displaying a histogram that highlights the selected rate. Arachne emphasized adjusting parameters to suit specific data needs, enabling users to grasp the relationship between their selection and the dataset's discount rate distribution.
