James asked if Linux's `find` command can find files that are older than a given date. Arachne explained that the `-mtime` parameter can be used to search for files based on their modification time. By providing a negative value with the `-mtime` option, files older than a specific date can be found. Arachne provided an example command structure and explained the usage of each component. James was satisfied with the explanation and can now use the `find` command to locate files older than a certain date.
