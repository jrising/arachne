The discussion began with an exploration of government policy in Brazil's coffee sector, particularly in the context of climate change impacts on coffee production. The key article, "Effects of the Climate Change Scenario on Coffea canephora Production in Brazil," suggested that climate change could render many regions unsuitable for coffee cultivation, highlighting the need for government policies to develop adaptation strategies. Potential government actions could include investing in research for climate-resilient coffee varieties, providing financial support for adaptation practices, and ensuring stable market conditions. Overall, the discourse emphasized the importance of targeted governmental intervention to support the coffee sector's resilience amidst climate volatility.
