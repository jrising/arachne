James inquired about approximating cluster-robust standard errors through bootstrapping. I outlined a step-by-step process involving identification of clusters, resampling clusters with replacement, estimating parameters for each bootstrap sample, and calculating standard errors from the bootstrapped estimates. He raised a concern that robust SEs correct for correlation within clusters and questioned whether only some points within each cluster should be included due to this correlation. I clarified that while itâ€™s true that robust SEs address within-cluster correlation, bootstrapping involves resampling entire clusters to preserve the data's structure. This method captures both correlation and independence across clusters, allowing for proper calculation of standard errors while reflecting the original data's correlation dynamics.
