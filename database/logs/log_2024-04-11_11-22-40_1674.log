James inquired about the reasons behind the EU ETS choosing benchmarking over grandfathering to avoid perverse incentives. The assistant explained that grandfathering, which allocates emission allowances based on historical emissions, can create perverse incentives by rewarding high-emitting entities. In contrast, benchmarking distributes allowances based on performance standards to encourage emissions reductions and technological innovation. This shift aims to promote cleaner technologies and practices, incentivizing firms to achieve greater efficiency and competitiveness within the EU ETS framework.
