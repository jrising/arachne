In the conversation, James inquires about the "incidental parameters problem" in panel regression, where both a global constant and individual intercepts cannot be estimated due to perfect collinearity. I explain that this issue arises in fixed effects models but not in random effects models, where individual-specific effects are treated as random variables. This allows for the inclusion of a global intercept without collinearity issues. James then asks about incorporating demographic effects in a random effects model, to which I confirm that demographics can be included alongside the global intercept without facing the same issues as OLS or fixed effects. I highlight the benefit of improving model explanatory power and mitigating omitted variable bias, cautioning about the assumption of independence between random effects and predictors.
