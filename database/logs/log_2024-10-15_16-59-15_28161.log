In a discussion about a call for proposals titled "Exploring Climate Cooling," James expressed interest in submitting a modeling study that incorporates the political economy of geoengineering and its effects on climate tipping points. He proposed extending the META integrated assessment model to include stratospheric aerosol injection (SRM) and ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR), preferring a scenarios-based approach to assess total risks without including endogenous costs. In response, a detailed outline for a 1-pager pitch was developed, emphasizing key components from the call, such as the scientific framework, technical metrics, societal aspects, and governance issues. The pitch highlights the unique contribution to understanding climate risks and suggests identifying overarching research questions related to the interaction of SRM and CDR with climate tipping points. The importance of international collaboration and policy implications was also underscored.
