James is asking for guidance on requesting data on Highly Migratory Species (HMS) and MRIP recreational angler surveys from a NOAA official. The parameters of the request are determined to be reasonable: spatial extent in Delaware waters and temporal extent back to 2008 with sub-annual data. The fields for the HMS dataset include species name, catch location, date of catch, catch method, weight and length of catch, and tagging data if available. The MRIP recreational angler surveys include fields like angler's ID, date and duration of fishing trip, target species, number of each species caught and released, fishing mode, and fishing area.
