James requested guidance on what parameters to provide to a NOAA (NMFS) official for data on Highly Migratory Species (HMS) and MRIP recreational angler surveys. The assistant confirmed that the parameters, namely Delaware waters as the spatial extent and data from 2008 with sub-annual resolution as the temporal extent, were reasonable. The assistant also provided a description of the fields typically included in these datasets. For HMS data, fields such as species name, catch location, date of catch, catch method, weight, length, and tagging data (if available) were mentioned. For MRIP surveys, fields like angler ID, date and duration of fishing trip, target species, numbers caught and released, fishing mode, and fishing area were identified. The assistant advised James to check if these fields met his requirements and suggested discussing additional data needs with the NOAA official if necessary.
