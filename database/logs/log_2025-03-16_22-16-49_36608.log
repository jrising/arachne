James sought advice on providing a smooth speaking experience using the web SpeechSynthesis API with a streaming response that could potentially deliver inputs character by character. I suggested modifying his code to read from the stream in real-time, thereby processing smaller chunks of text as they arrive. I provided a code snippet that includes logic for managing speech synthesis and control flow. When James clarified that the input often comes character by character, I revised the approach to implement a buffering system to collect characters until a certain length or punctuation mark was reached before synthesizing speech. This allows for a smoother, more coherent speaking experience, accommodating the nature of the input stream.
