James asked about the meaning of a faculty appointment described as 50% research and 50% teaching. Arachne explained that this indicates an equal division of time and responsibilities between research and teaching. Research responsibilities may include independent research projects, securing funding, and supervising graduate students. Teaching responsibilities may involve designing and delivering courses, advising students, and participating in departmental tasks. Arachne also provided a general guideline for the number of courses that a 50% teaching appointment would imply, suggesting around 2 courses per semester based on a typical full-time teaching load of 4 courses. However, the specific teaching load can vary and it is best to consult with the department or supervisor for precise information.
