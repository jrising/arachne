In a prior conversation, James discussed writing a grant proposal focused on the economic and fiscal risks of climate damage to the UK, as outlined in a comprehensive scoping document. The discussion highlighted the intent to produce UK-level climate damage scenarios, particularly within a macroeconomic framework, incorporating various existing models and datasets. Key research questions revolved around understanding macroeconomic impacts, fiscal implications of climate damages, and evaluating adaptation options. James sought assistance in drafting the objective section of the proposal to emphasize the development of a robust modeling framework, the assessment of fiscal impacts, and the promotion of evidence-based policy. The proposed approach aims to enhance the UK's resilience to climate change and supports collaboration across government and international entities for effective adaptation strategies.
