James inquired about the interpretation of musical notes marked flat and the repetition of those markings, as well as the meaning of a "C" with a vertical line through it at the beginning of a piece. I clarified that accidentals apply to all subsequent notes within the same measure unless altered by another accidental, while the "C" with a line signifies cut time (2/2 time signature). This information aids in understanding music notation, enhancing James's musical literacy.
