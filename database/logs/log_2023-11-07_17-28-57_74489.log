The methodology section of the report describes the process of estimating the macroeconomic effects of climate change. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and eight critical papers were identified. The research team implemented 61 unique models from these papers, collecting meta-data under 11 distinct headings to assess model sophistication and data quality. The models were estimated using econometric methods and high-quality weather and economic output data. The limitations of the work include uncertainties arising from model selection and assumptions, data availability and quality, simplifications in the models, uncertainties in future projections, the scope of analysis, international trade dynamics, and the need for further validation and evaluation. The methodology does not explicitly account for external factors and systemic interdependencies, epistemic uncertainty, regional variations, or non-market impacts of climate change. Recognizing these limitations is important for interpreting the results and improving future analyses.
