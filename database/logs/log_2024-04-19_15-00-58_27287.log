James inquired about using `groupby` in pandas to return multiple values similarly to the `reframe` function in dplyr. After explaining the process with a sample DataFrame and a custom interpolation function, James was guided on how to use `groupby` and `apply` to interpolate values for each group based on a new range of years. Recommendations were provided to customize the interpolation method and the range of years according to specific needs.
