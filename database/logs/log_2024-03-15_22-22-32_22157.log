James inquired about incorporating spatial data lookup into neural networks. I explained that traditional nodes in neural networks do not directly access external datasets. Suggestions included preprocessing data to include spatial information, using spatial tensors as additional features, or exploring Differentiable Programming for complex functions. I cautioned about model complexity and the risk of overfitting when integrating non-standard functionalities into neural networks.
