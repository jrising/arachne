The extracted information from the document includes four activities: Waste Dump Sites, Submarine Cables, Construction of Undersea Electricity Transmission Hub and Subsea High-voltage Transmission Line, and Utilization of Substation Points for Small-scale Development. The Waste Dump Sites are discontinued dump sites that may still pose challenges for development activities. The Submarine Cables consist of both operational and non-operational lines, with a need for identification and charting of submerged cables. Plans for constructing an Undersea Electricity Transmission Hub and Subsea High-voltage Transmission Line have been proposed, but it is unclear if construction has begun. The Utilization of Substation Points for Small-scale Development involves using multiple small substation points for smaller-scale projects. The table provides details about the current status, spatial extent, potential expansion/changes, stakeholders, sources, and other notes for each activity. The document does not specify the temporal patterns for any of the activities.
