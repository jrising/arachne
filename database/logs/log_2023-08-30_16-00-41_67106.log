In a conversation about a reviewer's comment on a paper presenting an econometric approach to estimating crop yields, the reviewer asks for a clearer articulation of the assumptions and a comparison with process-based crop modelling. The reviewer specifically mentions the "contingency of robustness" and suggests that a more detailed presentation of contingencies would improve confidence in the study's results. The phrase "contingency of robustness" refers to the idea that the reliability and strength of the results depend on factors such as the quality of underlying data and assumptions. The reviewer is asking for an explicit acknowledgment and discussion of these dependencies to understand potential limitations and to compare the new approach with the established method.
