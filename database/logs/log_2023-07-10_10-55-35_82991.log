In this conversation, James inquired about the order of predictors in an ANOVA for variance decomposition. The assistant clarified that in a standard ANOVA, the order of predictors does not affect the results, as the analysis focuses on the variability within and between groups. However, in a Hierarchical or Sequential ANOVA, the order of predictors does matter. This type of ANOVA allows for an assessment of the change in explained variance contributed by each predictor in a specific sequence. The assistant advised James that if he is conducting a hierarchical/sequential ANOVA, the order of predictors can impact the outcome, as each predictor's unique contribution is evaluated after considering the effect of preceding predictors. Ultimately, the assistant emphasized that for a typical ANOVA, predictor order is insignificant, but it does play a role in hierarchical or sequential ANOVAs.
