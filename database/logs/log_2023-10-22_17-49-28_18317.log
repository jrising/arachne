James requested estimates of the time division for various career pathways starting with an assistant professorship at an R1 university. Arachne provided a table with rough guidelines for each profile, including allocations for research, grant-writing, teaching, advising, university service, public service, and private work. Arachne emphasized that these were general estimates and could vary depending on institutions, regions, sectors, and personal career choices. She also suggested considering other tasks such as networking, mentoring, advocacy, public speaking, and professional development. Lastly, Arachne noted that the "private work" category could include various sideline projects that may not neatly fit into the other categories.
