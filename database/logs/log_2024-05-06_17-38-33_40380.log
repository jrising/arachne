James inquired about interpreting Poisson regression coefficients for daily temperature and case count data. The assistant explained that in this context, a positive coefficient indicates an increase in the log of expected cases per day with temperature, while a negative coefficient suggests a decrease. To obtain a more intuitive understanding of the impact, James could exponentiate the coefficient. The assistant emphasized checking for the linearity assumption, potential overdispersion in the data, and suggested considering a negative binomial model if needed.
