James inquired about transitioning the Green Lease Leaders (GLL) program from a free application model to a tiered pay-for-application system. I outlined a comprehensive plan involving market analysis, financial modeling, defining application tiers, and developing corporate sponsorship options. We discussed introducing the shift to members, recommending a clear communication plan that includes a detailed announcement email, webinars, FAQs, and personalized outreach. I emphasized the importance of transparency regarding the $1,000 application fee to ensure members understand the value and benefits of the new model. Engagement campaigns and feedback mechanisms were suggested to address concerns, alongside a transition period allowing members to adjust. Overall, the goal is to enhance sustainability support while effectively managing the implementation of the new pricing structure.
