In a previous conversation, James asked about the name for economic models used to estimate the value of an asset from its attributes, to which I responded that they are called "hedonic pricing models" or "hedonic regression models." James then inquired about the biggest questions in the field of behavioral economics that are currently addressed with econometrics. I provided a list of significant questions, including bounded rationality, time inconsistency and present bias, social preferences, prospect theory and reference dependence, overconfidence and optimism, nudging and choice architecture, and the role of emotions in decision-making. I explained that econometrics is used to analyze data and test hypotheses related to these questions, and it helps in estimating causal relationships, testing theoretical predictions, and informing the development of behavioral models and policy interventions.
