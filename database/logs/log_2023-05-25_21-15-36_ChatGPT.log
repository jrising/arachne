The discussion focused on James's request to create a draft proposal for a "Coastal Barometer," a tool to monitor the economic health of the coastal economy in Delaware. The conversation explored the dynamism of the coastal economy, the risks and opportunities it faces, and the need for a holistic understanding of its health. The proposed Coastal Barometer would provide a regularly updated dashboard of indices on the coastal economy's health, capturing its connections to the broader state and national economies. It would empower coastal community officials in infrastructure development and land-use decisions, while also guiding future sustainable and inclusive development.
