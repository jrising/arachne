The conversation focused on the proposal for a "Coastal Barometer" that would serve as a tool to monitor and understand the economic health of Delaware's coastal economy. The discussion highlighted the dynamic nature of the coastal economy, including both risks and opportunities. Economic risks were identified as flooding, sea level rise, shifting tourism behaviors, and climate change impacts on the natural environment. Economic opportunities were noted in the demand for beautiful environments and businesses adapting to the changing needs of an aging population. The proposal emphasized the need for a resilient economy that can mitigate risks and seize opportunities, and suggested that methods from sustainable development and inclusive accounting can provide a basis for capturing the economic basis for future prosperity. The Coastal Barometer was described as a dashboard of indices that would provide a comprehensive snapshot of the coastal economy's health, including its connections to the broader state and national economies. By making this data readily available, the Coastal Barometer would enable better infrastructure development and informed land-use decisions. It was presented as a critical instrument for sustainable and inclusive development.
