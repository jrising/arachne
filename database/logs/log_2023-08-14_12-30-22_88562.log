The conversation was a request to create a digest of the project objectives for a grant proposal to the DOE. The project, named EMPOWER, focuses on enabling multi-disciplinary pathways in offshore wind education and research. The conversation discussed the Community Benefits Plan (CBP), which aims to engage the offshore wind workforce and coastal stakeholder communities. The CBP includes strategies for creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, addressing energy equity, and investing in America's workforce. It emphasizes integrating diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and accessibility. The plan involves developing fellowship, scholarship, and mentorship programs, as well as establishing a community advisory board and conducting public information sessions. Additionally, the CBP addresses environmental justice concerns, promotes educational outreach, and supports the growth of America's offshore wind industry. The conversation also provided a detailed breakdown of the tasks and milestones involved in implementing the project.
