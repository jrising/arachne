Based on a reading about climate change, the user requested multiple-choice questions to evaluate if their students had done the reading. The assistant provided a question asking about the main reason for the increase in global mean surface air temperature and sea level, and decrease in snow pack since the Industrial Revolution, with the correct answer being the increase in ambient concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O due to anthropogenic activities. The assistant then suggested several additional questions, covering topics such as the greenhouse effect, the role of greenhouse gases in the Earth's energy balance, the impact of greenhouse gases on warming, the primary reason for sea level rise, and the effect of CO2 concentration on ocean acidity. The user was asked to choose the questions that best fit their evaluation needs.
