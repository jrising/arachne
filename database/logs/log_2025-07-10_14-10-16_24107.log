James inquired about net metering in Philadelphia, specifically whether generating more power than needed could lead to earning money. I explained that Pennsylvania's net metering allows credits for excess energy fed into the grid, primarily aiming to offset energy bills rather than create profit. While excess generation can reduce bills to zero, credits are typically compensated at a lower "avoidance rate" at the end of the year. Therefore, the strategic goal should be to balance energy production with consumption, reducing expenses rather than expecting significant income. I recommended staying updated on current policies through the utility or state agency.
