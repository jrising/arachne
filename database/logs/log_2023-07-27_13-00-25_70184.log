In the previous conversation, James asked about configuring UFW to allow SSH connections while connected to a VPN. The assistant provided step-by-step instructions, including determining the VPN's IP address range, enabling UFW, defaulting UFW to deny all incoming connections, allowing SSH connections only from the VPN's IP range, and checking the UFW configuration. The assistant also mentioned that relying solely on VPN access might be excessive and could cause inconvenience if SSH access is needed from a different network. Alternatively, hardening SSH and appropriately configuring the VPN were suggested. The assistant offered to provide guidelines on VPN and SSH hardening if desired.
