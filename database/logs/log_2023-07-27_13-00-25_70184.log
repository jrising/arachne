James wants to set up a server with remote SSH access and a level of security by configuring UFW to allow SSH connections only when connected to his VPN. The assistant provides step-by-step instructions on how to achieve this, including determining the VPN's IP address range, enabling UFW, setting the default UFW to deny all incoming connections, allowing SSH connections only from the VPN's IP range, and checking the UFW configuration. The assistant also advises James on the potential inconvenience and alternative approaches to solely relying on VPN access for SSH, and offers to provide guidelines on VPN and SSH hardening.
