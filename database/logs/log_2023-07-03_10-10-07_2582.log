In this conversation, James asked about the meaning of "implementation science" and "decision science for policy makers" for his grant proposal. The assistant explained that implementation science refers to strategies for incorporating research findings into healthcare practice and policy, while decision science for policy makers involves interdisciplinary approaches to evaluate factors that inform policy decisions. The assistant also suggested that in the context of the grant proposal, these terms could relate to developing tools or models to help NGOs and local community staff make informed decisions in response to changing health conditions and early-warning system signals.
