In a previous conversation, James asked about the approximate cost of operating an 8 CPU computer at 100% capacity in the US. The assistant provided a rough estimate by considering the power consumption of the computer and the average cost of electricity in the US. It was estimated that a high-end workstation with 8 CPUs might consume around 1.5 kilowatts and the average electricity cost in the US is about 13.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Assuming the computer runs 24 hours a day, the estimated annual cost came out to be $1,710. However, the assistant emphasized that actual costs may vary based on specific computer systems, local electricity rates, and CPU usage. It also pointed out that modern computers often have energy-efficient power management features.
