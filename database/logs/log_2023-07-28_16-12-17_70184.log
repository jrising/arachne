The conversation was about estimating the cost of operating an 8 CPU computer at 100% capacity, considering the power consumption and average cost of electricity in the US. It was determined that, based on a high-end workstation with 8 CPUs consuming 1.5 kW and the average electricity cost of 13.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, the rough annual cost would be approximately $1,710. However, it was noted that actual costs may vary depending on specific factors such as the computer system, local electricity rates, and CPU usage.
