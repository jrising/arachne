The transition from wood fire to central heating or water heaters in houses in the United States occurred gradually over time, with the specific timeline varying depending on factors such as regional availability of fuel sources, technological advancements, and individual preferences. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, wood-burning stoves were common, but in the late 19th century, the introduction of coal-fired furnaces marked the shift towards central heating systems. From the mid-20th century onwards, there was a gradual transition to other energy sources such as oil, natural gas, and electricity for central heating. For water heaters, the transition from wood-fired systems to gas and electric water heaters also occurred during the same timeframe. It's important to note that the transition was not uniform across the country, and some households still use wood stoves today.
