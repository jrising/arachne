In a previous conversation, James inquired about managing API requests in Python while adhering to a limit of 15 requests per minute. I provided a solution involving a `RateLimiter` class that tracks timestamps and imposes delays to prevent exceeding the limit. James then asked about handling different requests with variable budget impacts. I suggested modifications to the rate limiter to account for different request costs, implementing a budget management system that checks the total used budget within a specified time window. This updated approach enables dynamic control of API usage based on each requestâ€™s cost, enhancing granularity in budgeting for API calls.
