James sought guidance on creating a website speech recognition system that listens for speech, processes input after three seconds of silence, and resumes listening. I outlined a solution using the Web Speech API in JavaScript, detailing steps for setup, including creating a `SpeechRecognition` object, configuring recognition parameters, and handling key events like `onresult`, `onspeechend`, and `onerror`. I provided an example implementation in HTML that demonstrated how to start listening, process the results, and restart listening using a silence timer. I emphasized the importance of non-continuous mode and error handling in the process and noted browser compatibility, particularly with Chrome, for optimal functionality.
