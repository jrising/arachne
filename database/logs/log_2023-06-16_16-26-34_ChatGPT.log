In a conversation about grant management and budgeting, James asked for help decoding his grant manager's response regarding Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC) and Indirect Costs (IDC). The AI assistant explained that direct costs are expenses directly tied to the project, while indirect costs are incurred for common objectives. The grant manager mentioned using MTDC as the IDC base, which means calculating indirect costs as a percentage (15%) of the direct costs after certain exemptions. The assistant clarified that tuition fees, although not included in MTDC, are usually considered a direct cost. The coverage of the student's tuition would depend on the specific terms of the grant. The assistant advised James to consult the grant's terms or directly ask the grant manager for confirmation. James thanked the assistant for the clarification and expressed gratitude for the assistance.
