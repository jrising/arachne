The discussion centered around decoding grant management terms related to budgeting, specifically Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC) and Indirect Costs (IDC). It was explained that direct costs are expenses directly tied to a specific project, while indirect costs are incurred for common objectives. The MTDC base is the total direct costs minus certain exemptions. The grant manager considered applying the 15% rate to total direct costs, even those exempted in MTDC calculations, depending on the funder's terms. The inclusion of tuition fees in the budget and whether they would be covered by the grant were also discussed.
