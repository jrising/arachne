In a previous conversation, James asked if sediment is part of bathymetry. Arachne clarified that bathymetry is the study of underwater depth, while sediment refers to naturally occurring material. However, sediment can influence bathymetric measurements and features over time. Arachne explained that sediment can alter the depth and shape of the underwater terrain, and mentioned the concept of "sediment bathymetry" to analyze sediment distribution alongside bathymetric data. The discussion highlights the importance of considering sediment in studies of underwater landscapes and the potential for sediment to shape bathymetric features.
