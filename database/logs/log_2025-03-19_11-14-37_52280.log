In the conversation, James Rising received an email from Jingwen Jiao inquiring about the status of her Ph.D. application in Environmental Economics at the University of Delaware. Jingwen expressed strong interest in the program and mentioned offers from several other universities requiring timely decisions. James requested assistance in drafting a professional response. The draft included an apology for the delayed response, notification of very limited funding leading to no available slots for Jingwen, and an invitation to discuss further via Zoom. The response conveyed professionalism while addressing Jingwen's situation efficiently.
