James shared descriptions of structural modeling choices for calculating the social cost of carbon in IAMs, including model uncertainty, Earth system dynamics, preferences, distributional weighting, learning, limited substitutability, persistent damages, and climate and damage tipping points. He requested tooltips for these options, along with parameters of uncertainty and other modeling choices, to include in a JavaScript dictionary for a webtool. I provided concise descriptions for each option, highlighting their key impacts on the SCC calculation and other modeling considerations. The JavaScript object I created mapped each option to relevant tooltip information, tailored for user understanding in the webtool development process.
