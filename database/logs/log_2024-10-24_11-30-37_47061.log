In a previous conversation, James inquired about the inverse of a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function. I provided the mathematical form of the CRRA utility function, differentiated for cases where the coefficient of relative risk aversion (\(\theta\)) is equal to or not equal to one. For \(\theta \neq 1\), the inverse was derived as \(c = \left(U(c)(1-\theta) + 1\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\theta}}\), while for \(\theta = 1\), the inverse is expressed as \(c = e^{U(c)}\). I encouraged further questions or requests for detailed explanations if needed.
