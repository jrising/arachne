The discussion explores the difference between econometrics and machine learning, using examples in both general and environmental economics. Econometrics is focused on estimating and interpreting causal relationships (beta-hat problems), while machine learning aims to build accurate predictive models (y-hat problems). In environmental economics, econometrics is used to estimate the impacts of environmental policies on outcomes such as emissions, while machine learning is employed to predict environmental conditions or metrics for informed decision-making.
