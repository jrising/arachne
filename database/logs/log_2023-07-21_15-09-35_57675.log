The discussion revolved around determining the standard error (SE) of the difference between two normal distributions with a mean of 0 and the same standard error (SE). The assistant provided a formula for calculating the SE of the difference, which is √(2σ^2), where σ represents the standard error of each distribution. The synthesis emphasizes the key details of the prompts and the outcome, highlighting the formula for calculating the SE and the specific value of √2 as the multiplication factor for σ.
