James encountered an AttributeError while trying to query a record by id using SQLAlchemy's `engine.connect()`. I explained that the `Connection` object does not have a `query` method for ORM operations and suggested using a `Session` object instead. The `execute()` method is for raw SQL statements with `Connection`, while the ORM query API with `Session` allows for more object-oriented interactions. I provided code examples for both approaches and mentioned the modernized approach using SQLAlchemy 1.4's `select` and `scalar_one_or_none` methods. James learned the distinction between direct SQL execution and ORM querying through the `Connection` and `Session` objects in SQLAlchemy.
