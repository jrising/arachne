James sought a more scientifically accessible description of "limited substitutability" between economic and natural goods, particularly in relation to natural capital and strong sustainability. Initially, I suggested "low elasticity of substitution," which he noted was too economics-centric for non-economics audiences. In response, I provided an alternative phrasing: "restricted interchangeability." I explained that this emphasizes the irreplaceability of natural goods like clean air and biodiversity by human-made resources. I recommended a concise statement highlighting the critical role of natural capital in ecological balance to ensure clarity and accessibility for a broader audience.
