James inquired about creating a vertical line at x = 0.3 in a Plots plot using Julia. I provided a detailed code snippet using the Plots package, defining the plot range, creating the vertical line data, and plotting the vertical line with specific attributes. The code ensured the plot ranged from x = 0 to 1 and y = 0 to 1, presenting a vertical line at x = 0.3 with a red color and line width of 2.
