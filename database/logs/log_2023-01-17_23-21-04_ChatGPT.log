The discussion focused on rational expectations of prices and the use of a linear combination of recent prices to forecast future prices. The assistant explained that rational expectations theory suggests individuals' expectations of future prices are based on their best available information and are rational. It also mentioned the use of time series analysis to estimate future prices but noted that this approach has limitations. The assistant justified using a linear combination of recent prices by assuming stationarity of the underlying price process and the simplicity of linear models. It also highlighted that this approach may not always provide accurate forecasts. The assistant further explained that future prices being a linear combination of recent prices under rational expectations is based on market participants having access to the same information and using it to form expectations, as well as the assumption of market efficiency. However, it acknowledged that the linearity assumption may not hold in practice.
