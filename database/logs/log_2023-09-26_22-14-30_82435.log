The conversation involved James receiving an invitation to speak on a panel at the Virtual Ocean Pavilion at COP28. The email proposed a topic on social science challenges related to the United Nations Ocean Decade. One of the proposed speakers, James Rising, was identified as discussing the challenges of cost-benefit analyses and implicit goal-setting. James sought clarification on implicit goal-setting, and the AI explained it as the creation of objectives that are indirectly established and often emerge from actions or decisions. In the context of cost-benefit analyses, implicit goal-setting refers to how assumptions and methodologies can embed certain goals and values, potentially undermining broader societal goals. The AI emphasized the importance of identifying and addressing implicit goals to ensure a more holistic and inclusive approach to sustainability.
