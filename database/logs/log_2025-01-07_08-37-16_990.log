James requested a strategy for the fundraising team at the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) to enhance their online presence through LinkedIn. I proposed a comprehensive plan that included updating and optimizing profiles, regularly sharing insightful content, engaging with the audience, using LinkedIn's publishing platform, participating in relevant groups, and considering paid advertising. I also advised utilizing LinkedIn analytics to fine-tune strategies, conducting training sessions for best practices, integrating LinkedIn links in email signatures, and promoting the page on other platforms. The goal is to build visibility, credibility, and ultimately improve fundraising success through consistent and engaging LinkedIn presence.
