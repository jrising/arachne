In a previous conversation, James asked for the term that describes a minor adjustment on a vector of results that is not a reordering. The AI assistant responded that the term he might be looking for is "perturbation." A perturbation refers to a small adjustment applied to the values in a vector without changing their order. It is commonly used in numerical analysis, optimization algorithms, and sensitivity analysis to study the effects of small changes in input on the output.
