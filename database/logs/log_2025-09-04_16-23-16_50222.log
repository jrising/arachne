James sought a solution to ensure that the `listings` package in LaTeX treated single and double quotes in R code as straight quotes, allowing easy copy-pasting into R. Initially provided a method to adjust character settings, the output still showed curved quotes despite using `\lstinline`. Subsequently, I recommended disabling smart quotes globally using the `fontenc` package and redefining quote characters in the `lstset` settings. The proposed code snippet illustrated these changes, ensuring that the quotes would be represented correctly when the document was compiled. James was encouraged to compile the document with an appropriate tool to verify the solution.
