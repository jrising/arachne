The story of the cat and the rat involves a clever cat who wants to catch a tiny rat that keeps stealing his food. The cat sets up a trap with a net, but the rat notices it and seeks the help of a quick weasel. The weasel manages to grab the cheese from the trap before the cat can catch them. The wise owl advises them to think before they act, and the rat and weasel follow his advice from then on.
