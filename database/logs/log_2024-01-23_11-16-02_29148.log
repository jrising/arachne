James provided two syllabi for the courses MAST 488 and MAST 688 Climate Change Economics. Arachne combined the syllabi into a single Markdown format and created a course calendar with topics, practicums, readings, and assignments. James then requested additional details from the syllabi to be incorporated into the course calendar, and Arachne updated it accordingly. The resulting course calendar includes a breakdown of topics, practicums, readings, and assignments for both courses.
