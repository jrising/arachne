The income elasticity of the effect of a policy measures how the policy's impact changes across income levels. It is calculated using regression analysis, where the coefficient of income represents the elasticity. The formula for income elasticity \( \eta \) is expressed as a ratio involving the partial derivative of the policy effect with respect to income. Understanding this concept is crucial for designing equitable and effective interventions, especially in policy analysis aimed at addressing different income groups' needs.
