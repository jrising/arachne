In a previous conversation, James sought advice on selecting a lightly informative prior for the standard deviation parameter (sigma) in his Bayesian model. Arachne recommended two options: a half-normal distribution, which is positive-only and light-tailed, and a Gamma distribution, commonly used as a conjugate prior for the variance of a normal distribution. Arachne emphasized that the choice of prior should reflect James' prior beliefs about the parameter being estimated. If James believes his guess could be off by a greater amount, a more heavy-tailed distribution should be used.
