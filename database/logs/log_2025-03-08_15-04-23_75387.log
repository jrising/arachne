James inquired about health care coverage in the US when someone loses their job and later rejoins a plan. I explained that there can be a gap in coverage during this period, and outlined several options to address medical expenses that arise during this interval. Key options include COBRA for continued employer insurance, a Special Enrollment Period for the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid based on income and family size, and short-term health insurance for temporary coverage. I emphasized that any medical expenses incurred during the gap are the individual's responsibility unless covered by one of these provisions. It's crucial to review each option carefully.
