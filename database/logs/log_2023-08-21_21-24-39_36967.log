This conversation discusses the activities of beach nourishment and artificial reef emplacement in Delaware's marine waters. The beach nourishment projects, funded by private, state, and federal entities, involve transporting sediment from various sources to eroded coastlines, with data dating back to 1923. The Western Carolina University Beach Nourishment Viewer and the National Beach Nourishment Database provide information on the location, funding, sediment volume, and cost of over 2,000 nourishment episodes. Artificial reefs, primarily located in the bay and some in deeper waters, serve as enhanced habitats that support marine life through colonization by sessile organisms, protection for juveniles, and potential aggregation sites for spawning adults. The data collection on artificial reefs resulted from various research methods, including state and NOAA data, as well as internet-based investigations.
