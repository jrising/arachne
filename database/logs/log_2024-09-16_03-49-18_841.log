In this discussion, James requested help to engage banks as funders for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) to establish hubs educating about Building Performance Standards (BPS). I provided a draft proposal in Fraga text format, emphasizing the significance of BPS for energy savings and environmental impact. The proposal detailed the project's goals of creating city-wide hubs that offer educational resources, training, and stakeholder dialogue, while inviting banks to partner by offering financing and expertise. I underscored the benefits for both IMT and the banks in promoting sustainable lending practices and invited follow-up for further discussions on partnership opportunities.
