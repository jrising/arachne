The discussion revolved around DSGE models, specifically E3ME and the G-Cubed model. The AI explained that E3ME is a macroeconomic model used to study the impacts of energy and environmental policies on the European economy. It is a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The AI also clarified that DSGE models are typically estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and not vector autoregression (VAR) techniques. The AI provided a brief overview of the fundamental equations of a DSGE model and described the G-Cubed model as a large-scale, multi-country DSGE model used by the IMF to analyze the global economy. The AI also provided resources for finding more information about the E3ME model.
