James asked if it was possible to break up legends into multiple rows in `ggplot2`, as a single row was too wide. The assistant responded with an example using the `guides()` function in `ggplot2`, suggesting to set the number of rows using the `nrow` argument. The assistant provided code demonstrating how to break the legend up into multiple rows and suggested using `ncol` for a large number of legend items.
