In a discussion about existentialism and universal moral values, it was determined that while existentialism as a whole does not endorse universal moral values, individual existentialist philosophers have held diverse views on the subject. For those existentialists who rejected moral values, the justification for values, such as authenticity, often comes from the individual's own experience, freedom, and responsibility. Jean-Paul Sartre emphasized the importance of embracing freedom and taking responsibility for one's actions. Friedrich Nietzsche believed in creating one's own values and living passionately. Albert Camus focused on confronting the absurdity of existence and embracing life with authenticity. Authenticity is justified as a way to embrace one's own existence, overcome limitations, and create meaning in a world without inherent purpose or meaning.
