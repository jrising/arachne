Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility. While many existentialists reject universal moral values, they justify the importance of values such as authenticity through individual experience and the recognition of freedom and responsibility. Jean-Paul Sartre sees authenticity as embracing freedom and taking responsibility for one's choices; Friedrich Nietzsche sees it as creating one's own values and living passionately; Albert Camus sees it as confronting the absurd and living with passion. Authenticity is valued as a way to embrace existence, overcome limitations, and create meaning in a purposeless world.
