The conversation began with James asking if there was a way to include a geom in the legend of a ggplot without actually plotting it on the plot. Arachne provided a solution using a dummy data frame and explained the steps involved. A code example was given to demonstrate how to achieve this using `geom_tile`. The conversation ended with Arachne suggesting that the same approach can be adapted for other geoms by creating a dummy data frame with the desired aesthetics, adding the geom to the plot, and setting `show.legend = TRUE`.
