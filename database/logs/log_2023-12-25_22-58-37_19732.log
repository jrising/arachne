James inquired about using the `party` package in R to fit a random forest model, treating each observation as a distribution and applying a Two-Sample Anderson-Darling Test for splitting. The assistant clarified that traditional machine learning models, like Random Forest, are not designed to handle each observation as a distribution. Modifying the `party` package to accommodate this approach would require advanced and non-trivial modifications to the underlying code. The assistant suggested an alternative approach of representing each observation as a set of samples drawn from its distribution and using pairwise comparisons of empirical cumulative distribution functions as input features. Additionally, the assistant advised caution when modifying complex software and recommended thoroughly testing any modifications. The option to hire a developer experienced with R was also suggested if the alternative approach was not satisfactory.
