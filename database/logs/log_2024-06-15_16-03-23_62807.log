James' Ruby on Rails project comprises standard components like database migrations, controllers, models, views, and public assets. Key elements include `companies`, `namings`, and `offerings` migrations, controllers for companies and splash page, and models for companies and offerings. Tasks include adding company scaffolding and implementing user accounts for expenditure tracking. Suggestions entail generating scaffold for companies and setting up user authentication with Devise. James can proceed with these steps to enhance his project's functionality and user experience.
