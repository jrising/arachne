James inquired about the working directory setup in a project with a `data` directory for files and a `src` directory for code, specifically whether the code should assume its working directory to be `src` or the base directory. I explained that it's common to set the working directory to the base directory to ensure consistent path specification. I provided strategies to maintain this convention, including using relative paths from the base directory, explicitly setting the working directory in the script, and running scripts from the base directory. I emphasized that these methods keep the project structure clean and file access intuitive, and noted that IDEs can be configured to use the base directory as the working directory when running scripts.
