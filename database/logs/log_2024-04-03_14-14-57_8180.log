Ozone formation on hot days involves a complex process influenced by pollutants (NOx, VOCs), sunlight, and temperature. Factors like pollutant levels, solar radiation, wind patterns, and chemical interactions affect the speed of ozone formation. Ozone levels are lowest in the morning, peak in the afternoon under strong sunlight, and depend on the NOx/VOC ratio. High temperatures alone do not guarantee high ozone levels. Precise calculations require sophisticated atmospheric chemistry models.
