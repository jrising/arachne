James inquired about reading and writing JSONL files in Python. I provided him with code snippets for both reading from and writing to JSONL files, explaining that each line in a JSONL file is a valid JSON object. He later asked how to handle a JSONL file represented as a string. I responded by showing how to split the string by newline characters, parse each line as JSON, and create a list of JSON objects using Python's `json` module. This allowed him to effectively manage JSONL data when it comes in string format.
