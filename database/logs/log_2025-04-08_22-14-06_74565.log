James inquired about the conditions under which a "bang-bang" harvest solution represents the "most rapid approach path" for optimal fisheries management. I explained that this strategy involves toggling between full and no exploitation and is optimal under several conditions. Key factors include linear state dynamics of fish populations, consistent cost structures, high discount rates that favor immediate returns, critical population thresholds, rapid regeneration rates of fish stocks, and regulatory constraints. I emphasized the importance of analyzing the specific dynamics, economic conditions, and legal frameworks of the fishery in question to determine the appropriateness of a "bang-bang" approach.
