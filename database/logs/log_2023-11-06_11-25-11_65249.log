In a previous conversation, James asked how to make the amount of energy of 1 TWh intuitive. Arachne provided several ways to interpret one TWh of energy in a more relatable manner. These included comparisons to power generation, fossil fuels, renewable energy, transportation, human power, and national energy usage. Arachne explained that one TWh of electricity is enough to power about 100,000 homes for a year or drive a Tesla Model S P100D over 1.2 billion miles. Additionally, Arachne compared one TWh to the energy generated by a solar farm the size of Manhattan operating at peak efficiency for 11 months or a wind farm the size of Chicago generating energy for a year. Arachne noted that these were rough estimates and actual numbers might vary based on technology efficiency and consumption changes.
