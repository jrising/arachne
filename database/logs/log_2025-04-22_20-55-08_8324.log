In a dialogue about adaptation investment plans, James Rising sought to propose a new consensus list based on insights from Paul and Daniela. He emphasized the importance of government support, the varying returns on investment, context-specific benefits, unlocking international funding, mitigating systemic risks, and the complexities of integrating adaptation and decarbonization efforts. A draft email was suggested, outlining these points along with relevant case studies from the UK and Rwanda to support the consensus. James requested these points to be numbered and aligned with case study insights, which were provided to enhance the discussion on investment planning for adaptation.
