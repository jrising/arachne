In a previous conversation, James asked about using the `span` parameter in the `loess` smoothing function in R to limit the data used for smoothing. Arachne explained that the `span` parameter controls the degree of smoothing, with smaller values corresponding to less data being used. Using the example of 81 years of data from 1940 to 2020, James wanted to limit the smoothing to 20 years of data. Arachne calculated that a `span` value of 0.2469 (approximately) would achieve this. Arachne provided an example code snippet using the `loess()` function to perform the smoothing with the desired span value. The suggested approach provided an approximation of a moving window of 20 years for smoothing the data.
