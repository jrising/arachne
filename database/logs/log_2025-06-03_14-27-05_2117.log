In the conversation, James faced a `ConnectionError` while using Pyppeteer in a loop that opened and closed browser pages, without closing the browser until the end. It was advised to ensure proper resource management by closing each page after use and handling exceptions with try-except blocks. James then inquired about blocking calls in asynchronous functions and learned that synchronous functions could stall the event loop. To manage long-running functions, he was introduced to using `asyncio.run_in_executor`. Later, James encountered a `RuntimeError` related to closing the browser after an error, prompting a discussion on safely handling errors during browser closure. The provided solution involved wrapping `await browser.close()` in a try-except block to suppress exceptions and ensure graceful termination of the browser.
