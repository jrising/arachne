James inquired about the infinite sum \( \sum_t \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^t} \), which led to a discussion about its nature as a geometric series. I explained that using the formula for the infinite sum of a geometric series, the result for this specific sum is \( \frac{1 + \beta}{\beta} \), assuming \( \beta > -1 \) for convergence. This synthesis highlighted the mathematical approach to solving the problem posed by James.
