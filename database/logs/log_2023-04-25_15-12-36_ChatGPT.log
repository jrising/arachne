In the article "The Inhumanity of academic freedom," the author criticizes the limitations of academic freedom in addressing broader social and political struggles. They argue that academic freedom fails to prioritize the human experience and does not offer guidance or protection for those seeking revolutionary change against inequality. The author highlights the suppression of pro-Palestine advocacy in academic spaces and the complicity of tenured professors in the current state of academia. They call for the pursuit of true freedom and the creation of unsanctioned solidarities as a means to realize a world without stagnant doctrines of pragmatism. The author's critique of academic freedom as "inhuman" implies that it does not sufficiently address the human needs and rights of marginalized individuals and communities.
