In the previous conversation, James sought ideas for an anagram pun to close his Christmas letter addendum for someone who loves puzzles and puns. Arachne suggested using a well-known phrase and anagramming it. Arachne provided an example: "A dimly sung star: try grand mussels!" anagrammed from "May your struggles turn into grand successes." James can guide his friend to solve the puzzle and discover the original phrase, making it an enjoyable activity for them.
