In a previous conversation, James asked how to share an external hard drive with all users on his server. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions for adjusting the permissions settings. However, when others attempted to list the contents of the directory, they encountered a "permission denied" error. In response, Arachne suggested that the issue may be related to the permissions of the parent directory. She provided additional steps for changing the ownership and permissions of the parent directory and its subdirectories. The changes should allow other users to navigate through the directory structure and access the contents of the external hard drive.
