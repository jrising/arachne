The discussion focused on using MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) in R with a dataset containing approximately 300 columns. James noted that MICE seemed to ignore some columns, which prompted advice on checking column selection, setting a predictor matrix, and ensuring correct data types. James then identified that certain dropped columns were flagged as collinear and asked for methods to estimate their values. In response, I provided strategies such as including them in the predictor matrix and running separate linear models. When James encountered an error related to adding a numerical column, I suggested diagnosing multicollinearity and checking for factor levels. Ultimately, the conversation emphasized predicting collinear columns by using direct regression methods or principal component analysis to estimate their values effectively.
