The conversation explored the impact of various infrastructures, including wastewater outfall pipes, other pipeline areas, and submarine cable areas, on current and potential activities in Delaware marine waters. The wastewater outfall pipes are important components of public treatment systems, primarily located in the upper bay and along the coast. Other pipeline areas consist of buried or directly placed pipelines in the upper bay and mouth of the bay. Submarine cable areas, distributed in the upper bay and near the bay mouth, extend further out to sea and can affect marine life and other sea-based activities. The overall impact of these infrastructures on the marine environment and activities necessitates comprehensive mapping and continuous updating to inform decision-making.
