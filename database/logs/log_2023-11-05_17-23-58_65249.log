During a previous conversation, James sought assistance on generating speech with the Coqui TTS system and playing it through audio speakers with minimal latency. The assistant provided a solution using Python and the `pydub` package. However, James encountered an error indicating that a bytes-like object was required, not a list. The assistant promptly responded by suggesting an updated code snippet that converts the list of bytes into a single byte object using the `bytes().join()` method. The byte object is then used to create an `AudioSegment` and played through the speakers. James was advised to try the updated code and provide feedback if further issues arise.
