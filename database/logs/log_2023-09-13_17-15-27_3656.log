In a previous conversation, James asked for a way to concisely convey the breakdown of a total risk estimate in an academic paper. Arachne suggested using the terms "comprising" or "composed of" to indicate the different components of the estimate. Arachne provided example sentences, such as "The total risk estimate is 10%, comprising 5% estimated using bottom-up calculations, 4% from catastrophic risks, and 1% from missing risks." or "The total risk estimate of 10% is broken down into 5% estimated using bottom-up calculations, 4% from catastrophic risks, and 1% from missing risks." These phrases effectively communicate the breakdown of the estimate in a clear and succinct manner.
