The cost of globally reducing methane emissions by 30% in 2030 is difficult to determine precisely due to various factors such as technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and political and economic conditions. While estimates suggest that a significant reduction in global methane emissions is possible with existing technology, the actual costs can vary greatly. Additionally, the cost of not taking action to reduce methane emissions can be significant in terms of climate change and its impacts.
