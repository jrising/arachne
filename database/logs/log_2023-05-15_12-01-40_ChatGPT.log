In a previous conversation, James asked about the global cost of reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The AI explained that providing a precise figure is difficult due to various factors such as technological feasibility, cost-effectiveness of strategies, and political and economic conditions in different countries. However, the AI mentioned that the International Energy Agency estimated that three-quarters of global methane emissions could be reduced with existing technology, and half of these reductions could be achieved at no net cost. The actual costs can vary significantly based on these factors and would require updated, detailed, and region-specific data. Additionally, the AI highlighted the importance of reducing methane emissions to mitigate climate change and its potential impacts.
