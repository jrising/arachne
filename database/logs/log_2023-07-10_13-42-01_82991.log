The discussion focused on the requirements for tenure in economics departments, specifically the need to publish in "top-five" journals. The assistant provided a list of commonly regarded top journals in economics, mentioned that the ranking can vary and institutions may have their own interpretation of the top-five list. The assistant also explained that while publishing in these journals can boost an individual's application, it is not a universal requirement and each institution has its own policies and standards. It was suggested to check with the specific department or institution to find out their tenure requirements.
