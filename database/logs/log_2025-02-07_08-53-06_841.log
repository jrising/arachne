James requested a revision of the Community ClimateShift initiative description for a more corporate funder focus. The response restructured the text to emphasize collaboration between local governments and communities while underscoring achievements such as establishing a national movement infrastructure, developing a governance plan centered on community leadership, and securing a $5M U.S. Department of Energy grant. Key elements included the commitment to inclusivity through the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing, and the aim to foster relationships that produce equitable building performance policies. The response concluded with an invitation for corporate entities to support the initiative, reinforcing the harmony between sustainability and community priorities.
