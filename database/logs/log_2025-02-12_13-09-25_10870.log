James requested assistance in drafting a professional email response regarding a candidate interested in Environmental Economics. The candidate has a strong quantitative background and aims to conduct research, specifically on climate change risks and policies. Despite the candidate being an excellent fit, James needed to convey the unfortunate lack of funding. The final email highlighted the candidateâ€™s commendable qualifications, communicated the absence of funding, and invited further discussion through a Zoom meeting link for possible alignment of research interests with future opportunities.
