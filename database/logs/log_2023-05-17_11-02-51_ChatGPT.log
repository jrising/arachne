In this conversation, James asked how to force an HTML element to have a specific width and wrap its content within that width. Arachne provided a CSS solution and explained how to debug if the width was not being respected. James mentioned that the elements were in the SVG namespace and asked if overflow wrapping was possible in SVG. Arachne explained that SVG does not support text wrapping natively but suggested a workaround using JavaScript and the D3.js library to split the text into multiple `tspan` elements.
