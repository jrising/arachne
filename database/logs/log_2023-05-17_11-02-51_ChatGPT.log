In a previous conversation, James asked how to force an HTML element to have a specific width and wrap its content text within that width. The assistant provided CSS code to achieve this and explained that the `word-wrap` and `overflow-wrap` properties can be used for wrapping text within a specified width. James then reported an issue where the width setting was not being respected and asked for a solution. The assistant mentioned potential reasons for this issue, such as conflicting CSS rules with higher specificity or Flexbox/Grid layouts overriding the width property. The assistant also provided guidance on debugging using the browser's Developer Tools. James then inquired about doing overflow wrapping in the SVG namespace. The assistant informed James that SVG elements do not support text wrapping natively but suggested a workaround using the D3.js library to split the text into `tspan` elements. The assistant provided a code snippet demonstrating how to use the `wrapText` JavaScript function.
