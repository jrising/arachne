In a previous conversation, James asked how to represent a value of 1.3e-3 km^2 using the `siunitx` package in LaTeX. I provided a solution by using the `\SI` command from the `siunitx` package, where the number and unit are formatted together. I demonstrated the code to represent the value as `\SI{1.3e-3}{\kilo\meter\squared}` and advised James to include the `siunitx` package in the preamble of the document. Additionally, I reminded James to compile the document with LaTeX to see the changes after modifying the code.
