In a discussion with James, we explored the funding priorities for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) and determined the financial needs to support projects and sustain a staff of 35 over the next four years. Key areas of focus included Policy, Business Engagement, Community Engagement, and Operations, with estimates indicating a total funding requirement likely in the multimillion-dollar range based on staffing, program, and operational costs. We also assessed the costs associated with expanding existing Department of Energy-funded projects and other initiatives, such as the National Building Performance Standards Coalition and partnerships with the Public Health Law Center. Recommendations included developing detailed budgets for scaling initiatives, identifying additional resources, and engaging funding sources like the Energy Foundation to support IMTâ€™s mission.
