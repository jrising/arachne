James Rising, a researcher from the University of Delaware, proposed estimating current climate losses in different countries to support their demand for support from developed nations. The methodology includes using a machine learning approach to integrate insights from various research papers. Quality values are assigned to different attributes of the models, and a random forest machine learning model is fitted for each country-year-Monte Carlo draw. The quality values are obtained based on specific criteria for each attribute. The resulting estimates will provide percent reductions in GDP per capita and capital wealth for each country, reflecting the impact of climate change since 1950. The estimates will be reported at the global level and for different country and regional groups. The findings will be presented in a short report released during COP28.
