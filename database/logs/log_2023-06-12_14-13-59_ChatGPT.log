During the discussion, James asked about a term for the component of variance in a decomposition that cannot be attributed to known sources. The AI assistant provided the term "residual variance" and suggested "interaction variance" as a possible term when the unexplained variance is due to interaction between sources. James then asked about situations where the total variance is greater or less than the sum of the variances from individual sources. The assistant explained that when the total variance is greater, it's called shared or overlapping variance, and proposed adding a "shared variance" term to the decomposition. When the total variance is less, the assistant suggested adding an "excess variance" term. James also inquired about negative revised variances, and the assistant advised modeling complex interactions or clamping the variances at zero. Finally, James asked if the term "shared variance" should be used when the total variance is less than the sum of the variances, and the assistant explained that it would be referred to as residual or unexplained variance.
