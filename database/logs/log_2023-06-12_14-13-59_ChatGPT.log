In this discussion, James asked about terminology and methods related to variance decomposition. The assistant explained that the component of variance that cannot be specifically attributed to any known sources is often called "residual variance" or "unexplained variance". James then inquired about situations where the total variance is greater or less than the sum of the individual variances. The assistant suggested introducing a term called "shared variance" or "overlapping variance" to account for the excess variance in these cases and provided formulas to calculate revised variances. However, if the revised variances become negative, it indicates more complex interactions or a need for more sophisticated modeling. James also asked about adding the excess variance as an additional term if the total variance is smaller than the sum of the individual variances. The assistant confirmed that this can be done, but cautioned that it may oversimplify the interactions between sources of variance. More intricate modeling techniques would be required for a comprehensive understanding of these interactions.
