In this conversation, James consults with me regarding his design of a new language using the letters N, I, and O. He requests English translations for all two-letter roots, based on fundamental concepts and dimensions that the language should capture. I provide translations for each root, along with directions for further roots that build off of each concept. The translations cover a wide range of concepts, such as action, transformation, intuition, passivity, stability, reaction, potentiality, expression, constraint, exploration, organization, selection, limitation, efficiency, differentiation, collaboration, transformation, reflection, empathy, reciprocity, synthesis, trust, intuition, gratitude, patience, resilience, and curiosity. The result is a comprehensive set of translations that can greatly expand the capabilities of James' new language.
