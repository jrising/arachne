In a previous conversation, James sought assistance for modifying his PHP application to include an additional `parent_id` column in an online system. After sharing his existing code, I provided an updated script enabling conditional handling for the `parent_id` value, allowing it to be inserted as `NULL` when not set. Following this, James encountered a 500 error while executing `post_statement.php`. To diagnose the issue, I suggested enabling error reporting in PHP, checking various server logs (Apache, Nginx, or PHP-FPM), assessing `.htaccess` files, testing SQL queries separately, verifying file permissions, and looking for syntax errors or infinite loops. These strategies aimed to help James identify the root of the error to ensure smooth functionality of his application.
