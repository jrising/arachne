James asked for alternative words for "scope of responsibility," and I provided a list of terms including "purview," "jurisdiction," "duties," "obligations," "charge," "domain," "ambit," "sphere of influence," "area of responsibility," "remit," "bailiwick," and "portfolio" with the reminder that the choice of term might depend on the context.
