James Rising discussed a response to an inquiry from Junjie Zhu, expressing interest in a Ph.D. position at the University of Delaware's School of Marine Science & Policy. Key points included advising Junjie about the transition of the Master's in Marine Policy to the new Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track, and emphasizing the Ph.D. in Environmental Economics as the preferred program. James noted limited funding for Ph.D. programs and the self-funded status of Master's programs. He instructed to direct the applicant to a new form for program selection and encouraged mentioning relevant research interests in the statement of purpose for potential alignment with his work. A draft email response was provided for clarity and efficiency in communication.
