In this conversation, James sought help drafting a professional email response to Sarah Stafford, a prospective student for the Master of Marine Policy program. Sarah expressed interest in James's research on climate change and noise pollution from shipping vessels, inquiring about her application status and potential collaboration. James's email response thanked Sarah for her interest, informed her that there were no funded positions available this year, and mentioned that they were considering admitting students without funding. He offered Sarah a chance to schedule a Zoom call to discuss her research interests further.
