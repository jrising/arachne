This conversation revolved around James's grant proposal on climate change's impact on food production and human health. The project aims to investigate the consequences of climate change on agriculture and fisheries in West Africa, specifically in Senegal and Nigeria. Arachne provided an outline for the "Research Plan" and "Impact, Engagement, and Dissemination Plan," suggesting different work packages and identifying the leading institutions and contributors for each package. The suggested work packages include assessing climate change impacts on agriculture and fisheries, studying the health and nutrition outcomes, co-creating tools and datasets for stakeholders, conducting bioeconomic modeling, assessing ecosystem services and sustainability management, engaging with stakeholders for co-development, and disseminating findings through the Food Security Futures Explorer. The breakdown of work packages is intended to provide actionable understanding and develop adaptation practices for sustainable agriculture and fisheries in the face of climate change.
