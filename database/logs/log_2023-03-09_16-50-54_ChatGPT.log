The difference between a geodatabase and a shapefile lies in their capabilities and complexity. Shapefiles are simple, non-topological formats used for basic GIS tasks, while geodatabases are more advanced, allowing for the storage of complex data, topology, and relationships between features. Geodatabases are suitable for large, enterprise-level GIS projects and offer greater functionality and scalability.
