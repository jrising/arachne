The discussion focused on the military use of the Delaware planning area for a report. It provided a comprehensive description of the two military operating areas (OPAREA) in the region: the VACAPES OPAREA near shore and the Atlantic City OPAREA further offshore. These OPAREAs serve as designated zones for national defense training exercises and system qualification tests, fostering coordination with federal, state, local agencies, and the general public. The report also mentioned the Ship Shock Trial Area for testing ship resilience against undersea explosions. Notably, the Navy adjusted the Ship Shock Trial Area location and introduced a buffer zone to mitigate potential impacts on marine life. The overall focus was on harmonizing military readiness, ocean use, and environmental stewardship in the Delaware planning area.
