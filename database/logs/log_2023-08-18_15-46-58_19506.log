The Delaware planning area houses two main military operating areas (OPAREAs): the Virginia Capes (VACAPES) OPAREA near shore and the Atlantic City OPAREA further offshore. These OPAREAs are designated zones for national defense training exercises and system qualification tests, with the intention of coordinating activities with other agencies and the general public. The VACAPES OPAREA is closer to the coast and serves as an active military operational zone, while the Atlantic City OPAREA is used for larger scale or more intensive training operations. Additionally, there is a Ship Shock Trial Area south of the Delaware planning zone where the Navy tests ship resilience against undersea explosions. The Navy made adjustments to the Ship Shock Trial Area based on public comments, moving operations further out to sea and incorporating a 5 Nautical Mile buffer zone to protect marine life. The Delaware planning area aims to balance military readiness, ocean use, and environmental stewardship.
