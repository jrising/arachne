James asked how to convert a degree-minute coordinate representation in Excel to a decimal coordinate. Arachne provided step-by-step instructions using the `Text to Columns` feature and a formula to convert the degrees and minutes to decimal degrees. The formula accounts for negative degrees in the southern and western hemispheres. Arachne also cautioned that this method assumes the starting data is in degrees and decimal minutes, and that different conversions would be needed for coordinates with seconds. James was advised to always back up his data before making any manipulations to avoid accidental loss.
