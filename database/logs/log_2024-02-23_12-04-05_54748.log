James sought guidance on modifying ggplot legends. Arachne advised hiding the default "a" label in ggplot legends when using `geom_label` by incorporating `show.legend = FALSE` in the function. Arachne also shared steps on relocating the legend to the bottom of a ggplot and displaying it as a horizontal row by utilizing the `theme` function with `legend.position = "bottom"` and `legend.direction = "horizontal"`.
