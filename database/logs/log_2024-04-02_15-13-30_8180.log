James is teaching a class on Climate Change Economics, focusing on Tol's chapter 4 reading. The chapter discusses policy instruments like direct regulation, taxes, subsidies, and tradable permits for emission reduction. Key points include the effectiveness of taxes for cost certainty, the independence of market allocation from initial permit allocation, the impact of technological progress on policy costs, and the importance of letting the market, not governments, pick winners in innovation. Multiple-choice questions provided by Arachne test student comprehension of these concepts.
