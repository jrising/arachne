In a conversation about creating a world map in R using `ggplot2`, James asked for guidance on coloring countries based on a value and adding speckling or diagonal lines for statistically significant areas. I provided a detailed solution involving data preparation, using `geom_polygon`, and adding patterns with `geom_sf_pattern` to represent significance. James inquired whether striping is typically applied to significant or non-significant areas, leading to a discussion on IPCC practices, where striping usually emphasizes significant regions. Lastly, he encountered a ggsave error regarding an unknown graphics device, which I resolved by advising him to specify a valid file extension (e.g., `.png` or `.pdf`) when saving plots in R.
