In a previous conversation, James asked about the `.each` command in jQuery applied to a list of DOM elements that would return a promise. Arachne explained that the `.each` method in jQuery is designed for synchronous execution and does not directly support Promises or asynchronous operations. However, Arachne provided an alternative approach using `Array.prototype.map` and `Promise.all` in JavaScript to apply a function involving Promises to each element in a list and retrieve an array of resolved promises. Arachne also mentioned that `Promise.all` fails fast, meaning if any promise is rejected, it immediately aborts with a rejection. Finally, Arachne shared example code to illustrate the implementation of this approach.
