James encountered an error during the CI Jekyll build step related to a missing directory, prompting him to seek assistance. I identified the issue as related to file paths, case-sensitivity, and configuration in the Jekyll setup. To troubleshoot, I suggested checking file existence, case sensitivity, reviewing `_config.yml`, and running the site locally. Following his follow-up request to disable the action, I provided detailed steps to disable or delete the GitHub Actions workflow by navigating through the repository settings and editing the workflow file, as well as how to cancel any currently running workflows.
