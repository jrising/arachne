James inquired about the term used when a government designs policy to realize fiscal benefits from its investments, which I identified as "economic development policy" or "ROI policy design." He then mentioned "monetary capture," prompting clarification regarding related terms. I provided "fiscal capture" and "value capture" as relevant concepts. "Value Capture" refers to recovering increased land values from public investments, while "Fiscal Capture" assesses a government's ability to obtain economic returns from its expenditures. Ultimately, I suggested "fiscal capture" as the term most relevant to discussions on the challenges of achieving expected fiscal outcomes.
