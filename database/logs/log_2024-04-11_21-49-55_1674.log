James asked for help with handling `inf` values in a xarray dataset when calculating the mean, suspecting that land `inf` values were causing issues. I explained that using the `nanmean()` function instead of `mean()` would ignore `inf` values. I provided the code snippet `ds.zos.where(xr.ufuncs.isfinite(ds.zos)).mean(dim=['lat', 'lon'])` to achieve this and reminded James to update libraries if needed for compatibility.
