When selling a house with a solar panel lease or loan, there are several options available. The first option is to transfer the lease or loan to the new homeowner, with the company's approval and the new buyer meeting certain qualifications. The second option is to prepay the remainder of the lease or loan, eliminating the responsibility for monthly payments for the new buyer. The third option is to physically move the solar panels to the new house, which can be complex and costly. Buyers may see a functioning solar system as a positive or a negative, depending on their preferences and the housing market dynamics. The chosen option depends on the agreement with the solar panel company, personal preference, and the potential buyer's preferences. Clear communication about the benefits and responsibilities of the solar system is important during the sale process.
