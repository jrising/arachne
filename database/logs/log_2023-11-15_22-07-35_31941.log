The previous conversations with James covered a range of topics, including the future of the nonprofit sector and philanthropy, understanding the limitations of the Deep Scattering Layer (DSL), terminology in econometrics, naming folded pieces of paper with students' names, clarifying a concept note on climate change's impact on food production and vulnerable populations, open-source alternatives to IMPLAN, summarizing a climate impact assessment, troubleshooting data mutation with `dplyr`, estimating the cost of reducing global methane emissions, and discussing potential environmental impacts and monitoring strategies for offshore wind projects. In response to James' question about climate data for oceanic features like SST, I explained that "oceanic climate data" or "marine climate data" are suitable terms for those types of data.
