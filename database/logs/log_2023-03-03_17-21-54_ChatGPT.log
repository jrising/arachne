The discussion revolved around calculating the value of information for a data product and specifically focused on two scenarios: the value of information for a general data product and the value of information of an increase in resolution of a gridded data product. The steps provided for both scenarios included defining the objective, identifying relevant information, assessing the quality or existing resolution, determining the potential impact, estimating the cost, and calculating the net value. Additionally, the possibility of using information entropy as a general approach for calculating the value of information was discussed, which involves calculating the entropy of the current data and the entropy with additional information, and then using the difference to determine the value.
