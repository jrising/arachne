The conversation discussed how to select the value from column B when the value in column A in a Google Sheets is X. The assistant provided two methods: using the VLOOKUP function or the INDEX and MATCH functions. Both methods involve selecting the cell where the result will be displayed, typing the appropriate formula, and pressing Enter. "X" should be replaced with the desired value.
