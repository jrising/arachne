In a previous conversation, James asked how to select the value from column B in Google Sheets when the value in column A in that row is X. The assistant provided two methods: using the `VLOOKUP` function and using the `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions. For both methods, James needed to select the cell where he wanted the result, type the appropriate formula, and replace "X" with the desired value. The `VLOOKUP` method used the formula `=VLOOKUP(X,A:B,2,FALSE)`, where "X" represented the search value and A:B indicated the range of data. The `INDEX` and `MATCH` method used the formula `=INDEX(B:B,MATCH(X,A:A,0))`, again with "X" representing the search value and A:A and B:B indicating the data ranges.
