In a prior conversation, James requested assistance in drafting a corporate giving policy for the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). I provided a framework, asking for clarification on company values, budget, and donation methods. James then supplied detailed information about IMT's mission, independence, funding sources, and conflict of interest protocols. Based on this, I crafted a comprehensive corporate giving policy that highlights IMT's purpose in promoting high-performing buildings, outlines its non-partisan stance, and establishes guidelines for funding sources and conflict management. The policy emphasizes transparency, integrity, and regular evaluation to ensure alignment with IMT's mission and ethical standards.
