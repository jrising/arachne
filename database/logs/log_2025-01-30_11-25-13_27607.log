In a series of emails, Bornali Mondal expressed her strong desire to pursue a Ph.D. in Environmental Economics under James Rising's supervision at the University of Delaware. Following her application submission for fall 2025, she sought feedback on her research and reiterated her enthusiasm to work together. James initially acknowledged her interest but informed her that he lacked funding for new students that year. Despite Bornali's persistence and requests for financial support, including a waiver of tuition fees, James encouraged her to seek external scholarships, providing examples like the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fulbright-Nehru Program. He also offered a Zoom meeting opportunity to discuss further.
