In a previous conversation, James asked about the timing of coffee harvest in Brazil, and I explained that it typically occurs from May to September, though it can vary. He then inquired about how different shipping months are handled in futures markets. I informed him that they are referred to as "contract months" and explained that futures contracts specify the commodity, amount, and delivery date. Prices for different contract months can vary based on supply and demand factors. Finally, James asked about the creation of the London Robusta Coffee Futures contract. I informed him that it was created by LIFFE, established in 1982, and has been a major exchange for agricultural and commodity futures.
