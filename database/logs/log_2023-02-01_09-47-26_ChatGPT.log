James asked about the timing of coffee harvest in Brazil and the handling of different shipping months in futures markets. Arachne provided information on the harvest time in Brazil and explained how different shipping months are handled in futures markets, including the concept of contract months and price differences based on supply and demand. James then asked about the creation of the London Robusta Coffee Futures contract, and Arachne explained that it was created by LIFFE, a leading exchange for trading agricultural and commodity futures and options contracts, established in 1982.
