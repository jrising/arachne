James requested a detailed plan for promoting an impact report leading up to the end of the year, specifying dates and responsible teams. I provided a structured promotion plan outlining tasks for various teams from mid-September to year-end. Key tasks included finalizing the report design, reaching out to stakeholders, launching a social media teaser campaign, hosting an online webinar, and monitoring engagement metrics. The plan emphasized personalized communication and follow-up for priority stakeholders, concluding with an assessment of promotional strategies' impact. I encouraged James to review and customize the plan based on specific team capabilities and organizational context.
