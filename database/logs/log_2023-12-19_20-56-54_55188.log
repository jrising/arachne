In this conversation, James seeks assistance in creating a pithy ending for his hand-written addendum to his Christmas letter. He specifically requests an anagram of a pun that would cater to someone who loves puzzles and puns. Arachne suggests the phrase "Never odd or even" as a palindrome and provides its anagram "Overdone end rev" as a playful option. Arachne explains that using "overdone end revs" as the ending can metaphorically convey the excitement and invigorations of the new year, which puzzle lovers would appreciate.
