In a previous conversation, James inquired about closed groundwater reservoirs and confined aquifers. Arachne explained that a closed groundwater reservoir lacking natural replenishment is referred to as an "artificially confined aquifer." Similarly, an impermeable layer overlays confined aquifers and restricts water from rising to the surface. The converse of a confined aquifer is an unconfined or "water table" aquifer, which lacks an impermeable layer and pressure, allowing water to rise to the surface. James then asked about the rate at which rainfall can reach an unconfined aquifer, to which Arachne replied that the rate varies based on soil permeability, land slope, vegetation cover, and other factors. Moreover, recharge rate is generally slower than discharge rate, depending on precipitation and water usage. In the Western US, water rights are primarily determined through prior appropriation, where the first person to beneficially use the water has exclusive rights. Surface water and groundwater rights are subject to the doctrine of beneficial use, which mandates water be used for societal benefits.
