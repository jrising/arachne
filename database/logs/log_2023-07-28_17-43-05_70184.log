The proposed perspective article aims to bridge the disconnect between economic and physical sciences in addressing climate change. It highlights the need for enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, the integration of local information, nature, and health into economic assessments, the focus on adaptation and development, as well as the incorporation of ethics, inequality, and justice. The proposal also suggests communicating uncertainty through storylines, assessing future impacts, and prioritizing research on extreme events, tipping points, adaptation, migration, and more.
