James Rising proposes a joint perspective article for Nature and the Journal of Economic Perspectives that aims to bridge the disconnect between economic and physical sciences in addressing climate change. The proposed article will discuss key findings and research priorities from a recent workshop at the Royal Society. It emphasizes the need for enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, disaggregating data and integrating local information, integrating nature and health into economic assessments, increasing focus on adaptation and development, incorporating ethics, inequality, and justice, communicating uncertainty through storylines, assessing future impacts, and highlighting research priorities. The article aims to address the inadequate representation of scientific evidence in economic models, which leads to the underestimation of climate change repercussions and hinders effective policymaking. The proposed perspective article seeks to provide actionable insights for researchers, policymakers, and readers across sectors.
