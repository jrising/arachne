James sought suggestions for a font to use for the title of a binder about his child, featuring the song "Forever Young". Arachne provided several font options that convey a sense of youth, timelessness, or liveliness, including Comic Sans MS, Chalkduster, Jokerman, Brush Script MT, and Papyrus. James then requested more suggestions similar to Jokerman, and Arachne recommended Harrington, Porky's, Juice ITC, Jester, and Showcard Gothic. Arachne emphasized the importance of readability and coherence with other design elements in the binder.
