In a previous conversation, James asked how to add a certain number of meters in the northward and eastward directions to a given latitude and longitude in Python. Arachne originally recommended using the 'geopy' library's 'geodesic' function, but it seems that function is no longer available. Arachne then suggested using the 'pyproj' library as an alternative. The revised code provided converts the meters to approximated degrees of latitude and longitude using the 'pyproj' library's coordinate transformer. The deltas are then added to the starting latitude and longitude to obtain the final coordinates. Arachne encouraged James to try the revised code and provide feedback.
