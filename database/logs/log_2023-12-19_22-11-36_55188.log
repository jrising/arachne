In a previous conversation, James asked if the EU ETS covers emissions from cement and flaring. Arachne confirmed that the EU ETS does cover emissions from the cement industry, as it is considered an energy-intensive industrial sector. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether it adequately covers the indirect emissions of cement. Regarding flaring, Arachne explained that while most off-gas flaring is covered by the EU ETS, there are exceptions. Flaring that occurs as part of a process within a sector covered by the EU ETS is included, but emergency flaring and flaring in exploration/extraction may be overlooked. Arachne emphasized the importance of checking the details in databases or legislative documents for accurate information.
