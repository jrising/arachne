James asked for guidance on how to copy a bunch of files and overwrite files in an existing directory tree on Linux. Arachne explained that the `cp` command can be used for this purpose, along with the `-f` (force) option to overwrite files without asking for confirmation. She provided a sample command using the `cp` command, `-Rf` option for recursive copying, and explained each part of the command. Arachne also reminded James to be cautious when using the `-f` option to prevent unintended overwriting of files.
