James asked how to use `os.listdir` in Python to list only files in a specific directory, not subdirectories. Arachne provided a code snippet utilizing the `os` and `os.path` modules to filter out only files directly in the given directory. This approach ensured that subdirectories were not included in the output, addressing James's specific requirement for listing files in a directory.
