In a previous conversation, James requested a partnership agreement draft for "Green Lease Leaders," structured around three tiers of engagement: Sustainability Advocates, Green Lease Implementers, and Sustainability Leaders. I provided a detailed outline covering the purpose, definitions, partners' obligations, terms of partnership, confidentiality, termination, and dispute resolution. I emphasized that this draft serves merely as a framework and advised consulting a lawyer for a comprehensive legal agreement tailored to specific needs. I also offered to help elaborate on the roles and responsibilities associated with each tier.
