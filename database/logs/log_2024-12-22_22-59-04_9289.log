James Rising provided a brief email response to Md. Jamil Uddin, who expressed interest in pursuing a Master of Science in Environmental Science. The conversation clarified several academic programs, informing Uddin about the transition of the Masters in Marine Policy to the new Environmental Science & Management program with a Marine track, and highlighted the Ph.D. options suitable for non-traditional students. James guided Uddin to a new form for prospective students, encouraging him to apply by the December 1 deadline for Ph.D. funding consideration. The email maintained brevity and professionalism, as requested.
