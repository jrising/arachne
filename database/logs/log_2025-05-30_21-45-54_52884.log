James sought help to debug a webpage issue related to selecting an alternative speech synthesizer voice on his phone, suspecting a JavaScript error. I provided several methods for checking errors, including enabling remote debugging via Chrome DevTools for Android or Safari’s Web Inspector for iOS. I mentioned useful mobile browser console apps like Metarhia — DevTools and Inspect. I also suggested adding `console.log()` statements in his code for tracing issues and highlighted the importance of ensuring browser support for the Web Speech API and permissions. These steps aimed to help James identify the source of the problem effectively.
