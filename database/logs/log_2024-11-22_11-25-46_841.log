James inquired about foundations in the Los Angeles area that support work related to the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT). I provided a list of five relevant foundations: The California Endowment, which focuses on health and environmental factors; The Annenberg Foundation, supporting diverse causes including sustainability; The California Community Foundation (CCF), which leads systemic change and funds environmental projects; The Weingart Foundation, promoting social equity and sustainability as a social justice issue; and The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, dedicated to climate change and conservation. I emphasized the importance of framing funding requests to align with each foundation's mission.
