In the conversation, James sought to understand the differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims, which I explained through their historical origins, beliefs, demographics, and contemporary political contexts. Sunnis form the majority (85-90%) and believe in consensus leadership, while Shia Muslims (10-15%) emphasize authority through the Prophet Muhammad's family. We discussed stereotypes each group holds about the other, with Sunnis sometimes viewing Shias as idolatrous or politically disloyal, and Shias perceiving Sunnis as intolerant or historically misinformed. Finally, I addressed the differences in dress, noting that while attire varies culturally, Shia Muslims often wear black when mourning significant events, like Ashura. Overall, the discussion highlighted stereotypes, attire, and the importance of dialogue for understanding between the two groups.
