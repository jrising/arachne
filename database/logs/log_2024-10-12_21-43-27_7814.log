Maryam Saadatmand initially contacted Professor James Rising regarding eligibility for the Ph.D. programs in Environmental Economics or Marine Policy, highlighting her strong academic background and research interests. Professor Rising responded positively but mentioned funding constraints and suggested including his name in the statement of purpose. Maryam expressed her intent to take the IELTS instead of the Duolingo test for language proficiency. When she faced challenges due to the timing of her IELTS score, Professor Rising assured her that she could apply and submit her score later. Following her application, Professor Rising later indicated that her application to the Environmental Economics program might be less competitive due to a lack of multivariate calculus background, offering her the option to identify potential advisers through a provided link.
