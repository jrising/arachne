James encountered an issue on Ubuntu where the terminal reported an older version of R (3.2.2) despite having installed a newer version (4.4.0) using `sudo apt install r-base`. I advised him to check the location of the R binary, review installed versions, and possibly modify the PATH variable in his shell configuration file to ensure the newer version is prioritized. Upon discovering that Anacondaâ€™s R installation was found first in the PATH, I suggested either rearranging the PATH, removing R from Anaconda, or creating an alias for the system R. James confirmed he was considering removing R from Anaconda, and I confirmed that he could proceed with that if he preferred the system-wide installation instead.
