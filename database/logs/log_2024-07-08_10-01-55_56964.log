James asked about visualizing different Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) methods with uncertainties using Julia's Plots package. I suggested dot plots and error bars, troubleshooting errors with labels and plot orientation. I guided James on modifying the code for clarity and aesthetics, such as addressing overlapping labels by rotating the plot and moving the legend to the upper-right corner.
