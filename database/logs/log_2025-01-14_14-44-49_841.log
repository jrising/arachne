James sought assistance to enhance the impact of an email outlining a partnership proposal between IMT and the ESG team at Bank of America. The initial draft emphasized IMT's strategy to unite frontline communities with governments and the building industry for climate justice and affordable energy access. Key points included IMT's involvement with the Justice Climate Fund and the EPAâ€™s Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program, highlighting the provision of market development and training support. The revised email proposed a subject line that captured excitement and collaboration, reinforced the belief that "Better Buildings Transform Lives," and conveyed the goal of directing investments to urgent community needs. The outcome aimed to foster a strong partnership and inspire action towards an equitable, low-carbon future.
