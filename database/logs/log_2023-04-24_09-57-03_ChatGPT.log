In a previous conversation, James asked for a recommendation for an academic paper on machine learning techniques in the context of environmental economics. The AI assistant provided a paper titled "Machine Learning Methods for Environmental Economics: A Review" by Wolfram Schlenker and David A. Keiser. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of machine learning techniques, including LASSO, cross-validation, and random forests, and their potential to enhance empirical analyses in environmental economics. The authors provide examples and applications from the literature. The citation for the paper was also provided, along with a link to access it.
