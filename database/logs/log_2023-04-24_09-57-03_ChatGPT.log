James asked for a recommendation for an academic paper on machine learning techniques in the context of environmental economics. Arachne recommended the paper "Machine Learning Methods for Environmental Economics: A Review" by Schlenker and Keiser. The paper provides an overview of machine learning techniques such as LASSO, cross-validation, and random forests in environmental economics, and discusses their potential to improve empirical analyses in the field.
