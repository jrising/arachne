What are the stakes? 
• Thecentralchallengeofourtime • Global,invisibleexternalitydrivenbyeveryaspect 
of our economy 
• We’lldiscusslosses: 
		–  Harsher, more volatile world  
		–  Loss of coastal cities, islands, biodiversity  
		–  Top-down (economy-wide) and bottom-up (sector-by-  sector) impacts  
		–  Range of uncertainty and tipping points  
		–  Inequality, migration, politics, conflict

Battle lines 
Pro-climate change Pro-transition 
	•	Unfettered growth  
	•	Societal inertia  
	•	Climatic inertia  
	•	Free-riding incentives  
	•	The Trump factor  
	•	Shifting baselines  
	•	Uncertainty  
	•	Ease of geo-engineering  
• Technological innovation and learning 
– Cheaprenewablesand batteries, electric cars 
• Double/triple wins • UNFCCC process 
(Paris agreement) • Public support • Green competitiveness

Exciting transformation 
	•	We must transform to a ~0% fossil-fuel, ~100% renewable energy system  
	•	Thatcanresultinamoreequitable,healthier society  
	•	Climatewillcontinuetoevolvewithconsequent impacts  
	•	Every aspect of our lives will be forever changed, through a 2-generation-long society- wide effort  Climate Change Economics)  

Enter Climate Change Economics 
	•	What risks does society face from climate change?  
	•	How can people & firms adapt?  
	•	How can people & firms mitigate?  
	•	How should people & firms mitigate?  
	•	How will policies shape future emissions?  
	•	How can the international community coordinate to stop climate change?  Climate Change Economics)  

Core syllabus 
• Acomprehensiveguidetotheeconomic dimensions of climate change 
		–  fundamental concepts in climate science  
		–  estimating the future impacts of climate change on  economies and societies, and adaptation  
		–  mitigating climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions: estimating costs, designing policy instruments, implications for business  
		–  International cooperation • Anemphasisonquantitative,economicanalysis • Mostlynotdependentonpasteconomics

Some basic assumptions 
We will provide evidence or alternatives for many of these, but most of the content will assume: 
	•	Climatechangeishappeningandiscausedby human-driven GHG emissions.  
	•	Climatechangeisalreadyharmingpeople,andwe can mitigate these impacts by reducing emissions.  
	•	Oneofourgoalsaseconomistsistoincrease global human welfare.  
Climate Change Economics) 

Who might not be suited to the course? 
	•	If you are not broadly on-board with these assumptions.  
	•	Those of you with an aversion to numerical approaches  
	•	Those of you with a severe dislike of an economist’s way of thinking

Rigor in Climate Change Economics 
	•	Interactionsbetween climate change and economics are complex.  
	•	Simplegraphicalmodels are not much use.

Rigor in Climate Change Economics 
	•	Interactionsbetween climate change and economics are complex.  
	•	Simplegraphicalmodels are not much use.  
	•	ClimateChangeEconomics is interdisciplinary, engaging with natural science, complex physical and economic models.  Climate Change Economics)  
   

Rigor in Climate Change Economics (MAST 488/688) 
• Mygoalistointroduceyoutothefrontierof economic knowledge. 
• Also,wanttoexposeyoutomethodsbehindthat work. 
– Gridded circulation model data – Climate econometrics – Integrated assessment modeling – Game theory 
Climate Change Economics) 

Parallel approaches 
Lectures 
	•	Aimed at building intuition.  
	•	We assume at least ‘lay’ knowledge of economic concepts  – onmicro-economics:supply, demand, profit, etc.  – onmacro-economics:GDP, growth, etc.  
	•	I will include equations, but not alone.  
	•	We will present most issues graphically.  Climate Change Economics)  
Lab Assignments 
• Aimed at building experience. 
• Walking you through the steps in each analysis. 
• Questions to make you really understand the process and the results.

Climate Change Economics) 
Briefly summarize the paper (above) Are there problems with the methods? What is being missed? 

What sorts of question should I be able to answer after taking this course? 
	•	Which of the following sources of climate uncertainty is greatest by the end of the century? (a) initial condition, (b) emissions scenario, (c) model uncertainty.  
	•	What relationship, if any, exists between vulnerability to climate change and economic development?  
	•	When is cap & trade more efficient than a carbon tax?  
	•	What are the barriers to innovation of low-carbon technologies in the  power sector and what policy instruments might overcome them?  
	•	Critically evaluate the ‘pledge-and-review’ model of international cooperation on climate change. How might the Paris agreement result in a successful transition, and how might it fail?
