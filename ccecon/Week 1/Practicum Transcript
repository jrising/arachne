1
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.670
James Rising: We're doing our practice today right through.

2
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.529
James Rising: I'm not

3
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.520
James Rising: plans, but something

4
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.760
James Rising: you're doing. You're going to a party. I imagine.

5
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.500
James Rising: Yes. or 8.

6
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.490
James Rising: That's great.

7
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.020
James Rising: Never have too many tips for superf.

8
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.200
Exactly.

9
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.719
James Rising: I need to get the slight video fractal biases and scale goods.

10
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.770
James Rising: Oh, yeah, like instead of Falls

11
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.420
James Rising: and go to Costco way too often. so

12
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.340
James Rising: I don't think it's healthy, but

13
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.600
James Rising: the expected rush of

14
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.049
James Rising: Covid has started. We have

15
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.150
James Rising: one student choose who's already

16
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.430
James Rising: steam pump because of the Covid

17
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.390
James Rising: case.

18
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.110
James Rising: Hopefully, you guys will mostly miss it.

19
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.979
Sharp 120: You can keep.

20
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.320
Sharp 120: How's that close?

21
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.530
Sharp 120: Yeah.

22
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.740
Sharp 120: sure.

23
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:31.239
Sharp 120:  based on the it's a tickets. Tuesday. Looks like there's a there's a mix of experience. Number of beginners. Some people watch medias. I'm worried that people who

24
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:37.780
Sharp 120: already counts with our. We're gonna be report, I put in.

25
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.460
Sharp 120:  Some

26
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.240
Sharp 120: more advanced material which I think I think there's a way for people who already have

27
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:52.950
Sharp 120: know the basic material can can skip ahead to that but let me let me show you where first.

28
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.590
Sharp 120: So

29
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.830
Sharp 120: One of the great things about this.

30
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.780
Sharp 120: is that it has decent rendering of Jupiter Netflix.

31
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.640
Sharp 120: So our is

32
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:19.800
Sharp 120: let me back up ours a little system or application that runs on your computer. There are different interfaces. You can have 2 using our when you download or

33
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.020
Sharp 120: you, you'll get the basic interest. The basic interface looks like

34
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:35.010
Sharp 120: and and so it's not. There's there's not much going on, but actually it has most everything.

35
00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:39.949
Sharp 120:  where you can see that.

36
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.850
Sharp 120: There's a little there's a little carrot, and they can execute tomorrow in there and say

37
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.860
Sharp 120: 3

38
00:08:50.350 --> 00:09:06.380
Sharp 120:  But the way that most people use are is within our studio. Our studio has this window, and then it also has low window. For 20 variables. You have a window that's either used for

39
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.500
Sharp 120: for plots or for your help.

40
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.850
Sharp 120: And so what I would encourage you all to do.

41
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.449
Sharp 120: Yes, to

42
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.650
Sharp 120: demo both are and our CEO

43
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.690
Sharp 120: prosecution.

44
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.410
Sharp 120: And so that?

45
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.090
Sharp 120: Yeah.

46
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:34.319
Sharp 120: but more from the answer to okay. this is our studio.

47
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.960
See this

48
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.670
Sharp 120: myself. But this is our studio.

49
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.290
Sharp 120: There's my, there's my little or terminal

50
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:50.549
Sharp 120: variables. Here's the the help the whole teams a little bit of

51
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:59.489
Sharp 120: time to learn how to read. But there's tons of right. It's one of the great features of our is just how

52
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.790
Sharp 120: well documented everything is.

53
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.790
Sharp 120:  quick!

54
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:23.110
Sharp 120: Now I can tell you that another interface to our is Jupiter Notebooks, Jupiter notebooks are really useful for me to teach you things right. I can. I can put into the Jupiter notebook commands. I can run things that are. I can put graphs that I can make little documents to share with you.

55
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:31.480
Sharp 120: It's also important for you guys to use super notebooks the the setup for Jupiter notebooks in our is a bit of a

56
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.270
Sharp 120:  sort of pink.

57
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.569
Sharp 120: It it requires

58
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:44.530
Sharp 120: a future jump through. And half the time people run into problems. So

59
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.000
Sharp 120: just when you do it, I'm not going to

60
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.640
Sharp 120: encourage you to do it because it's

61
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.789
Sharp 120: but I'm gonna be using Jupiter notebook as my interface for showing

62
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:03.560
Sharp 120:  who here has our numbers need

63
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.579
Sharp 120: fantastic. Who's doing it through our studio?

64
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.270
Sharp 120: Just go.

65
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.590
Sharp 120: Okay, so I don't need to tell you about that.

66
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.779
Sharp 120: Okay, let's

67
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.310
Sharp 120: We do some basis basic stuff here.

68
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.099
Sharp 120: So quicker.

69
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.089
Sharp 120: Right? So

70
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:37.880
Sharp 120: or use calculator and do a lot of other things. But you could do any sort of basic arithmetic.

71
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.400
Sharp 120: So here

72
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.299
Sharp 120: one plus number.

73
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.750
Sharp 120: either one

74
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.460
Sharp 120: by the way.

75
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.500
Sharp 120: it also knows how to do measuring numbers.

76
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.860
Sharp 120: That's if you want to.

77
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.450
Sharp 120: and then the first one each the one. Is it less than pi?

78
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.790
Sharp 120: You do the ones

79
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:10.909
Sharp 120: 2.22 8 4, and so gave me

80
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.170
Sharp 120: the same truth.

81
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:19.979
Sharp 120: True, in our is a different type of thing than than a number

82
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:25.270
Sharp 120: uses the number. But our has

83
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.070
Sharp 120: or as a set of fundamental types, core types, that

84
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.860
Sharp 120: that, everything also, too.

85
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.489
Sharp 120: So everything, everything pulls. It's different. So

86
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.210
Sharp 120: let's let's look at that. So

87
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.649
Sharp 120: we can ask, what is the type of this number? It's a new member

88
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.830
Sharp 120: that's dumber.

89
00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:02.170
Sharp 120: What is the task of the string. 3. I know it's a string, because I put it with double quotes single books. It says, Oh.

90
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.940
Sharp 120: that's a character stream just calls it a character.

91
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.379
Sharp 120: And then this thing I got back from

92
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.850
Sharp 120: X one plus some pi. That's that's a logical.

93
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:20.439
Sharp 120: It's it's only so. If I say here the class of export and assistant pay.

94
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:31.660
Sharp 120: and I'll also say, Okay, that thing. That expression evaluated it. I got back to True. I think you then ask before the request. That was, it's logical.

95
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.959
Sharp 120: So there you go.

96
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:43.340
Sharp 120:  People who. or just starting with learning language, programming languages.

97
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.829
often get confused about how to

98
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.000
Sharp 120: evaluate something in their head.

99
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.210
Sharp 120: I suspect that all of you have had

100
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:57.449
Sharp 120: another experience, that that you already know this, but the way that maybe you evaluate something your head.

101
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:03.020
Sharp 120: That is the way that you do the the thing with computers doing so that you can get same answer

102
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.660
Sharp 120: is, you start with

103
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:13.180
Sharp 120: the innermost things, and then build it out from there and get the results of something. I mean, get the results. So

104
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.409
Sharp 120: even something like pi.

105
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.830
Sharp 120: so the the the letters. PI.

106
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:33.200
Sharp 120: It's a. It's a variable. It's not something that our immediately goes with what it is. And so the first thing does is it says, Okay, well, what are all the things here? So I'm gonna look at Pi, and we're just see. Oh, it's a variable thing is 3.1 4

107
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:40.389
Sharp 120: and so now I can. I can over here. I can run this. Okay, what is

108
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.349
Sharp 120: the exponents? Sorry, either

109
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:49.779
Sharp 120: one. And so then I've got 2 numbers at the site here, I could take my comparison.

110
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.599
Sharp 120: And then, you know, I've got

111
00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:59.220
Sharp 120: that's gonna that's gonna give me the value for this whole piece, and then I can do next level and get the value for that.

112
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.060
Sharp 120:  I claim that pi was a variable.

113
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.819
I hope

114
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.669
Sharp 120: so. I'm gonna say, that pi is actually

115
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.710
Sharp 120: 2.

116
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.619
Sharp 120: I'm going to do this again. Just so.

117
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.410
Sharp 120: be selected.

118
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:27.190
Sharp 120: Oh, God, alright! So I was right. Propose praise variable. So our apparently has a bunch of variables that are that are booked.

119
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:38.530
Sharp 120: It turns out that in our also all functions are just variables. So here I re defined the value of pi to be 2.

120
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.990
Sharp 120: Now.

121
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.760
Sharp 120: either the one is. don't listen to it.

122
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.940
but meaning not in there.

123
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.220
Sharp 120: Since I've started the second to to

124
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:58.960
Sharp 120: conclusion. Let's redefine the exponent function.

125
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:08.370
Sharp 120: I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna say that the exponent function way that you define a function or as you

126
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.320
Sharp 120: function thing, give it documents, and you see what the value of it is.

127
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.009
Sharp 120: Now I can do this again.

128
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.960
Sharp 120: Oh, good

129
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.600
Sharp 120: now, user one is once they must comply, or at least one is listening to.

130
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.270
Sharp 120: which is almost as good.

131
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.210
Sharp 120:  okay.

132
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.369
Sharp 120: questions about

133
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.939
Sharp 120: it's very simple stuff.

134
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.390
Sharp 120: I see, very simple, but but obviously I'm I'm doing some sort of things here. But

135
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.469
Sharp 120: do you mean us?

136
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.369
Sharp 120: We're too much about doing yourselves except hopefully you. You follow what I did there.

137
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.460
Sharp 120: Sure. Okay.

138
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.280
Sharp 120: so hmm.

139
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:19.230
Sharp 120:  I already use this. But

140
00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.140
Sharp 120: introduce you to variables, variables, or names for things.

141
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.650
Sharp 120: We can put anything into a variable

142
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.389
Sharp 120: Ethan that has a value.

143
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:35.270
Sharp 120: So I mean. ask what the value of a is

144
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.450
Sharp 120:  in

145
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.009
Sharp 120: it's

146
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.640
Sharp 120: common practice in, or

147
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.010
Sharp 120: to rather than use the equal sign to use this little

148
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.599
Sharp 120: set simple arrow. They need the same thing.

149
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.340
Sharp 120: The the reason why

150
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.400
Sharp 120: prefer the set, simple speaker sign is because

151
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.720
Sharp 120: a lot of people we're using our petitions. They

152
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:16.020
Sharp 120: see there as the difference between the mutation operation

153
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:22.219
Sharp 120: which is setting something and the often equal is is

154
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.369
Sharp 120: test operation.

155
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:33.670
Sharp 120:  to do. There's not one duty, though, because to do the so

156
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.389
Sharp 120: equal and and error mean the exact same thing.

157
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.100
Sharp 120:  no one to

158
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.590
Sharp 120: will be watching our 4

159
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:58.769
Sharp 120:  Usually, when we're doing statistics more than one number.

160
00:18:59.060 --> 00:18:59.960
Sharp 120: Well.

161
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:16.240
Sharp 120: we have to have a way to represent a bunch of numbers the way that we do that is, with vectors. Vectors are not as you may have learned when years go in high school little arrows, but they are just numbers

162
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.770
Sharp 120: to make a list of numbers. We use the concatenation function. C,

163
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:30.510
Sharp 120: and so we say, see what you before. Let me get a picture of this 4 values long, and it has

164
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:37.610
Sharp 120:  but it just it. Just bring it back up. So let's set it

165
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.349
Sharp 120: set X equal to

166
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:46.550
Sharp 120: some numbers. several different numbers. And then we can do things with it. And in general.

167
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:56.029
Sharp 120: when you do something to a, vector, you're gonna do something to every value with that. Vector it's just going to to treat the operation that you're doing

168
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:10.840
Sharp 120: as as something that that applies to each one. So when I say, X is this, and then X is the inspector, Xx plus one is going to be adding 122-34-5235 and 7.

169
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:19.630
Sharp 120: Okay. similarly. 2 times xxx. Xxx. Square.

170
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.830
Sharp 120: as you'd expect.

171
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.860
Sharp 120: I can also

172
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.430
Sharp 120: do things with

173
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:34.440
Sharp 120: 2 vectors together. Let's see what happens if I

174
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.929
Sharp 120: missed that up, though. So what if I

175
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.660
Sharp 120: take? Why, I put 5 members in there.

176
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:48.030
Sharp 120: and now I try to multiply these 2 together. and it says.

177
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.530
Sharp 120: no problem. I'll do that for you. I'll give you a warning. The warning is that

178
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.940
Sharp 120: you have 2 objects

179
00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:04.549
Sharp 120: phrases that way.

180
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.660
Sharp 120: but it gave me

181
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.389
Sharp 120: 2, 6, 5, 28, which is simply here, and then 10.

182
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.810
Sharp 120: But it can be 10.

183
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.720
Yes.

184
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:33.480
Sharp 120: yeah, exactly. Exactly. So it loops

185
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.500
Sharp 120: the

186
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.350
Sharp 120: the previous vector

187
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:44.989
Sharp 120: and so you can imagine you know sorts of some things. With that you could say, Okay, I just want

188
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:50.150
Sharp 120:  to multiply one and 2.

189
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.950
Sharp 120: Alright, how much of the numbers? Let's say

190
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.179
Sharp 120: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

191
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:04.769
Sharp 120: Yeah, no, it doesn't give me a warning. It just says, Okay, one times 3,

192
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.630
Sharp 120: 3, 2 times 4 is 8, one times 5 is 5, 2 times 6 is 12.

193
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.630
Sharp 120:  this can this

194
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:25.799
Sharp 120: powerful it it's it's part of the paradigm of our that that there is this ability to to repeat things, and why it's white for the paradigm is that when I was multiplying, for example.

195
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.710
Sharp 120: was multiplying

196
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:35.640
Sharp 120: 2 by X up here, actually, the way to think about that is, is it just kind of repeating the 2.

197
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.949
Sharp 120: But it's treated you just like a vector sort of treats. Everything like

198
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:50.199
Sharp 120:  The reason it's so powerful dangerous versus dangerous is that if you happen to

199
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.499
Sharp 120: have 2 things are different links, but you

200
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.759
Sharp 120: just to happen to have them as the multiples of each other.

201
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.029
Sharp 120: and they they have what is

202
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:11.130
Sharp 120: a common home there, I guess. Then then it won't give you an error. It will just do the operation whether you message to that later or not.

203
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.150
Sharp 120: Okay,

204
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:24.980
Sharp 120: basic arithmetic with with vectors. we can also apply, vector, we play virtual vectors

205
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:36.440
Sharp 120: and get out actual numbers. It's mean of X. It's meaning of X.  All my companies class recognize this.

206
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:42.559
Sharp 120: So those of you who work my complete stuff. What am I doing with this?

207
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.640
Sharp 120: But some square errors

208
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.699
Sharp 120: especially. It's important.

209
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.949
Sharp 120: It's related. But then all census related.

210
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:15.370
Sharp 120: it's yeah. So if I if I drop this

211
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.700
Sharp 120: per route.

212
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.619
Sharp 120: then that would be the variance.

213
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.320
Sharp 120: yeah.

214
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:34.459
Sharp 120: bias. But

215
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.019
Sharp 120: square root of this.

216
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.969
Sharp 120: Okay? And let's see if I got the right answer.

217
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.100
Sharp 120: See?

218
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:56.059
Sharp 120: Alright. Okay. So so deviation is also just production.

219
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.399
Sharp 120:  no magic here.

220
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:16.350
Sharp 120: except that there's a there's no mix of vectors and numbers. So Meanbecks takes a this mean takes a vector if that number

221
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:21.080
Sharp 120: and we're taking, we're subtracting the mean off of every value in X,

222
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.010
Sharp 120: that the result of that is still, vector

223
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.869
Sharp 120: then we square every value. Isn't that so that's a vector again.

224
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:37.390
Sharp 120: then some is just like being that it takes a vector. Returns a single number. So this

225
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.520
Sharp 120: some.

226
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:49.500
Sharp 120: It's your number this over here. So this is a number. So

227
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:56.439
Sharp 120: you often have to be a little aware about whether the function you're using

228
00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:07.009
Sharp 120: takes number of a troops. Number is, if you do that implied to a, vector it's going to give you back another. Vector or if it takes a vector which case it will, it will collapse your vector

229
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.770
Sharp 120: it's just

230
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.410
Sharp 120: to speak. That's that's the thing II wrote, except I used to have minus one

231
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.700
Sharp 120: here. Which is

232
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.430
Sharp 120: But not apparently in Okay.

233
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.600
Sharp 120: okay.

234
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:42.740
Sharp 120:  Alright. X was was 2, 3, 5, 7, first, 4 times

235
00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.469
Sharp 120: what. So what's this? Gonna do.

236
00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.859
Sharp 120: Xxx is less than 5. Once I 42 give me as a of value

237
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.320
Sharp 120: irresponsible.

238
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.100
Sharp 120: false. It's

239
00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:10.189
Sharp 120: so less than is not one of these things that takes a vector returns a single value actually is going to apply every

240
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.440
Sharp 120: within. X

241
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.809
Sharp 120: says that she can give me true to false false.

242
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:32.010
Sharp 120: And again, that's going to be useful when we want to index into  needs of vectors which have a workout.

243
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.689
Sharp 120: Okay? So

244
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.420
Sharp 120: okay. so

245
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:49.329
Sharp 120: we've got the sectors. We don't know how to type values into them. We don't have them.

246
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:58.819
Sharp 120: this feature here is going to help us when we want to point out individual numbers or change individual numbers.

247
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.710
Sharp 120: A a, vector so

248
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.110
Sharp 120: you are

249
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:11.300
Sharp 120: to index into X, you uses for packets. So first and one based.

250
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.850
Sharp 120: So the first

251
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.160
Sharp 120: number in there is 2,

252
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.280
Sharp 120: 7,

253
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.710
Sharp 120: and that makes it interesting. So

254
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.809
Sharp 120: we can also do

255
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:37.599
Sharp 120: we could put in here rather than a single number. And if that vector is a vector of numbers that's going to give us the value added to those points. So

256
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:44.669
Sharp 120: C, 203 is vector, 2, 3 is going to give us

257
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.889
Sharp 120: second, the third.

258
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:48.910
Sharp 120: that's reasonable.

259
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.880
Sharp 120:  we can also, we can save. So

260
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.929
Sharp 120: CM, 2, 3

261
00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:04.430
Sharp 120: is 2, 3.

262
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.360
Sharp 120: Okay.

263
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.760
Sharp 120: so we can also do that.

264
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.000
Sharp 120: And then

265
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.890
Sharp 120: what what should this one do like? If if if everything

266
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.640
Sharp 120: hopefully, we want it to work

267
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.070
Sharp 120: always exits of true, true, false, false give!

268
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.440
Sharp 120: How would you like that to work?

269
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.719
Sharp 120: Just return first it.

270
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.089
Sharp 120: And and and the reason why it's on off the team. So that's that's exactly what it does.

271
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.850
Sharp 120: It gives. It gives, it returns

272
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:51.210
Sharp 120: the value wherever there's true. And the reason that that's the way you want to do it is because then we can see things like.

273
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:58.570
Sharp 120: give me the values like tax. for which Xx is less than 5. And

274
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.290
Sharp 120: you know, this is something that you can just for free. But actually, it also figure out, okay, what's

275
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:11.880
Sharp 120: why is it that it gave me the thing I wanted to give me all those values. X, there must provide. Because

276
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.059
Sharp 120: so if I gave me

277
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:21.129
Sharp 120: and then

278
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.390
Sharp 120: alright, okay.

279
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.850
Sharp 120: that's all

280
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.620
Sharp 120: the basic vector stuff I wanted to say, and then we can put plug in this

281
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.900
Sharp 120: questions.

282
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.059
Sharp 120: So I should

283
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.540
Sharp 120: to.

284
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.660
Sharp 120: because this is basic stuff. But

285
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.619
Sharp 120: maybe for even for those of you who

286
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.670
Sharp 120: who already experienced that they it's useful to to go into again.

287
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.390
Sharp 120: Okay,

288
00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:09.120
Sharp 120: There are lots of funny packages in our plenty, the perhaps the most advanced weight plot in the universe. Which is called Gdp plot is

289
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:18.510
Sharp 120: package. When I bless my toddler, I jump straight to G, did you? Because

290
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:23.589
Sharp 120: this is beautiful graphics universe?

291
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.420
Sharp 120: I think it's

292
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:36.009
Sharp 120: probably a a a level extra complication that we don't really need in terms of that. That ours

293
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.059
Sharp 120: built in plotting is perfectly acceptable as long as you don't want to show.

294
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:42.920
Sharp 120: So

295
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:52.029
Sharp 120: the the key function in our is called platform and

296
00:31:53.450 --> 00:32:00.080
Sharp 120: first, I want you. It's useful. the the help for what if I put into our any

297
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.769
Sharp 120: a question mark and then any function you'll give me help.

298
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:05.429
It's true.

299
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.969
Sharp 120: Which in my

300
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.210
Sharp 120: a

301
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.259
Sharp 120: in my Jupyter notebook, gives me this error as well. But

302
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.899
Sharp 120: don't happen to you. So it says, Okay, great.

303
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:29.219
Sharp 120: You want to know about plot. I will tell you about what is the default. Scatterplot function draws a scatterplot with decorations such as acts, titles, and active products will do

304
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:42.150
Sharp 120: great things.  and then it says, Okay, here are all the things that you give me. You can give me just a single thing.

305
00:32:42.170 --> 00:33:03.850
Sharp 120: X, actually, if you give it just one thing, it's going to. Well, we'll see. What does it. It's gonna assume that you're actually giving it. Why, values? And it's gonna say that the X rays are just numbers from one still into the Y values. But usually you'll do it with an X value. And then there's a bunch of other things about, how do you want those? Some

306
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.190
Sharp 120: those points to show up? What kind tool that's you want or your axes.

307
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.319
Sharp 120: One axe is.

308
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.550
Sharp 120: or spacing. that's a specific and it explains all these.

309
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.700
Sharp 120: if you want to do it.

310
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.940
Sharp 120: What I find more useful. Usually the explanations is

311
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:37.260
Sharp 120: that in with all the the documentation, our examples, and and there are built in data sets in order to make it pretty easy to use.

312
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:43.090
Sharp 120: except that is not only built in but pre loaded.

313
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.849
Sharp 120: It's also interesting to know.

314
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.679
Sharp 120:  So there's this. There's this nice

315
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.470
Sharp 120: data set of

316
00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:57.459
Sharp 120:   speeds and distances for some kind of

317
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:09.409
Sharp 120:  I shot it speeding and stopping distances. Of course. 1920. S, we do.

318
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:16.310
Sharp 120: Okay. so let's let's just that's

319
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.380
Sharp 120: okay.

320
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.699
Sharp 120: So just missed

321
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:31.299
Sharp 120: the plot of X. By the way, I always I I always

322
00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.060
Sharp 120: bright

323
00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:49.000
Sharp 120: XYA. As double letters, just because II find it easier to look through my code later to to do searches to record and stuff. But III call this thing, and I wrote Xx. As X. This is a

324
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.690
Sharp 120: and

325
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.270
Sharp 120: thing I do. It has nothing to do with

326
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:59.350
Sharp 120: with with our so I said, Plus x.

327
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:09.680
Sharp 120: Then it said, Okay, great. You'll give me one thing. You gave me the numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. And since you can give me, tell me where they're supposed to go

328
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.300
Sharp 120: fine, I'll put them as XI use 1, 2, 3, 4,

329
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.350
so

330
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.629
Sharp 120:  We could have.

331
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.680
Sharp 120: Finally, that same thing if you said.

332
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.870
Sharp 120: looking forward, X,

333
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:44.189
Sharp 120:  yeah. So, and then we'll come into here. Plug XY takes 2 vectors, and plus y versus x.

334
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:51.870
Sharp 120: So I can also products against other things like 4, 6, 8, and

335
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.220
Sharp 120: tax access. Let's see

336
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.690
Sharp 120: difference.

337
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:03.010
Sharp 120:  I can do some things like

338
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.909
Sharp 120: plot executes itself. And when I do that.

339
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:19.779
Sharp 120:  2, 2, 50

340
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.810
Sharp 120: and then, just to show you a couple of the the basic

341
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:31.769
Sharp 120:  formatting options I can put in

342
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.840
Sharp 120: X and Y access labels.

343
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.080
Sharp 120: Huh?

344
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:46.799
Sharp 120: I can say, rather than those little Swiss circles. Please make it a line. So

345
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:58.379
Sharp 120: plot the function has a few different kinds of plots I can do. They're all very basic, except showing them to anyone. They're they're usually everything you need. But

346
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.260
Sharp 120:  nothing's very pretty.

347
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:08.289
Sharp 120: and so this is.

348
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.720
Sharp 120: It is

349
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.890
Sharp 120: and

350
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.050
Sharp 120: you just

351
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.180
Sharp 120: so.

352
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:25.969
Sharp 120:  the mobile bars each

353
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.790
Sharp 120: each. And

354
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.970
Sharp 120: I think I may have this bloke. But

355
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:41.320
Sharp 120: you go to change what that will. Symbol is. That is used when we're doing that.

356
00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.770
Sharp 120:  a basic

357
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.450
Sharp 120: and that's with the PC. Pc. Is

358
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.030
roll your version

359
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:05.010
Sharp 120: one more second. We have before 2, 2 little triangles, 3

360
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.320
Sharp 120: plus signs.

361
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.810
Sharp 120: access, and so on. I think my

362
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.780
Sharp 120: prefer 1 16, which is

363
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:14.820
Sharp 120: thoughts.

364
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.460
Sharp 120: circles.

365
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.080
Sharp 120:  But

366
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:37.030
Sharp 120: once I've created this most recent is this one I can add additional things to it again add license

367
00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.530
Sharp 120: with the audience.

368
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.950
Sharp 120:  yeah.

369
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.400
Sharp 120: put these both in the same.

370
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.119
Sharp 120: and for

371
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.140
Sharp 120: you'll be able to do this better.

372
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.099
Sharp 120: There we go. So

373
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:04.370
Sharp 120: if I run first the plug band in the that's where you.

374
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.080
Sharp 120: If I do.

375
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.990
Sharp 120: then it will. Let's do

376
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.900
Sharp 120: pch. One

377
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:23.490
Sharp 120: triangles both the dots haven't triangles each other.

378
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:30.409
Sharp 120: and just for fun. There's also a name for helping you with them.

379
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:40.079
Sharp 120: 54. But I'm just making 10 triangles over little dots.

380
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.990
Sharp 120: Sure. So

381
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.159
Sharp 120: that is very basic plotting

382
00:39:51.220 --> 00:40:02.339
Sharp 120:  arithmetic. And now, I need to ask you guys to.

383
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.200
Sharp 120: So

384
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.349
Sharp 120: this is

385
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.199
Sharp 120: you go on to

386
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:19.209
Sharp 120: Let me just tell you. Tell you what the things are. You can either click through

387
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.529
on the github.

388
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.919
Sharp 120: or you can.

389
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:25.330
Sharp 120: great, and

390
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:34.229
Sharp 120: just take into your browser. By the way, so

391
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.340
Sharp 120: we're going to be using

392
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:41.769
Sharp 120: this github propulsory for other times. I want to share cool with you, or

393
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.810
Sharp 120: and it is

394
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:52.270
Sharp 120: at github.com slash models slash ccecon, 22

395
00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.560
Sharp 120: hopefully, you should be able to to get there, and and

396
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.430
Sharp 120: all the stuff that I've been showing you is the speaker introducing our

397
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.019
Sharp 120: notebook. So there.

398
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.330
Sharp 120: just like we said search

399
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.279
Sharp 120: without all the

400
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:16.499
Sharp 120: so if we went there you could just look into

401
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.200
Sharp 120: my claim feature.

402
00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:27.800
Sharp 120: Okay, so why do I want you to consider you to actually do

403
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.330
Sharp 120: with this? So

404
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:37.200
Sharp 120:  one of the things that we that we briefly looked at

405
00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:43.820
Sharp 120: doing introduction was how the risk of different hazards, different

406
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.979
Sharp 120: time. It's logical events is gonna increase

407
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.000
Sharp 120: for somebody to sleep over the course of your lifetime.

408
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.240
Sharp 120: So how widespread! It's kind of change

409
00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.820
Sharp 120: well. when we're when we're born.

410
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.260
Sharp 120:  I was

411
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.150
Sharp 120: definitely more than 2,000,

412
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.819
Sharp 120: just a 0.

413
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.630
Sharp 120:  She tried

414
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:20.100
Sharp 120: and then I can say, Okay, what's my morning scenario? And what region would I like to

415
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.749
Sharp 120: to look at if I?

416
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.830
Sharp 120: I was 24 year old.

417
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.910
Sharp 120: So why is it 24 years old? Because

418
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:52.889
Sharp 120: year 2,000 will experience these increases because it's been to the world that they can w refer to you

419
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.950
Sharp 120: if I put this up to

420
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.400
Sharp 120: as a 4 year old

421
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.340
Sharp 120: second. That's not the way experts

422
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.130
Sharp 120: what's going on here.

423
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:18.310
Sharp 120:  alright!

424
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:24.099
Sharp 120: How many more?

425
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.600
Sharp 120: That's fine.

426
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:32.110
Sharp 120: which I'll try. I you when I first.

427
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:42.980
Sharp 120: This is over the course of your lifetime. What are you gonna experience depending on what kind of a world we're gonna have. So

428
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.170
Sharp 120: if I were born into 2,000, then

429
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:53.130
Sharp 120: over the course of my lifetime, as we get into world, I'm gonna have

430
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.779
Sharp 120: all these, all these increases, and if I then scroll this off to the right.

431
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.240
Sharp 120: then

432
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.830
Sharp 120: those numbers all increase the one.

433
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:13.930
Sharp 120: It's usually because we're stabilizing temperatures pretty rapidly. But increase a little bit because

434
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:20.960
Sharp 120: still very warm. So much here. So the world, the 4 year old

435
00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:29.219
Sharp 120: of today. We're the third experience that someone who was born back in 2,006.

436
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:39.770
Sharp 120:  you also do. Clinic promises are the things that governments have said they're going to do under the

437
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.549
Sharp 120: you never will see you under the

438
00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.580
Sharp 120: so

439
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:48.670
Sharp 120: those things that they've said they're gonna do or

440
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.309
Sharp 120:  Well, we don't know if they're actually gonna do them.

441
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:58.370
Sharp 120: They're not everything that would you need to get down to, even to 2 to 3 world. But there's something.

442
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.089
Sharp 120: and a high warming world

443
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.579
Sharp 120: is point 3.5 degrees

444
00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.319
Sharp 120: year 2,100.

445
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.130
Sharp 120: So

446
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.099
Sharp 120: let's see

447
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.990
shooting.

448
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:20.349
Sharp 120: I guess they're terrible.

449
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:25.270
Sharp 120:  okay, so

450
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.149
Sharp 120: really want you to do that.

451
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.219
Sharp 120:  what are you here for?

452
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:38.270
Sharp 120: Region of interest? I was showing you both for all those but

453
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.100
Sharp 120: things.

454
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:46.890
Sharp 120:  then record just one number the number of the increase in keywords. So if it's

455
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:52.800
Sharp 120: 14.7 x, then 14.7,

456
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:56.349
Sharp 120: and then

457
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.960
Sharp 120: change costs wonderful.

458
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:06.419
Sharp 120: Go through the other 2 forming scenarios record. The

459
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.730
Sharp 120: Google will be mobile. So sure without scenario

460
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.370
Sharp 120: and the increasing fees, and then you'll have

461
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.700
Sharp 120: some numbers that look someone like us

462
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.930
Sharp 120: forming heat waves.

463
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:25.380
Sharp 120: Oh, and I've added here warming of 0

464
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:35.210
Sharp 120: one, the one number that that they're not gonna give you is the 1 0 is gonna give you a heat. Waves of one X. No no further change.

465
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.780
Sharp 120: Okay. so

466
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.689
Sharp 120: pick those vectors.

467
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.350
Sharp 120: pop them.

468
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.519
Sharp 120: Yes. says on 12

469
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:08.580
check

470
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:16.240
Sharp 120: city report a year.

471
00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.720
Sharp 120: please.

472
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:27.949
Sharp 120: Sorry. What's the deal? It's well, it actually shows it up there. No, it doesn't do it right. It's

473
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.060
Sharp 120: It's open models. Slash

474
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:36.930
Sharp 120: slash. CC on 2024.

475
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.680
Sharp 120: She's the complementary form

476
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.310
Sharp 120: and get you sort of

477
00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.610
Sharp 120: is that does that work. and

478
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.449
Sharp 120: to try to believe that

479
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.190
he's comfortable.

480
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.400
Sharp 120: Yeah. So it's it's Github. Sorry.

481
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.560
Sharp 120: That's all right.

482
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:21.790
Sharp 120: Full breakfast.

483
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.640
The

484
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.269
Sharp 120: slash. Tcp.

485
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:49.810
Sharp 120: you guys get pictures.

486
00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.410
Sharp 120: Give you one moment.

487
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:48.169
Sharp 120: Okay, so the first thing I want to do is just plot the data

488
00:49:55.350 --> 00:50:01.620
Sharp 120: lost opportunity. But we don't do something more with it. So this is.

489
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:04.020
Sharp 120: dig a

490
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.720
Sharp 120:  and at least for mine.

491
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.180
Sharp 120: There's this

492
00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:20.690
Sharp 120: rapid increase up to but 5 degrees. Continue web. Decrease up to 2.5 degrees, and then things sort of

493
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.490
Sharp 120: level off that. What everyone's looks like

494
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:42.920
Sharp 120: point 4 to 3.5.

495
00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.869
Sharp 120: Yeah, I've seen that. I don't know why.

496
00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:48.770
Yeah.

497
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:57.100
Sharp 120: But did you choose a super per region? Or.

498
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.320
Sharp 120: yeah.

499
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:08.320
Sharp 120: in the regions? You do see

500
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:14.999
Sharp 120: particular areas. They, you know, the the warm.

501
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:19.290
Sharp 120: They're warming doesn't necessarily correlate exactly with the global warming.

502
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:25.359
Sharp 120: So it's gonna generally build this injection. But it could be just North America

503
00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:33.129
Sharp 120: is expected to cool for some portion of. But after

504
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.060
Sharp 120: what's my best guess?

505
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:40.479
Sharp 120: Well, why does it level off after like 2.5?

506
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.830
Sharp 120: It's so. What is

507
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.269
Sharp 120: the the way that this is

508
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:55.650
Sharp 120: the way that's the final key waves is

509
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.980
Sharp 120: as a a a

510
00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.270
Sharp 120: deviation.

511
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.780
Sharp 120: Basically, it's asking, what are the skills look like.

512
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:05.820
Sharp 120: And

513
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:13.350
Sharp 120: here are temperatures, the way that they. So here is the circle beam

514
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:18.819
Sharp 120: and anything above some, let's say.

515
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.079
Sharp 120: 3 standard negations.

516
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:27.429
Sharp 120: This new plus is gonna be concerted with

517
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:29.920
Sharp 120: you.

518
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:36.040
Sharp 120:  If we then how much more meet!

519
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.309
Sharp 120: And then this whole thing sets.

520
00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:41.830
Sharp 120: and this whole segment here.

521
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.380
Sharp 120: this one could be

522
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.400
Sharp 120: some larger amounts of

523
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.580
Sharp 120: sorry. So then, this for here

524
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.429
Sharp 120: 8 and this total right here.

525
00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.090
Sharp 120: he's gonna tell you, okay, what's the the speed? By the way.

526
00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:11.539
Sharp 120: Now it could be that. You're getting the slowly off. because we're sort of

527
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.910
Sharp 120: getting

528
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:18.300
Sharp 120: past this point where we already teach out most of this area.

529
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:22.769
Sharp 120: And for the work is not giving us that much more to wait.

530
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:31.429
Sharp 120:  It could also be that this picture is should be natural data, a lot more

531
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:41.979
Sharp 120: very full, the one I've actually shown. And so you know, some some particular movements back and forth of this distribution.

532
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.819
That's that's a general 37.

533
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:50.600
Sharp 120: Okay, so

534
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:55.240
Sharp 120:  what would be

535
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.470
Sharp 120: to do now?

536
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.840
Sharp 120: Is to say, Okay.

537
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.210
Sharp 120: what?

538
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:10.800
Sharp 120: What does that look like? Just numbers? I'm curious about.

539
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.870
Sharp 120: how

540
00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:26.910
Sharp 120:  Oh, big of an increase is that? Is that gonna be so quick looking forward. So one thing that we can do is we can plug that thing and then add onto an extra line.

541
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.930
Sharp 120: which is.

542
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:31.410
Sharp 120:  oops

543
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:32.770
Sharp 120: do

544
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.450
Sharp 120: one to.

545
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:39.920
Sharp 120: And

546
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.460
Sharp 120: we're going to say, well, what if

547
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.480
Sharp 120: let's just let's let's start. Let's start with linear

548
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:53.029
Sharp 120: with, we're basically saying every degree for me.

549
00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:58.860
Sharp 120: we're going to increase by. So by 5 times more

550
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.929
Sharp 120: keyways. So that's what you said.

551
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.080
Charlotte. Shoreline.

552
00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.220
Sharp 120: Amy. Nope.

553
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.730
Sharp 120: not only is my line up. We don't go back to 0, but it's so much.

554
00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:20.960
Sharp 120: Let's go 0 4, and let's double this. There we go.

555
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:29.449
Sharp 120: So it looks like something like 30 degrees for me. Might be we have about 10 times increase in

556
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:34.160
Sharp 120: the number of cells. but he waves. is like

557
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:37.819
Sharp 120: could figure out, let's just say that. Okay, that's

558
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.860
Sharp 120: 1.5 degrees. I already had 14.7

559
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:46.370
Sharp 120:  Hello!

560
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.380
Sharp 120: Risk ratio of 14.7. So

561
00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.419
Sharp 120: so pretty easy, easily done.

562
00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:59.240
Sharp 120: What else should we do with it? I was thinking that we would like.

563
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.540
Sharp 120: like

564
00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:04.700
Sharp 120: good, nice, exponential there, but without getting into that

565
00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:06.309
Sharp 120: doing proper.

566
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.240
Sharp 120: Kind of metrics. I'm having second thoughts about it.

567
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.930
Sharp 120: Alright, let's just let's just launch it.

568
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.840
Sharp 120: The last couple of things I wanted to tell you about.

569
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:19.940
Sharp 120: right?

570
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.650
Sharp 120: So

571
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.529
Sharp 120: I'm gonna spend probably another

572
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:37.869
Sharp 120: 10 min on this and then talk to you a little bit more about the

573
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.089
Sharp 120: So I'm not gonna do too much more stuff.

574
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:46.869
Sharp 120: You know. I told you about vectors I haven't told you about data sets.

575
00:56:46.970 --> 00:57:00.159
Sharp 120: data sets in our observation. And so

576
00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.199
Sharp 120: one thing we do is

577
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.449
Sharp 120: crates are a little different.

578
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:13.159
Sharp 120: has 2 variables. Temperature temperature is 3 degrees 5 degrees or 7 degrees

579
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:18.370
Sharp 120: 3, 4 type, 5 dollars, $6. $7.

580
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:22.889
Sharp 120: Data dot frame is how we create the data frame.

581
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:29.850
Sharp 120: And then we say, Okay, what's the first?

582
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.830
Sharp 120: And then we can reach out and says, Okay.

583
00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:34.729
Sharp 120: Nope.

584
00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:54.260
Sharp 120:  by the way, plus, there's something about how to take data. For instance, we can also say, plus the okay.

585
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:56.380
Sharp 120: I'm sure

586
00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:58.320
Sharp 120: it's not

587
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.330
Sharp 120: now.

588
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.630
Sharp 120: I'm gonna ask you to read a file just a minute. So

589
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:16.340
Sharp 120: let's also know how to break files. Those 3 kinds of

590
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:23.059
Sharp 120: the easiest kind of file to read right? Because it's the most

591
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:26.020
Sharp 120: a interoperable

592
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:30.470
Sharp 120: is a Csv file comment separated file.

593
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:35.310
Sharp 120: So I'm going to write out my data frame to

594
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.490
Sharp 120: my filebot. Csv.

595
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.459
Sharp 120: I wanna show you this file that just created

596
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:47.059
Sharp 120: don't work for

597
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.300
Sharp 120: the

598
00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:53.490
Sharp 120: there we go. So

599
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.050
Sharp 120: there's my port, and there's my file, my file about 6 feet.

600
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:09.880
Sharp 120: and if I open that on my back, it says, Oh, Csv files, surely the way that you want to look at that is with Excel.

601
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:15.330
Sharp 120: And there it says, Okay, here's a nice little tool.

602
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:19.050
Sharp 120: Spreadsheet with

603
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.420
Sharp 120: awesome

604
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.969
Sharp 120: looks like

605
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.880
Sharp 120: text edit

606
00:59:29.410 --> 00:59:31.739
Sharp 120: and see what it actually looks like.

607
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.309
Sharp 120: This big

608
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:50.979
Sharp 120:  so the reason it's called the comma separated file is because separated. The first row is the is the header row.

609
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:57.430
Sharp 120: and it says, Okay, I've got 3 columns, which is the row

610
00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:00.040
Sharp 120: number call.

611
01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.260
Sharp 120: which, for

612
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.380
Sharp 120: reasons that make sense that aren't important,

613
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:08.939
Sharp 120: ends up in a string column 1, 2, 3,

614
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.760
Sharp 120: and and then I got an idea.

615
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.700
Sharp 120: The 3 here is like, I'm sure, 4,

616
01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.950
Sharp 120: nothing, nothing but criticism.

617
01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:27.870
Sharp 120:  So I can also read in

618
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:35.780
Sharp 120: my file. And it says, Okay, here's your file. It has 3 columns.

619
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:57.269
Sharp 120: And not only has it has it added a name because it says, Well, surely you have this call. You want to want to refer to it? You wanna do some math with it or something. I'm gonna give it a name. So now I've got

620
01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.160
Sharp 120: bigger.

621
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.900
Sharp 120:  Okay.

622
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:11.510
Sharp 120: so now you you know how to make dayframe. You know how to don't worry if you don't

623
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:14.839
Sharp 120: remember all the the parents for that.

624
01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.810
Sharp 120: By the way, this, it's pretty common in artsy dots in the middle names.

625
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:33.879
Sharp 120: It's just but there's one more simple. This is means something to our and it's the dollar site

626
01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:38.029
Sharp 120: for data frames to access one of your columns. You need to have

627
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:46.219
Sharp 120: give me.

628
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.670
Sharp 120: Yeah.

629
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:50.960
Sharp 120:  I can also.

630
01:01:56.770 --> 01:01:57.730
Sharp 120: for now

631
01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:00.380
Sharp 120: can say

632
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.460
Sharp 120: what that.

633
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:10.960
Sharp 120: Thank you. We need my temple and say names or whatnot.

634
01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:19.319
Sharp 120: Change. One of those names should be

635
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.769
Sharp 120: not, I'm sure

636
01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:28.319
Sharp 120: you know.

637
01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:31.439
Sharp 120: It's actually 6

638
01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:42.670
Sharp 120: because I have a quick scenario.

639
01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:43.600
Sharp 120: What?

640
01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:47.099
Sharp 120: And I've got this this new. Now.

641
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:56.689
Sharp 120: it's different from my original date and support you. I don't mean that the call means a difference in the variable that refers to the

642
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.190
Sharp 120: correct

643
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:09.610
Sharp 120:  I do all the stuff those zoom with vectors, with columns and data frames. You could say, Okay, what's the

644
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.269
Sharp 120: you know, business

645
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.290
Sharp 120: temperature call equals vector 3, 5, 7.

646
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:18.250
Sharp 120: I can ask for third value of column.

647
01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:21.810
Sharp 120: I can ask for the income

648
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.909
Sharp 120: those rows for which yet compass is

649
01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:33.580
Sharp 120: they wouldn't have questions on, why not works?

650
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:38.940
Sharp 120: Okay.

651
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:45.340
Sharp 120: yeah. I should do all that to show you the last thing here which is

652
01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:51.140
Sharp 120: Frank was asking why

653
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:55.450
Sharp 120: To extend this stable.

654
01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:03.209
Sharp 120: and one of the things that we have available to us to to know

655
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:10.800
Sharp 120: what's going on with the from dark side is this thing called the monolo

656
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.980
Sharp 120: from dexter referendum. and so

657
01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.860
Sharp 120: just

658
01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:25.019
Sharp 120: is a

659
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.579
Sharp 120: is a high point near Australia

660
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.560
Sharp 120: and

661
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:35.280
comes back.

662
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.360
Sharp 120: This is the

663
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:42.670
Sharp 120: record. And so, since we'll before 1960, we've had

664
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:49.979
Sharp 120: this record of how Co 2 has been increasing at that 1 point.

665
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.199
Sharp 120: It's not. It's not this really

666
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.730
Sharp 120: words. So

667
01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:05.679
Sharp 120:  has risen from 320 parts per 1 million to 400 parts per 1 million in recent years.

668
01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:10.960
Sharp 120: But that's just the the black light.

669
01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:15.549
Sharp 120: If you look. If you zoom in on this red line back and forth.

670
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.580
Sharp 120: it's a swiggle. a little

671
01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.880
Sharp 120: full, signing sort of

672
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:32.570
Sharp 120: any ideas, why, there's a little sine wave in the mount in the future concentration as measured in.

673
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:33.830
Sharp 120: or what

674
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.510
Sharp 120: that's

675
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:50.779
Sharp 120: to know

676
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.730
doing?

677
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.990
Sharp 120: Very good.

678
01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:04.880
Sharp 120:  so yeah.

679
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.860
Sharp 120: each of these

680
01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:09.009
Sharp 120: little bit

681
01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:13.420
Sharp 120: So it's it's seasonal.

682
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:19.500
Sharp 120: right? It's it's happening every year. And

683
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:26.229
Sharp 120: looks like in the first. So looks like it's it's crossing

684
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:32.870
Sharp 120: the baseline around sort of the year, and then there's there's sort of this increase, and then

685
01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:41.739
Sharp 120: it's falling down in the middle of the year, and then there's that that

686
01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:51.050
Sharp 120: kind of summers where it's it's going through. It's declined.  it's it's recent itself.

687
01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:57.240
Sharp 120:  going back up a little bit.

688
01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:03.350
Sharp 120: So it's usable. Why would

689
01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:11.159
Sharp 120: what? What could possibly be happen? Seasonal need to cause there to be an increase in decrease in 2

690
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:25.929
Sharp 120: towards like the end of the year, I guess. Like.

691
01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:33.090
Sharp 120: yeah. So exactly, this is this is the. This is the explanation. I

692
01:07:33.590 --> 01:08:00.850
Sharp 120: seen the way that that offset here. It's it makes me think that explanation might be something to be desired. I think you're right, that it's it's a little later than we expect for exactly. But that's exactly the explanation that what's going on here is that every year there's plenty of that's happening in summer in the North.

693
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:05.450
Sharp 120: There's more type of Northern hemisphere than there is.

694
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:20.059
Sharp 120: see is maybe like a little increase, and then and then we'll like to low increases.

695
01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:30.600
Sharp 120: 2 little decreases to decrease every time you have plant growth is still kept carbon the whole world. So if there were just as much, you might see 2 little decreases or level.

696
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.009
Sharp 120: but because there's more

697
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:49.700
Sharp 120: specifically boreal forest in the North Hemisphere. You have all Asia you have North America. You end up with. Whenever it's some of the urban house here. The whole world it's in

698
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:56.040
Sharp 120: takes a bunch of carbon dioxide. And then, since it's winter. everything dies releases a bunch of prototypes.

699
01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.020
Sharp 120: So reason II

700
01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.950
Sharp 120: or this in reference to to your question is.

701
01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:14.079
Sharp 120: this is at least one piece of evidence that this that we're really talking about a a global phenomena. This was not measured anywhere near from hemisphere, but it's responding to

702
01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:17.690
Sharp 120: thanks for authentication

703
01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.220
Sharp 120: for so now

704
01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.020
Sharp 120: and go back to.

705
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.950
Sharp 120: So let me let me pop back over here.

706
01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:34.400
Sharp 120: here's our

707
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.499
Sharp 120: monthly enlo.

708
01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:44.700
Sharp 120: No sense, for this is a data set of

709
01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:50.490
Sharp 120: see you, too.  it's Csv file.

710
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.030
Sharp 120: It's great there's also

711
01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.610
Sharp 120: coverage of of interesting columns in here.

712
01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:06.159
Sharp 120: First things.

713
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:16.230
Sharp 120: Co, 2 is going to be the actual measure of Co 2. But then there are bunch of events at least.

714
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:24.490
Sharp 120: there have been periods in the past where they haven't admitted to good at

715
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:31.349
Sharp 120: reporting the Co. 2. And so there's also the call which is going to be

716
01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.159
Sharp 120: taking that out.

717
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:50.860
Sharp 120: So let's do it. Let's use this here. Okay, so here. So it's easy for me.

718
01:10:51.600 --> 01:11:03.369
Sharp 120: so you want to download this file. It's demo profile. and you want to put that in a directory that you know

719
01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:09.050
Sharp 120: how where it is. I'm going to put that into my

720
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.590
Sharp 120: that will start treating

721
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:18.589
Sharp 120: community. And students have done this before. Because I know the past by demonstrating

722
01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:22.190
Sharp 120:  within a bar

723
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:27.640
Sharp 120: at any point in time. You have a personal key structure.

724
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.489
Sharp 120: It's location where

725
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:37.259
Sharp 120: are considers piles to be hopeful, too.

726
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:43.179
Sharp 120: Now, one option is that I could just put the file into this folder.

727
01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:51.170
Sharp 120: my partner folder, and then I'll just be able to read it, which is exactly what I do here, get this, and I just get.

728
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.880
Sharp 120: But

729
01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.129
Sharp 120: sometimes that's not a very convenient spot. Sometimes it will want to worry about what it is.

730
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:07.960
Sharp 120: I can change this. I can say, Okay, I'm going to change this to the download for

731
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:16.229
Sharp 120: First, we have meetings from Demos for it on Max, you can say downloads

732
01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.399
Sharp 120: exactly. on. Pcs

733
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:26.810
Sharp 120: recently have had people tell me that this worked

734
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:28.730
Sharp 120: want to.

735
01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:32.200
Sharp 120: If if it works to do Tilde slash

736
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.739
Sharp 120: just in the devil's part.

737
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:48.330
Sharp 120:  on it. Used to be on Pcs. You'd have to do something like

738
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:59.139
Sharp 120:  users.

739
01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:00.600
Sharp 120: Find me?

740
01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.860
Sharp 120: Pcs.

741
01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:28.130
Sharp 120: what's the what's the right path to get to something to?

742
01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:33.179
Sharp 120: Because, you see.

743
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.440
Sharp 120: Dots, would you say that?

744
01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:40.110
Sharp 120: Let's users.

745
01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:43.110
Sharp 120: yeah.

746
01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.080
that's

747
01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:47.199
Sharp 120: see.

748
01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:56.619
Sharp 120: the working directory

749
01:13:56.690 --> 01:14:03.930
Sharp 120: that are using it. So here I can change 2 devils for And then you PIN that.

750
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:07.219
Sharp 120: say, okay. let me just be able to.

751
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:18.459
Sharp 120: So now, if I just say, yeah, then I'll say no problem. Here's a

752
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:22.850
Sharp 120: 744 row by 10 column.

753
01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:27.710
Sharp 120: and if you do that in our studio. It will

754
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:34.029
Sharp 120: what I usually do when when I'm doing

755
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.130
Sharp 120: Hello! Any

756
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:40.189
Sharp 120: is I'll use the head function.

757
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:47.710
Sharp 120: The head function looks at the top end. Rows of data frame. There's also

758
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:50.390
Sharp 120: a function. So

759
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:51.440
which

760
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:56.160
Sharp 120: it's a few west of the dayframe. I don't know why it's up which.

761
01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:01.740
Sharp 120: fortunately. I guess it thinks that the user is a dog.

762
01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.370
Okay, that's okay.

763
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:05.850
Sharp 120: So kind of.

764
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.440
Sharp 120: you know. and and then we can see, okay.

765
01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:18.360
Sharp 120: they're on the same home side that we're in, you know. and to compliance, and I'm going to plot it is first, just

766
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:22.869
Sharp 120: give me put on the X axis, continue speaking

767
01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:39.760
Sharp 120: because they don't want to deal with the fact that I've got all these a bunch of different values that are all same year. So it'll be at same. I try if I use that, or if we use the month and so just use it to state, and then see 2

768
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.610
Sharp 120: and

769
01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:46.219
Sharp 120: exact same thing that no hits like we're in the government.

770
01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:55.880
Sharp 120: And then this is this is that these are these missing values. You could see it's they're missing. What's not like

771
01:15:55.890 --> 01:16:06.369
Sharp 120: the underlying data? Is there still doing exactly the same thing we're still looking at. and so difference that we do.

772
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:07.620
Yes.

773
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:12.660
Sharp 120: there was actual real life graph. Just the way to

774
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.560
Sharp 120: let's just make sure that

775
01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:22.830
Sharp 120: Axi access labels and

776
01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:28.180
Sharp 120: change the color we could. We could do all that stuff. for all we know.

777
01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:33.990
Sharp 120: Should we do it? Pages of stickers?

778
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.810
Sharp 120: It's not a good use of time, but we do it anyway.

779
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:46.839
Sharp 120:  I'm going to say that my color is red.

780
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:48.560
Sharp 120: I'm gonna save it by

781
01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:53.079
Sharp 120: X label is here. Let's see, my label

782
01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.320
Sharp 120: is Co. 2,

783
01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:00.970
Sharp 120: 2.

784
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:02.850
So

785
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:13.769
Sharp 120: and then I'm just going to add on. Alright, let me see.

786
01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:17.820
Sharp 120: minus same thing

787
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:26.960
Sharp 120: just to

788
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:32.020
Sharp 120: that's going to be joining.

789
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.099
Sharp 120: This is a health seasonal cycle.

790
01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:36.450
Sharp 120: See? Alright.

791
01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.869
Sharp 120: there we are. Good evening. Yeah, that's good. That's not.

792
01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.860
Sharp 120: We're just like going.

793
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.690
Sharp 120: Our has a way of making this a little subscription. But it's a

794
01:17:55.070 --> 01:18:01.960
Sharp 120: the easier way to make that whole subscription is to search for 2 subscription.

795
01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:04.320
Just go.

796
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:19.850
Sharp 120: Okay.

797
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.170
Sharp 120: talk

798
01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.300
Sharp 120: very important.

799
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:26.920
Sharp 120: what tells you everything you need to know?

800
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:34.220
Sharp 120: Okay, any any other, any questions about

801
01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:35.969
Sharp 120: all this stuff?

802
01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.980
Sharp 120: And weren't you guys that

803
01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.430
feature.

804
01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.010
Sharp 120: or any some some subset of you?

805
01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.039
Sharp 120: The the thing that was I was

806
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:57.809
Sharp 120: going to do that there wasn't going to work you as much is ask you to to write it. Some cool equations that are useful in umics.

807
01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.590
Sharp 120: like actually

808
01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:06.330
Sharp 120: forcing, you can plug in the the cycle.

809
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:08.570
Sharp 120: putting

810
01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.350
Sharp 120: brief but

811
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.699
Sharp 120: rate of change of temperature, relative rate of forcing.

812
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:20.470
Sharp 120: and then find out the actual global temperature that comes from the

813
01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:22.190
Sharp 120: perfect.

814
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.379
Sharp 120: We'll do that. We'll do it.

815
01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:31.229
Sharp 120: Okay, great. So let me just

816
01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.350
Sharp 120: back over here.

817
01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.309
Sharp 120: Say a few more things.

818
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.170
Sharp 120: It's only got a few minutes. But

819
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:48.710
Sharp 120: and you respond to at least one of the things that

820
01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:51.899
Sharp 120: that I was another

821
01:19:52.220 --> 01:20:06.639
Sharp 120:  item of not actually confusion, but but pointing out that you do my job that can in the in those little exit tickets, which is, I didn't actually final time machine plus.

822
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:22.539
Sharp 120: So let me give you a a a deficient changes in a few other things. So climate change is changes, changes in climate driven by increases in antigenic greenhouse gases.

823
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:28.080
Sharp 120: So what's I should. I should like

824
01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:38.550
Sharp 120: different slides. That kind of told just usually use 30 year

825
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:40.230
Sharp 120: averages of weather

826
01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:47.880
Sharp 120: as the climate. So you you, for example, say, the climate climactic

827
01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:51.260
Sharp 120: average is is the third year our center.

828
01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:59.709
Sharp 120:  another thing, I another phrase I like is expect weather is what you get.

829
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.859
Sharp 120: But this point out that basically.

830
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:04.930
Sharp 120: when we're talking about private.

831
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:13.599
Sharp 120: we're always talking about something that's related to weather. And actually, time doesn't really exist. It's just snapshot. It's a it's a it's construct that we

832
01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:18.369
Sharp 120: reproduced because what we actually experienced is not quite what we actually experience is feather.

833
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:22.260
Sharp 120:  one of the papers that

834
01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:32.219
Sharp 120: I'll have you guys look at is is metrics. And he lease it out like this.

835
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:38.699
Sharp 120: So let's say that weather is a vector, p, it which has a bunch of things in it

836
01:21:39.650 --> 01:22:00.469
Sharp 120: so, how temperature or humidity these are all going to be location.

837
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:09.010
Sharp 120: whether is specific to this moment in this location and then climate.

838
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:19.250
Sharp 120: one way to to define. It is to say, Okay. whether is some draw from a random distribution.

839
01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:28.150
Sharp 120: from from some, probably distribution here, that probably distribution is called sign, and it's prioritized by some stuff.

840
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.980
Sharp 120: That stuff is another. Vector, see? I tell.

841
01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:34.389
Sharp 120: And so for every time period.

842
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:41.879
Sharp 120: so digital location every time period within a tower. We'll get whether.

843
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:47.950
Sharp 120: according to this distribution, what does that actually mean? Okay, so if town is

844
01:22:48.970 --> 01:22:59.779
Sharp 120: the baseline period, baseline period? Before, let's let's say before 19, before 1,050. So for all years before 1750,

845
01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.670
Sharp 120: you want to know what potential? Well.

846
01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:09.609
Sharp 120: you tell me, for example. the average.

847
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:19.630
Sharp 120: the average central, and also how much variation there is around the average. Those will be 2 different things that are in C, and I will give you the zoom.

848
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:27.439
Sharp 120: Then, if we set how to something else like the end of the century.

849
01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:31.249
Sharp 120: 2080 to 2,100, then

850
01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:40.780
Sharp 120: this would be a different, probably just zoom function and also different parameters. Certainly, that's gonna be higher.

851
01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:47.069
Sharp 120: So deviation might be higher, but also the the might be different.

852
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:54.870
Sharp 120: so that we might need to have additional powers in here. That's fine. With you. Distribution is, or you might redefine sign.

853
01:23:54.980 --> 01:24:19.420
Sharp 120: and some in some sense, whether is always stochastic, it's uncertain. Get something whereas climate is is some sort of generative process that we can separately parameterize and then talk about what it? How those those parameters change. This is, yeah. This is a list of bunch of

854
01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:23.719
Sharp 120: things that might go into this fantastic

855
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:47.859
Sharp 120: vector, range. So day, night range is formality is the difference. It's a measure of annual temperature range relative to the dial range. A bunch of other things.

856
01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:59.699
Sharp 120: These are things that but

857
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:06.150
Sharp 120: not

858
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:11.100
Sharp 120: no problem.

859
01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:15.709
Sharp 120: But you, wanna you wanna give other reactions to

860
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.070
Sharp 120:  or tutorial of of subpoena. So

861
01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:25.350
Sharp 120: feel free to give me this reminder.

862
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:56.520
Sharp 120: Kentucky.

863
01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:06.150
Sharp 120: you don't get to to do an exit ticket. That's okay. People figure out a way to do. Exit tickets for virtual people.

864
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.490
Muhammad Taky Tahmid: okay, thank you so much.
