Basics of Climate Change Science 
Climate Change Economics 

Plan for climate science 
• Today: Basics physics of GHGs 
• Feedback effects and their implications 
• Aspects of uncertainty – Rational belief and long tails – Dimensions of uncertainty – Tipping points?

Some points on climate science 
	•	Theclimateischanging rapidly, and impacts are occurring now.  
	•	IfGHGemissionscontinue, the world will look very different by 2100.  
	•	Addressingclimatechange requires strong mitigation and adaptation action.

Climate science frames the economics and policy of climate change 
• The science poses four unique challenges for climate policy. Climate change is: 
– Global – Long-term – Potentially catastrophic with irreversible impacts – Uncertain

Climate science frames the economics and policy of climate change 
1. Global 
	•	global source: all countries are emitters and carbon dioxide  emissions from one country have the same impacts as from others  
	•	global impacts: CO2 (and other) GHGs are well mixed in the atmosphere so we are all impacted by our own and each others emissions (a global externality).  
	•	global solution: climate change can not be solved unilaterally, it requires global collective action

2. Long-term 
	•	Emissions today will continue to impact the climate for centuries: GHGs stay in the atmosphere for long time periods (decades to millennia) and so have a long-term warming effect. Once in the atmosphere, emissions are effectively irreversible*, committing the world to long-term climatic changes  
	•	Inertia in the climate system means that: - If concentrations of GHGs remained at today’s levels  warming would continue for the next three decades or so.  - Actions taken today to reduce emissions will not have demonstrable effects on warming for a few decades.  - But delaying action will lead to longer commitments. *We can not remove them artificially at  a significant rate (currently)

3. Potentially catastrophic with irreversible impacts 
	•	Climate change will lead to significant changes in our natural environment. These are likely to have substantial societal impacts.  
	•	Some physical changes will be effectively irreversible  
	•	Potential for tipping points and abrupt climate change

4. Uncertain 
	•	We have a good understanding of the drivers of climate change, but  significant uncertainty in the scale of future warming and climate changes expected for a given emissions pathway.  
	•	Uncertainties in future impacts: details of the character and scale of local and regional impacts are particularly uncertain.  
	•	Uncertainty is not well quantified (‘deep uncertainty’), little prospect of significantly reducing prediction uncertainty in the next decade.  
	•	Uncertainties increase as we look further into the future
