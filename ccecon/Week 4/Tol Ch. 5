5.1 Impacts of climate change**
The impacts of climate change are many and diverse.
Changes in temperatw·e, rainfall, cloud cover, wind direction, wind speed, alkalinity, and
so on, would directly affect plants and animals, and those effects would have further impacts
through predation, competition and other ecological interactions. This is true for both managed
and unmanaged ecosystems, as anyone who has ever travelled would have noted: As you travel
south or north, vegetation changes with the climate. Some of these impacts will be positive,
and others negative. Some impacts will be small, and others large.
Climate change affects managed and unmanaged ecosystems. Specialist
and marginalized species will be hit hardest.
The biggest impacts will be seen for marginalized species and specialists. Marginalized
species, by definition, are at the edge of survival. Any change, including climate change, could
either push them over the edge to extinction or dramatically expand their ecological niche.
Specialists, by definition, thrive under very particular conditions. By contrast, generalists
can live most anywhere. Often, specialists do not thrive-but rather survive where others
cannot. If climate would change, their ecological niche could disappear. Although the right

IMPACTS, ADAPTATION AND VALUATION 87
circumstances might well re-appear elsewhere, it is doubtful whether the new and the old niches
are sufficiently connected to allow for migration. This is easily illustrated with Edelweiss, a
pretty little plant that lives where few others can, high up in the Alps. If the world would warm,
Edelweiss would have to move north-but it cannot jump from mountain top to mountain top, it
cannot compete with the plants that live in the valleys, and there are no mountains immediately
north of the Alps. In the wild, Edelweiss is in trouble.
Climate change would not mean that large parts of the planet would turn into a lifeless
moonscape. Rather, nature would become duller, with fewer species covering larger areas.
Figure 5.1 illustrates the scale at which this might occur. Coloured areas denote a wholesale
change in the composition of the ecosystem. The details depend on the model and the climate
scenario, but the scale does not. For large parts of the Earth, future landscapes will be very
different, with savannah where there used to be rainforest and forest where there used to be
tundra.

Agriculture and forestry would also be affected by climate change. Most crops, but weeds
too, would grow faster because of the higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
This is a fertilizer, and allows plants to manage their water more efficiently. Some crops would
benefit from warmer and wetter conditions. Other crops may suffer drier conditions or be less
heat tolerant. The net impact depends on the crop and its location. This is illustrated in Figure
5.2, which shows published estimates of yield changes as a function of climate change for the
three main crops for temperate and tropical regions with and without adaptation. The graphs
show a wide variety of responses, big and small, positive and negative. The only clear message
from Figure 5.2 is that adaptation increases crop yields.1
Global food production will first increase, mainly due to CO2 fertilization, but
decrease later in the century.
One way to cut through the confusing range of impact estimates shown in Figure 5.2, is
to aggregate different crops in different places using a global model of agricultural markets.
Figure 5.3 shows the aggregate impact according to five different models. The indicator is the

engage in self-harm. This is because the illustrious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does not know
how to deal with sample selection bias.

world market price for food. In the next few decades, world food production may well expand
because of climate change, suppressing food prices. In the longer run, however, climate change
is likely to reduce food production, pushing up food prices.

Figure 5.3: The impact of climate change on global food prices
Climate change increases the demand for drinking, cooling and irrigation
water. Both floods and droughts get worse.
Climate change affects water resources, directly through precipitation and evaporation and
indirectly through changes in water use. This would have an impact on agriculture, nature,
drinking water, and inland navigation. It would also affect power generation, which often uses
water as a coolant. Less or hotter water would constrain that, as would regulations on the
temperature of the discharge water.
Energy demand will go down in winter, up in summer. Labour productivity
will decline, unless air-conditioned.
There are further impacts on energy supply. Wind and wind power and cloud cover and
solar power come immediately to mind, but thermal plants are less efficient when it is hot, and
resistance increases with the temperature of transmission cables. Energy use would be affected
too. Demand for cooling energy would increase, and demand for heating energy would fall.
Construction and transport are interrupted by weather events such as cold spells, heat waves,
floods, and fog. Every winter, tourists flock to mountains to ski while beaches are popular in
summer. Climate change would affect the attractiveness of holidays in particular locations.
Sea level rise will cause land loss, wetland loss, floods, saltwater intrusion;
and require costly protection measures.
Sea level rise would have a number of effects. Coastal erosion would increase, and floods
would be more frequent or intense. Saltwater would intrude into groundwater. Many fear that
sea level rise would lead to the disappearance of atoll islands, which often do not reach more
90 CLIMATE ECONOMICS
than a metre above the current high sea level. Saltwater intrusion is likely to make many
of these islands inhabitable decades before they finally disappear beneath the waves. Coastal
wetlands may drown, particularly if coastal defences prevent inland migration.
Adaptation substantially reduces the negative impacts of climate, and may
even change their sign.
Human adaptation is critically important in all impacts of climate change, but perhaps best
illustrated for sea level rise. On a warm summer day, many people lie on the beach, their heads
less than half a metre above the water. Sea level rise would drown them all-unless they adapt. 2
People rarely spend more than a few hours on the beach. When they come back the next day or
the next year, they are not likely to lie down in the exact same spot. When their grandchildren
visit the beach by the time sea level has risen by half a metre, they will not insist on sunbathing
in the same location as gTanny used to do-particularly not when that spot is now under water.
While this example seems ridiculous, many impact studies continue to assume that people do
not adapt to climate change. This is sometimes referred to as the Dumb Farmer Hypothesis,
assuming that farmers will plant and harvest the same crops at the same time as their fathers
and grandfathers did, and apply the same pesticides and fertilizers. In fairness to the people
who grow our food, this really is the Dumb Analyst Hypothesis3-farmers are a lot smarter
than that.
Flood defences were known to the Sumerians and Ancient Chinese. As sea level rises, people
will not sit on their hands while their buildings, roads and land are swept away. Dykes would
be raised, groins built, beaches nourished, saltwater desalinated. In many places, the cost
of adaptation would be the main impact of climate change, and residual impacts would be
relatively small.
Climate change would also affect labour productivity. The human body is in a thermal
equilibrium with its environment. As any warm-blooded animal, we need to keep our body at
a particular temperature. Shivering to keep warm and sweating to keep cool cost energy. Work
raises our body temperature. Sweating is less effective in humid conditions. So the human
body is less able to do work when it is hot and humid. The productivity of outdoor, physical
labour would fall if the climate warms, as would indoor work unless air-conditioned.
Cold-related deaths will go down, heat-related ones up. Infectious diseases,
like malaria and diarrhoea, will increase.
Through the same process, heatwaves affect human health. Healthy people tire when it is
hot. The bodies of the very young, the very old, and people with cardiovascular or respiratory
disorder may give up altogether. Cold kills too. Like heat, cold creates physiological stress.
More importantly, during cold weather, people gToup together indoors, giving free reign to
infectious diseases. Climate change would further affect human health through nutrition (see
the discussion on agriculture above), through air pollution, and through vector-borne diseases
such as diarrhoea, malaria and cholera.
5.2 The government's role in adaptation**
Is climate cha.nge a public good that merits government intervention?
2This is the Gruenspecht Rule of Adaptation, after Howard Gruenspecht.
3The Dumb Analyst Syndrome was coined by Colin Prentice.

IMPACTS, ADAPTATION AND VALUATION 91
The impacts of climate change are many and diverse. As adaptation is about altering those
impacts, adaptation is diverse too. Instead of talking about generalities, a few examples are
discussed below.
Climate change will make heatwaves more common. During hot weather, you should wear
light clothes, not exert yourself, keep out of the sun, and drink lots (but little alcohol). This is
adaptation, but private. People know this, and have the appropriate incentives to take these
measures. There is no need for a government plan that will tell you not to put on your winter
coat when it is hot outside. Parents should tell young children, though, and old people may
need help.
Most adaptation is private, e.g., clothing during a heatwave. Some adaptation
is collective, e.g., siestas.
There are collective elements to this. It makes sense to have a siesta during the hottest
hours of the day, and to have the main meal late in the evening. These things are more easily
arranged when everyone in the neighbourhood does the same. There is no need, though, for
the government to tell you when you should eat your dinner.
The government may run awareness campaigns to help unsuspecting populations cope with
extreme heat (although such campaigns are not always effective), but there is no need for
government intervention.
Some adaptation requires regulation, e.g., allowing people into air-conditioned
shopping malls during heatwaves.
There are public elements, however. Over 40,000 people died during the 2003 heatwave in
France. Many medical professionals were on holiday then. There was no procedure to call them
back. The people who could overrule procedure were on holiday too, and apparently did not
follow the news back home. Shopping malls are air-conditioned, but during earlier heatwaves
in the USA, security personnel removed people who came to seek relief from the heat rather
than shop. In crime-infested neighbourhoods, people were afraid to open their windows, but
there was no extra police on the street. ote that violent and sexual crime is more common
during hot weather, so you would want to increase police presence anyway. Poor people could
not afford the electricity to power theirs fans, but electricity bills were not waived during the
heatwave. Clearly, the government has a role to play, as a facilitator of private adaptation, as
a regulator, and as a service provider.
Some adaptation involves the public sector, e.g., health care during heatwaves,
or agricultural extension services.
Agriculture is our second example. Climate change would affect crop yields. Farmers could
respond in a number of ways. Planting and harvest dates could be changed, as could the
application of pesticide, fertilizer and irrigation. Different varieties or different crops could be
planted, or farmers could seek alternative livelihoods. Seed companies and extension services
could support farmers with advice. It is in the farmer's own interest to adapt as the alternative
is a drop in income.
The public sector may hinder adaptation, e.g., agricultural subsidies that
lock farmers into past behaviour.
As with health and heat, the role of the government is limited. Extension services are often
state-owned and -run (even though no public good is provided) and so is large-scale irrigation.
92 CLIMATE ECONOMICS
In other ways, the government hinders adaptation. Import tariffs distort international trade
and discourage specialization in what is comparatively advantageous. Subsidies similarly distort
the market, rewarding particular activities at the expense of others and shielding farmers from
market signals. In the European Union, subsidies are particularly generous in disadvantaged
areas. That is, farmers are encouraged to grow the wrong thing in the wrong place. Here,
withdrawal is the best the government can do for adaptation.
Little adaptation is public. Coastal protection and shared water resources
are exceptions to the rule.
Sea level rise is the third example. There are private elements to adaptation. Tourists do not
need to be told that they should not go sunbathing on a beach that has been eroded by sea level
rise. Otherwise, coastal protection is a public good. Protection of a lot would be ineffective or
exceedingly expensive unless it is coordinated with the projection of adjacent lots. Lots further
inland benefit from the protection of the sea front, and should therefore contribute to the cost
of coastal protection. Information asymmetries justify building codes (to help protect against
wind and water) and land zoning. The government should take the lead in adaptation.
5.3 How to adapt**
Most systems change much faster than the climate, and adaptation will be
one of many changes.
A number of examples of how to adapt to climate change are given above. In most cases,
adaptation to climate change is like adaptation to any change. In many systems, climate changes
more slowly than other drivers, so adaptation to climate change would not post any particular
challenge-recall the example of sunbathers on the beach and the risk of sea level rise.
There are two exceptions. Long-lived investments will have to withstand a wider range of
weather. Future precipitation is particularly uncertain, with models disagreeing about the sign
of change in many parts of the world. Investment in long-lived water infrastructure thus has to
be prepared for a future in which anything can happen.
Uncertainty is a major issue for long-lived water infrastructure. Adaptation
demands more robustness and flexibility.
There are two ways of doing so: Make the investment more robust, or make the investment
more flexible. Extra robustness entails that infrastructure can function under a wider range
of weather conditions. This is relatively straightforward (but costly) if the sign of change is
known. Sea walls, for instance, should be raised higher. The sign of future sea level rise is
known, but the extent is uncertain. It would make sense to prepare for a high rate of sea level
rise and raise the sea wall by more than is probably needed. This is because there is a large
fixed cost in sea wall reinforcement (e.g., planning permission, project management, transport
disruption) but a relative low variable cost (e.g., materials, labour).
Extra flexibility may be more appropriate if the sign of change is unknown. Extra flexibility
entails that infrastructure can be scaled up or down as needed. This comes at a cost too, as
both design and materials are more advanced. For instance, a number of small reservoirs are
more flexible than one big one, as the total storage capacity can be increased or decreased by
commissioning or decommissioning one of the reservoirs. Moveable dams and inflatable barriers
can be used to stop water only when needed. Retention areas can be used to temporarily store
extra water. Infrastructure designed with such features command a premium in the face of an
uncertain future.

IMPACTS, ADAPTATION AND VALUATION 93
5.4 Purpose of valuation*
Monetary valuation seeks to estimate the value of environmental goods or services that are not
traded on markets. Market goods and services are routinely valued and property is frequently
valued too, typically in preparation for a sale. The purpose of environmental valuation is
different.
The impacts of climate change are many and diverse. A superindicator is
needed to assess its seriousness.
There are many impacts of climate change, some positive, some negative, some big, some
small. Impacts vary over space and over time. The question whether or not climate change
is a problem, and whether it is a big problem or small problem cannot be answered without
aggregating the impacts. Monetary valuation serves this purpose. It puts all impacts in a
common metric, money in this case, which is a prerequisite for aggregation.
Expressing the total and marginal impact of climate change in monetary terms is handy
because it allows for an immediate comparison with the impacts of greenhouse gas emission
reduction. It also allows for a comparison with other issues, and to the Gross Domestic Product.
Furthermore, if the victims of climate change are to be compensated, it will likely be in the
form of money.
Money was invented to compare and add the value of diverse goods and
services, and indeed income.
Some people object to environmental valuation, or find it hard to understand how putting a
price tag on something valuable is feasible or meaningful. Yet, money was invented exactly for
this purpose. In a barter economy with N goods, there are 0.5 * N * (N -1) prices. In a money
economy, there are only N prices. That is probably why money was invented: 4 To reduce the
transaction and information costs of trade. And through the medium of money, some strange
trade-offs are made. Working within a tight budget, students have to choose between a new
pair of jeans, a night out, or a textbook. Professors can afford all those things, but have to
make a choice between a boat, an extension to the house, or sending the kids to Harvard. Those
things are incomparable at first glance, yet choices are made every day. Presumably, people
can compare such things. Some things may be worth the money they cost, and other things
not.
Monetary valuation of environmental goods and services is done for the purpose of improving
decisions and making choices that a.re consistent with other choices we make. We would
maximize environmental quality if that were costless. It is not. Sacrifices need to be made to
reduce emissions. Some of these sacrifices are worth it, and others are not. Monetary valuation
informs that decision.
5.5 Valuation methods: Revealed preferences*
Behaviour in related markets (housing, recreation, labour) can be used to
estimate the money value of environmental goods.
There are a number of methods, and many variants, to value environmental goods and
services. The more reliable but narrower ones use the actual behaviour of people and households.
4 Besides the unit of accounting, money is also the means of exchange and a store of value.
94 CLIMATE ECONOMICS
The travel cost method is the oldest method, and perhaps the most intuitive one. It belongs to
the broader class of household production methods.
Consider your local park. If you would ask its visitors where they are from, you would learn
that most of them come from the neighbourhood. Many live a block away and are in the park
with their dogs or children. Some cycled or drove 10-15 minutes. Few have travelled across the
country, and none across the world to be in your local park. That makes perfect sense. Your
park is nice, but nothing special. There are many similar parks elsewhere. Why would anyone
travel just to visit your park?
Now consider the Great Barrier Reef. There are many visitors. There are locals, of course,
but relatively few. People fly all the way across the world to visit the Great Barrier Reef. Why?
Because it is unique and spectacular!
The food that you buy is worth at least as much to you as the money you spent on that
food. The movie that you see in the cinema is worth at least as much as the ticket you need
to get in, at least in expectation. You do not pay an entrance fee to get into your local park.
However, you do spend time to get there, and you may spend money on a bus fare or something
similar.
If you extend your visitor survey and ask people how long they needed to get to the park and
how much money they spent getting there, you would find that many paid little, few paid more,
and none paid a whole lot. You would find something that looks remarkably like a demand
curve: Low price, high demand; high price, low demand. In fact, you have found a demand
curve. If you integrnte under the curve, you estimate the consumer surplus generated by your
local park. If you then repeat the exercise for the Great Barrier Reef, you find that demand is
still high at a high price-and its value is much greater than the value of your local park.
Although conceptually clear, the travel cost method is beset with practical difficulties.
Travel time is valuable, but how valuable exactly? In a perfect labour market, the wage equals
the marginal value of leisure-but labour markets are distorted in many ways. Trips often
serve multiple purposes (e.g., going to the park and the shop; visiting Sydney and the Great
Barrier Reef) and that means that the travel cost needs to be apportioned to these purposes.
Sometimes the trip is a cost (e.g., travelling alone in a hot and crowded train), and sometimes
the trip is part of fun (e.g., travelling in an open top car with friends). These problems can be
overcome with a sufficiently detailed survey, plenty of data, and clever econometrics.
The second class of revealed preference methods analyzes household consumption. Hedonic
pricing is the best known example. A house that sits in a beautiful environment is worth more
than the exact same house that sits in an ugly environment. The price difference is an indication
of the value of environmental beauty.
Like the travel cost method, hedonic pricing is conceptually straightforward but difficult in
practice. Builders are not stupid. They put the prettiest houses in the prettiest environments,
and more ordinary houses elsewhere. Expensive houses attract more well-to-do home owners,
who tend to be better educated and socially more attractive as neighbours. Such neighbourhoods
tend to have better schools and other facilities. At the larger scale, wages compensate
both for the local cost of living and for the attractiveness of the environment, and house prices
in turn reflect wages. In sum, the housing market is influenced by many things, and you need
a large amount of observations and clever econometric methods to isolate the effect of the environment-
but it can be done.
Defensive expenditure is a third class of revealed preference methods. You prefer clear air
and clean water, but if it is not available you get an air filter or mask, you buy a water purifier
or switch to bottled water. You prefer safe roads, but get a bike helmet because they are not.
You pay extra for healthy food, or install double-glazed windows to keep the noise out. All
these expenditures compensate for the lack of something in the environment that you like.

IMPACTS, ADAPTATION AND VALUATION 95
As above, defensive expenditure is conceptually easy but difficult in practice. Did you
get double-glazed windows to keep the noise out or to save energy? Do you drink bottled
water because other water is polluted or because you like its taste? Bottled water comes in a
limited price range; the most expensive bottle in the shop may be well below your willingness
to pay. There is another problem. A cursory glance at the media will tell you that experts
often disagree about what food and drink is healthy and unhealthy. People do not purchase an
objective reduction in the chance of premature death when switching to organic food. Even if the
experts could agree on that change in probability, what matters is the subjective assessment
of the buyer or others in the household. An empirical study would need data not only on
purchases (which are easy to get if you find a cooperative retailer) but also on what good the
purchasers think these things do. This introduces all sorts of potential biases. As one example,
most people are not very good at probability calculus and they get progressively worse when
handling very small probabilities.
5.6 Valuation methods: Stated preferences*
Revealed preference methods only reveal the direct consumption value of
the environment.
Revealed preference methods have the advantage that actual decisions are analyzed. The
disadvantage is that it considers only those values that are expressed, indirectly, in market
transactions.
I care about whales. Nothing in my behaviour of the last 20 years has revealed that I do. I
do not contribute to Greenpeace, the major NGO that campaigns for the preservation of whales,
because I do not agree with their energy and climate policies. I do not go whale watching. I
did that once. The whales did not show up. I will not do it again. You could have followed
me around for 20 years, checked all my bank statements, and you would not have learned that
I care about whales. Yet, I do. To find out, you need to attend my class or read my book. Or
you could ask me.
Stated preference methods do exactly that. The contingent valuation method is the oldest
and most widely used. It uses surveys (face-to-face, by phone, by mail, over the Internet) that
include questions such as "how much would you be willing to contribute to help preserve the
population of grey-blue humpback whales in the orth Atlantic?" Researchers have now moved
away from open-ended questions (as above) to single-bounded-"would you be willing to pay
more than £50 per year"-or double-bounded-"would you be willing to pay between £50 and
£75 per year"-questions plus randomization of interviewees. Dichotomous choice is another
option. Would you pay £50? If not, would you pay £25? If so, would you pay £75?
More recently, contingent choice methods have become popular. Here, interviewees are
asked to choose between sets of attributes-"would you rather contribute £50/year and have a
population of 8,000 humpback whales or contribute £75/year and have a population of 10,000
humpback whales?" Contingent choice has gained acceptance because it resembles other purchase
decisions more closely-think of the shelves with cornflakes in the supermarket-and
because it reveals more about the environmental characteristics that interviewees care about.
Stated preference methods can reveal any value, but people do not necessarily
speak the truth.
The main advantage of stated preference methods is that you can value anything: consumption
of environmental services (as in revealed preferences), option values (I am not using it
96 CLIMATE ECONOMICS
now but I may want to use it later), bequest values (I do not care much but I would like my
children to enjoy it), and existence values (I am happier because I know that there are whales
out there).
The main disadvantage of stated preference methods is that interviewees do not put their
money where their mouth is. Interviewees may therefore take less care in expressing their
preferences, or they may try and mislead the interviewer.
Interviewees may be influenced by the interviewer; they may be repelled (and thus give a
low value or none at all) or may try to impress (and thus give a high value). Interviewees
may realize that they are not being asked to contribute, but rather that they are asked about
spending government money, and that their answer will be averaged with other interviewees.
Interviewees may care about the environmental service in question, but object to the suggested
way of delivery (e.g., higher taxes for environmental protection).
Standard micro-economic theory assumes that people are rational and fully informed. In
fact, experience is a better description. If people make routine decisions in a familiar environment-
for example, the weekly trip to the supermarket-they buy the stuff that they want, and
pay a reasonable price for an acceptable quality. If you let people make the same decisions in
an unfamiliar environment-a foreign supermarket, say, in a country with a different language,
other eating habits, and an unfamiliar currency-errors creep in. For decisions that are not
routine-buying insurance or a car, say-people gather information by searching the Internet
and talking to friends and family before making a choice.
Contingent valuation and contingent choice methods put interviewees in a situation that
is unfamiliar and asks them to make a decision that is not routine. The results are therefore
noisy.
Stated preference methods are now implemented with a standard battery of tests that check
and correct for the many biases that may creep into the results. Although these methods are
applied routinely in public policy making and litigation, it is a very active research field and
results are less reliable than we would like them to be.
5. 7 Issues for climate change**
There are two problems with valuation methods that are particularly relevant for the impact
of climate change.
5. 7 .1 Benefit transfer
Measured values are multifaceted, difficult to generalize and thus hard to
extrapolate to future climate change.
Primm·y valuation is expensive. As suggested above, conceptually straightforward ideas are
difficult to put into practice. An applied revealed preference study easily employs someone for
a full year. Stated preference studies are considerably more time-consuming. Therefore, there
are only a limited number of primary estimates. Because the methods are under continuous
development, researchers often go back and re-value a good or service that was previously
studied so that they can show that their new method makes a change.
Case studies are great for science and replication is better, but in order to inform public
policy we need a comprehensive coverage of all goods and services affected in every location.
Extrapolation is required. This is known as benefit transfer.
Two techniques are used to extrapolate primary estimates from one location to another, from
one issue to another, and from one time to another. First, estimates are transferred without

IMPACTS, ADAPTATION AND VALUATION 97
further ado. Second, existing estimates are subject to a meta-analysis, a set of statistical
techniques to discover empirical regularities in previously published results. This may reveal,
for instance, that richer people are willing to pay more for environmental protection; an income
elasticity is estimated. Then, the estimated relationships are used to extrapolate from the
observed sites to all sites of interest. This is known as benefit transfer by transfer function.
This is a reasonable approach. Unfortunately, meta-analytic regressions have low explanatory
power, and tests of the validity of benefit transfer show large errors. The reason is twofold.
The data are noisy, and values are highly context specific. Idiosyncrasy cannot be predicted.
This matters for climate change because the relevant impacts occur in the future, which
cannot be observed. Furthermore, there have been few primary studies to value the impacts of
climate change, so benefits are transferred from other issues, such as occupational health, air
pollution, and eutrophication. Finally, valuation studies have disproportionally focused on rich
countries, but the impacts of climate change are concentrated in poor countries. Valuation of
the impacts of climate change is thus a particularly uncertain business.
5. 7.2 WTP versus WTAC**
The other problem with valuation that is especially important for climate change is as follows.
Above, I conceptualize the question as the willingness to pay (WTP) to acquire an environmental
good or improve an environmental service. You may also conceptualize the question as
the willingness to accept compensation (WTAC) for a deterioration of environmental quality.
Willingness to accept compensation is (much) larger than willingness to pay
because of loss aversion and imposed risk.
Consider the following example. Someone knocks on your door, tells about the plans to
convert the parking lot down the road into a park, and asks you for a financial contribution.
ow contrast this to the situation where someone knocks on your door, tells about the plans
to convert the park down the road into a parking lot, and offers you financial compensation.
Objectively, the comparison is the same: tarmac and cars versus trees and grass. There
are differences, though. In one case, you are asked to contribute and are therefore constrained
by your budget. In the other case, you are offered money and are therefore constrained by
your perception of the other party's budget. Under standard micro-economic assumptions, the
budget constraint makes a small difference. The difference between WTP and WTAC can be
large, however, if income is a poor substitute for the good being valued.
There is another difference: You may be emotionally attached to the existing park because
of the happy memories you have of the place. You may have often walked your dog there, or got
your first kiss. You cannot be emotionally attached to a hypothetical pa.rk that was introduced
to you a few minutes before. The amount you would be willing to accept as compensation for
the loss of a park is thus greater than the amount you would be willing to pay to acquire a
park.
Empirical studies indeed show this. See Figure 5.4. The willingness to accept compensation
for the loss of a good or service is larger, often a lot larger, than the willingness to pay for
the same good or service. Four explanations have been offered. The budget constraint and
emotional attachment are two.
Studies have shown that people are loss averse. They attach a value to the status quo.
Losing something is worse than gaining the same thing is good. Loss aversion has been shown
to occur even for routine, low-worth goods (e.g., coffee mugs) that were acquired less than
an hour ago. If you give students a mug and try to buy it back from them, they demand a
price that is much higher than they would pay for the same mug in the shop next door. It is

easy to describe such behaviour as irrational. It creates a dilemma for public policy. Do you
educate people to be more rational, ignore this aspect of people's preference, or seek to reflect
the strange will of the people in the government's decisions?
The fourth explanation of the difference between willingness to accept compensation and
willingness to pay is that voluntary risks are viewed differently than involuntary risks. Suppose
that you get drunk, go joy-riding, get into an accident, and lose a leg. That would feel bad.
I ow suppose I get drunk, go joy-riding, get you into an accident, and you lose a leg. That would
feel worse-even though there is no objective difference: Your leg is gone. Context matters for
valuation because people are social animals.
Do we buy a better climate for our grandchildren or do we compensate
them for imposing a worse climate?
This matters for climate change. Do we formulate climate policy as us buying a better
climate for our children, or do we conceptualize the problem as us imposing a worse climate
on our children and offering them compensation in return? Do we formulate climate policy
as rich people buying a better climate for their richer children? Or as rich people imposing a
worse climate on the children of the poor? Do we view carbon dioxide emissions as necessary
for survival? Or as an indulgence of a luxurious life style? The value of climate change impacts
would be different, depending on how the question is framed.

Exercises
5.1 Climate change would change landscapes as vegetation responds. How could you estimate
the value of changes in the landscape?
5.2 Climate change would affect human health through changes in weather extremes and
vector ecology. How could you estimate the value of changes in risk to human mortality
and morbidity?
5.3 Climate change would affect species abundance and may lead to local and even global
extinctions. How could you estimate the value of changes in biodiversity?
5.4 Estimates of the value of the impact of future climate change are necessarily based on
data from the present and past. How could you estimate future values?
5.5 Would the valuation of the impact of climate change be different if we phrase the policy
question as "buying a better climate for our grandchildren" or as "compensating our
grandchildren for climate change"?
5.6 Section 4.10 discusses the Coase Theorem and its application to the initial allocation
of emission permits. Does the Coase Theorem need to be reconsidered in the light of
the discussion on the difference between willingness to pay and willingness to accept
compensation?
