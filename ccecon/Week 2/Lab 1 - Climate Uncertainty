\section*{Programming problems}

In this lab, we will explore what global climate projections have to
say about the future of the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

Global climate projections are generated using Gridded Climate Models
(GCMs), which provide data at low spatial resolution (typically
coarser than 1$^\circ$ in latitude and longitude). For this data to be
usable for most socioeconomic work, it needs to go through processes
called ``downscaling'' and ``bias correction''.

In this lab, we will use a dataset of results that have already gone
through this process, producing locally plausible data at a 10-minute
resolution, from WorldClim
(\url{https://www.worldclim.org/}).% \footnote{The current website for
% WorldClim is a mess, so we will include any necessary details here. If
% you want to learn more about the method, look Hijmans, R.J.,
% S.E. Cameron, J.L. Parra, P.G. Jones and A. Jarvis, 2005. Very high
% resolution interpolated climate surfaces for global land
% areas. International Journal of Climatology 25:
% 1965-1978. \url{https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/joc.1276}.}

WorldClim also extracts a collection of broadly useful metrics to
summarize climate, called bioclimatic variables. We will be using
these variables which are represented as numbered layers in the
files. Here is the list:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
BIO1 & Annual Mean Temperature \\
BIO2 & Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp)) \\
BIO3 & Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (* 100) \\
BIO4 & Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100) \\
BIO5 & Max Temperature of Warmest Month \\
BIO6 & Min Temperature of Coldest Month \\
BIO7 & Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6) \\
BIO8 & Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter \\
BIO9 & Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter \\
BIO10 & Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter \\
BIO11 & Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter \\
BIO12 & Annual Precipitation \\
BIO13 & Precipitation of Wettest Month \\
BIO14 & Precipitation of Driest Month \\
BIO15 & Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) \\
BIO16 & Precipitation of Wettest Quarter \\
BIO17 & Precipitation of Driest Quarter \\
BIO18 & Precipitation of Warmest Quarter \\
BIO19 & Precipitation of Coldest Quarter \\
\end{tabular}

Everyone answer questions 1 - 6. {\bf MAST 488} and {\bf MAST 688}
students get different sections for questions 7 - 8 below.

\section{Get the data}

First, download all of the data for this lab. I have already extracted
the mid-Atlantic region from the downscaled results and stored them
here:
\url{https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/cp06rtfx53w5kstr48043/h?rlkey=f4tnngodqpzy7bgx7jxbddrpc}

These files describe future projections of the bioclimatic
variables. The data is stored in NetCDF files (\verb+.nc+), which is a
file format that stores matrices or arrays with any number of
dimensions. A single file can include multiple arrays, and climate
data is often stored as one 3-D array, with dimensions for time,
latitude, and longitude, and the actual latitude and longitude
coordinates are stored as separate 1-D arrays.

The \verb+mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc+ describes the historical weather
conditions, from 1970 - 2000. The other files are all future
projections, using different GCMs and different emissions
scenarios. The format of these filenames is
\verb+mab_bioc_[GCM]_[SSP]_[Years].nc+, where \verb+[GCM]+ is one of
nine GCMs, \verb+[SSP]+ is either SSP1-2.6 or SSP3-7.0, and
\verb+[Years]+ is the span of future years described.

\subsection{Looking at historical average temperatures}

We will be using R, and you will need the \verb+raster+, \verb+ncdf4+,
and \verb+ggplot2+ packages. If you do not already have these, install
them with \verb+install.packages(c("raster", "ncdf4", "ggplot2"))+.

Then run the following code to load data from the historical file:

\begin{lstlisting}
library(raster)
rr = raster("[path-to-data]/mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc", band=1)
rr
\end{lstlisting}

%% setwd("~/Dropbox/Climate Change Economics 2024/labs/lab1 - climate uncertainty")
%% rr = raster("data/mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc", band=1)

The last line will print out some basic information about the
file. \verb+band:+ tells you which bioclimatic variable you are
viewing: this is BIO1, Annual Mean Temperature.

{\bf 1. The \verb+extent:+ line describes the longitude and latitude
  range in the data. Find or generate a map online which includes the
  same spatial extent (and showing anything you think interesting:
  physical geography, land use, cities and roads), and clip the map to
  this approximate extent. Include this in your submission file.}

The {\tt dimensions} entry in that information tells you the number of
rows, the number of columns, and the total number of cells (rows x
columns) in the matrix that holds the data.

{\bf 2a. How are the three numbers on the \verb+dimensions:+ line
  related to the \verb+resolution:+ and \verb+extent:+ lines? Write an
  equation that calculates the reported number of rows, and an
  equation to calculate the number of columns, from the
  \verb+resolution:+ and \verb+extent:+ values.  2b. The data is a
  grid of cells. What is the latitude and longitude of the {\it
    center} of the grid cell in the north-west corner? This will not
  be exactly equal to any of the reported numbers.}

The next code graphs the annual mean temperature, in Celsius, by first
converting the matrix into a long data frame, and then giving the data
to \verb+ggplot+ to plot it.

\begin{lstlisting}
library(ggplot2)
df = as.data.frame(rr, xy=T)
head(df) # this is to see what the resulting data frame looks like
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=variable)) + geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_gradient("Temperature (C)", low="yellow", high="red") + coord_fixed(expand=F)
\end{lstlisting}

{\bf 3. Make a similar graph for annual total precipitation. The
  WorldClim data for annual precipitation is reported in mm.  When
  plotting this, have the gradient go from white to blue, rather than
  yellow to red. Include both plots in your submission.}

% rr = raster("data/mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc", band=12)
% df = as.data.frame(rr, xy=T)
% ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=variable)) + geom_raster() + scale_fill_gradient("Annual Precipitation (mm)", low="white", high="blue") + coord_fixed(expand=F)

{\bf 4. Identify three broad features of the climate data, as bullet
  point descriptions. For example, you might say, ``$\bullet$ Average
  temperature increases from north to south.'' Relate these features
  to your map from question 1, when possible. }

\subsection{Expected future changes}

It is common practice to use multiple GCMs when trying to understand
how climate will change. We will do this by averaging over the nine
GCMs provided by WorldClim.

The following code loads in all of the annual temperature data and
shows the change in the annual temperature by the end of the century
under SSP3-7.0 (a high-emissions scenario).

\iffalse
## First, let's just load in the BIO1 data again
rr = raster("data/mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc", band=1)
df = as.data.frame(rr, xy=T)

## Now we will load in all future data
future = matrix(NA, nrow(df), 0)
for (filename in list.files("data", ".+_ssp370_2081-2100.nc")) {
    rr2 = raster(file.path("data", filename), band=1)
    future = cbind(future, as.data.frame(rr2))
}

## And add the difference as a column
df$ssp370.mean = rowMeans(future - df$variable)

## And plot it
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=ssp370.mean)) + geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_gradient("Temperature\nchange (C)", low="yellow", high="red") + coord_fixed(expand=F)

rr = raster("data/mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc", band=12)
df = as.data.frame(rr, xy=T)

## Now we will load in all future data
future = matrix(NA, nrow(df), 0)
for (filename in list.files("data", ".+_ssp370_2081-2100.nc")) {
    rr2 = raster(file.path("data", filename), band=12)
    future = cbind(future, as.data.frame(rr2))
}

## And add the difference as a column
df$ssp370.mean = rowMeans(future - df$variable)

## And plot it
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=ssp370.mean)) + geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_gradient("Annual Precipitation\nchange (mm)", low="white", high="blue") + coord_fixed(expand=F)
\fi

\begin{lstlisting}
## First, let's just load in the BIO1 data again
rr = raster("[path-to-data]/mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc", band=1)
df = as.data.frame(rr, xy=T)

## Now we will load in all future data
future = matrix(NA, nrow(df), 0)
for (filename in list.files("[path-to-data]", ".+_ssp370_2081-2100.nc")) {
    rr2 = raster(file.path("[path-to-data]", filename), band=1)
    future = cbind(future, as.data.frame(rr2))
}

## And add the difference as a column
df$ssp370.mean = rowMeans(future - df$variable)

## And plot it
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=ssp370.mean)) + geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_gradient("Temperature (C)", low="yellow", high="red") + coord_fixed(expand=F)
\end{lstlisting}

{\bf 5. Make a similar graph for the end of century change in annual
total precipitation. Include both plots in your submission.}

{\bf 6. Identify three broad features of these changes, as bullet
point descriptions.}

\subsection{Uncertainty in changes}

Finally, we want to understand how much disagreement there is across
the models. A mean value can be misleading if, for example, the GCMs
cannot even agree on the sign of the change. This is the case for
changes in rainfall in many areas.

While the code in the previous section calculated a mean across the
GCM-specific projected changes, we want to calculate a measure of GCM
disagreement. The proposed measure of disagreement (for MAST 488 path
students) is the standard deviation across GCM-specific changes,
divided by the standard deviation over historical values across the
region. This will be large if the models cannot agree, and the
denominator here acts to normalize the changes, so we can understand
how important a difference is.

{\bf MAST 488 path students:}

Modify the previous code above that calculates mean changes by
replacing \lstinline{df$ssp370.mean = rowMeans(future - df$variable)}
with the line \lstinline{df$ssp370.diff = apply(future - df$variable, 1, sd) / sd(df$variable, na.rm=T)}. % $

Apply the code above to each of the 19 bioclimatic variables. For each
bioclimatic variable, calculate the mean disagreement over all pixels
using
\lstinline{print(mean(df$ssp370.diff, na.rm=T))}. You may want to use %$
a loop to do this, but you can also just run the code 19 times with
different band numbers.

{\bf 7. Which bioclimatic variable has the most uncertainty, according
  to this metric?}

{\bf 8. Look at the maps for the historical values of this bioclimatic
  variable, it's expected future change, and it's level of agreement on
  that change. Include each of these (properly labeled) in your
  submission. Why is there so much disagreement here?}

\iffalse

\begin{lstlisting}
for (bio in 1:19) {
    ## First, load in the baseline data
    rr = raster("data/mab_bioc_GHCN_1970-2000.nc", band=bio)
    df = as.data.frame(rr, xy=T)

    ## Now we will load in all future data
    future = matrix(NA, nrow(df), 0)
    for (filename in list.files("data", ".+_ssp370_2081-2100.nc")) {
        rr2 = raster(file.path("data", filename), band=bio)
        future = cbind(future, as.data.frame(rr2))
    }

    ## And add it on as a column
    df$ssp370.mean = rowMeans(future - df$variable)
    df$ssp370.diff = apply(future - df$variable, 1, sd) / sd(df$variable, na.rm=T)
    print(c(bio, mean(df$ssp370.diff, na.rm=T)))
}

## bio = 8
## Run code in loop above

ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=variable)) + geom_raster() +
    scale_fill_gradient("Baseline wet season\ntemperature (C)", low="yellow", high="red") + coord_fixed(expand=F)
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=ssp370.mean)) + geom_raster() +
    scale_fill_gradient("Change in wet season\ntemperature (C)", low="yellow", high="red") + coord_fixed(expand=F)
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, fill=ssp370.diff)) + geom_raster() +
    scale_fill_gradient("Disagreement over wet season\ntemperature (score)", low="yellow", high="red") + coord_fixed(expand=F)

\end{lstlisting}

\fi

{\bf MAST 688 path students:}

Come up with {\bf two} different measures of disagreement between the
GCMs. Your measure of disagreement should be calculated a the
grid-cell level, and be applicable to some or all of the bioclimatic
variables.

{\bf 7. Write the equation for each of your measures and explain the
  motivation for how it calculates disagreement. How or when is it
  preferable to the ratio of standard deviations described above?}

{\bf 8. Implement each measure in the code, by replacing the
  \verb+df$ssp370.mean+ line as described in the {\bf MAST 488 path}
  section. Produce plots of disagreement across space for your two
  measures, for one of the bioclimatic variables. Explain why they
  produce different spatial results.}
