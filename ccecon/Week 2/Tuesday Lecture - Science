Climate change: Changes in climate driven by increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
Climate: 
The 30-year average of weather?
Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get?
Weather:

Climate: 
_𝒗_𝑖𝑡_~ 𝜓__𝑪_𝑖𝜏__ ∀ 𝑡∈𝜏
Where 𝜓 is a multivariate probability distribution, _𝑪_𝑖𝜏_ is some parameters (e.g., see right)

Defining some terms
Climate change: Changes in climate driven by increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
Anthropogenic: Caused by humans.
Greenhouse gases: gases that warm the earth.
This is a fine definition, but too narrow. Humans change global climate other ways (e.g., agriculture), and some changes of interest are not to the climate (e.g., sea-level rise).
What other GHGs are there?

Climate change: Changes in climate driven by increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
Impacts: Socially-relevant changes to physical or economic systems from climate change.
Damages: The cost or benefits of impacts (typically in GDP or welfare terms).
Adaptation: Any actions taken (behaviors, infrastructure) to avoid damages (also has costs).
Mitigation (or Abatement): Any actions taken to reduce GHG emissions (also has costs).
Business-as-usual: The emissions, damages, adaptation, and mitigation taken without policy intervention or global cooperation,

And here is a transcript of the lecture going through the slides:

And  so  like  depending  on what  like  I  guess one  that  we  choose  whether  to  do  that. Yeah.  So  like  the reading  the  chapters  and doing  the  guided  assignments. That  one,  do  you still  do  like  a  presentation  pro so  the  That  would  be  isn't  said, that's  it's  for  press. Yes.  Would  it  be  possible  to  like  do the  chapter  thing  and  then also  do  the  presentation? Because  I  think  that  probably pretty  beneficial. Okay.  Okay.  Thanks. You  think  if  it's  like  imagine always  mixes  the  matches,  but  Okay. Yeah.  I  just  want  to  like  I  want  to do  the  presentations  something. I  think  I  was  going  to  ask  you  bod  to  sort  of declare  after  the  try to  put  out  the  first  lap. Okay.  So  Okay. Yeah,  we'll  try  to  figure  out a  way  to  give  that  option  of  it.  Just  yeah, Pens  Foss.  Thank  you. Time  here that  selling, hopefully  it  with  my  wife. Just taking as  we  go, trying  to  decide  if  that's  better. Because  I'm  all  worried  that  the  whole  thing, large  actual  confusion,  that's  better. Just  like  wait  til the  end  of  the  class,  forgot  to, things  are  confused  about, this  is  the  class  time,  where  it  is. That's  a  great  question. Class  with  the  snow  and  this  morning? Yeah.  I  started  I  just  woke  up. Sorry  that  was  late. No,  I  just  wasn't  sure  if  I  should start  so  that  I hand  out  exit  tickets  early,  both. So  you  can  just  all  because  they  got the  reading  quiz  one  that  pre I'm  just  concerning  the  I take  the  transcript  from this  and  then  I  go  to  the  AI. And  so  I  don't  know  if  you've  ever  read like  an  audio  transcript from  one  of  these  things, but  it's  a  mess. If  it  looks  like  nothing  you  said, it  was  the  least  incoherent, but  you  don't  really care  about  it  because  like no  one's  going  to  ever  read  it. But  now  the  AI  is  reading  this  and  then this  is  like  reporting  back  to  you  guys, whatever  it  thinks  it  say. I  did  test  it  out  and  I  asked, when  are  the  quizzes? But  it  told  me  that  like  week  one  quiz, week  one,  week  two, quiz  23,  and  the  syllabus  I  was  like, that  doesn't  seem  right. So  I  don't  know. It's  not  there.  Okay.  It's  useful. I  mean,  intuitively,  that's  the  way  I  think. I  think  that  if you're  trying  to  say  like  it's a  week  with  quiz  like,  you  know, you  could  have  retreat. Okay.  I'm  going  to,  I'm  going  to  started, feel  free  to,  to  jot down  on  the  exit  tickets  of  speak. So,  hoping  to  finish the  basis  of  clinic  science  today. I  was  looking  back  at the  way  that  this  worked out  two  years  ago and  I  was  still  doing climate  sling  in  doing  three  somehow. We'll  see  it  works. And  then  I  want  to,  this  is  supposed  to  say, yeah,  discussion  of  the  role  of surge  is  what  we're  going to  talk  about  on  Thursday. Reading  quiz  is  today  on  your  exit  ticket. The  first  lab  is  going to  be  released  on  Thursday. I'm  going  to  be  asking  you  guys to  sort  of  declare  which  of the  two  paths  you  want  to take  after  I  release  the  lab. So  you  can  actually  see, you  know,  what  the  difference  is. I  think  actually  the differences  that  are  going  to  be, the  differs  of  the  labs  are  going  to  be. So  it's  not  super  important that  anyone  gets  locked  into some  of  the  Well, you  have  all  the  information  that's  that's the  time  line  we talked  about  defining  climate  change. And  in  terms  of changes  in  climate  driven by  genic  greenhouse  gases. I  didn't  define  was anthbrogenic  greenhouse  gases. Transpogenic  means  caused  by  humans  driven  by humans  generate an  greenhouse  gases  are  gas  there. We're  going  to  be  talking  more  about  what greenhouse  gases  are  and  why  they work  in  this  lecture, but  what  are  the  greenhouse  gases? When  I  say  that, do  you  guys  know  which gases  I'm  checking  about? Methddeth  discusses. Yeah.  Yeah.  So  these  are, these  are  probably  the  two  big  yeah. And  did  you  also  say  so? Yeah.  So  they're  also they're  also  sulfates  which  act  as  aerosols. They  act  as  as  gases  that  block  the  sun. Radiation  from  each  Earth  cools  things  down. This  definition  isn't  quite  right. Be  greenhouse  gases  are generally  gases  that  affect the  weight  of  the  earth, traps  from  the  sun  and  warms. Most  of  the  ones  that  we're  concerned about  are  the  ones  that  warm  us  up. But  you  could  also  go  gases that  water  vapor  count. Water  vapor  is the  most  important  greenhouse  gas, but  it's  not  prog, we're  not  doing  anything to  water  vapor  atmosphere. We'll  talk  about  the  feedback  that  gets  it, but  it  is  absolutely  greenhouse  gas. Here,  the  way  that  this  definition  is, isn't  complete  is  that we're  changing  climate  in important  ways  including  like where  rainfall  flaw  falls, lot  of  ways  other  than  releasing sew  to  the  atmosphere. When  we  do  large  scale  agriculture, it  actually  changes  the  climate locally  in  if  ways and  can  be  detected  globally. There  are  lots  of  ways  that the  Earth  system  is  changing  that isn't  particularly  the climate  system  changing, like  sea  level  rise. This  is  what  we  talk  about,  climate  change, but  actually  we're  going  to  talk  about things  that  are  more general  than  just  changes in  the  climate  per  se, from  greenhouse  gases  per  se  though. This  is  the  core.  This  is, by  the  way,  a  very  fuzzy  picture of  rated  forcing. I'm  going  to  talk  about rated  forcing  later  on, but  this  is  along  the  rows here  are  key  greenhouse  gases. What's  actually  admitted  here  and  then  here? What  drives  changes  in  the  atmosphere. Don't  include  water  vapor  here  but  that's included  in  the  flation  CO two  C  four  which  is not  holo  carbons  which  are  things  like the  CFC's  two  nitrousxide  lacking  gas which  is  it  comes from some  industrial  processes  nationally  Sure. Carbon  monoxide, nonmthane,  voltile  organic  compounds which  contribute  a  little  bit. And  then  Knox,  which  is  mostly  reducing the  total  amount  of  energy  coming  down to  the  surface  here. It's  aerosols  and  precursors and  these  are  things that  they're  capturing  the same  way  that  the  gas  is  capturing  light. They're  not  picking  up bands  of  electron  radiation. They're  actually  dust  in  the  air. That's  actually  what  this  first  says, mineral  dust  is  one  of  the Anthropogenic  things  that  we put  into  the  atmosphere, that  changes  the  climate  because  we are  put  activity  in  places that  are  dust  there. That's,  that's  the  whole  segment  here. Sulfate,  you  remember  sulfates and  sulfites.  Remember  which  one? Injection  sulfate,  that's  a  for  sulighthie, which  one  is  released  by, say,  cars  and  industrial  processes. Sulfates, I  think  there's  a  yeah, so  exhaust  and  other  distributes produce  a  lot  of  sulfates  and  sulphites  and, or  one  of  the  fun  things that  they  also  do  when  they're  in the  atmosphere  is  that  when  they  rain out,  they  produce  acid. Because  we  mix  sulfur  microlatelp  with  water, you  get  to  hydrosulfuric  acid, sulphuric  and  carbons  there. And  then  there's  a  big  chunk  on the  right  which  is  an  air  sol. So  it's,  it's  dust  in  the  air, but  it's  actually  warming the  planet  and  it's they're  legally  black  carbon. Anyone  know  what  that is?  What's  going  on  there? It's  just  batter.  Is  that  true? It's,  it's  not  usually, that's  like  the  main  cause  but  patterns. Okay. Black  carbon  is  also  just like  if  you  have  a  coal  fire, it's  going  to  put  a  bunch  of, there's  a  hole  dust  in  the  atmosphere. Whenever  it  stands  going  to  be  black  carbon. It's  a  narrow  soul.  It's  in  the  atmosphere. When  it's  up  in  the  atmosphere, it's  going  to  provide  some  amount  of  cooling effect  because  it's  going  to, the  sub  variation is  going  to  reach  the  ground. But  carbon  doesn't  stay  in the  atmosphere  very  long, falls  to  the  ground. Now  you've  got  something  which is  on  the  surface  of  the  Earth. It's,  it's  going  to  absorb solar  radiation  and warm  surface  of  the  planet. So  I  looked  it  up  and  it says  carbon  black  is  the  product  of incomplete  combustion or  thermal  decomposition of  heavy  controlled  products. So  I  don't  know,  carbon  black  carbon never  heard  carbon  black  additive. And  looking  at  its  believe that  this  is  not  the same  as  black  cab  carbon  is  generally, but  it  is  incompletely  combusted,  right? If  you  completely  combust  pole, you'll  just  get  O,  but if  you  incompletely  combusted, you'll  get  black  carbon  dust. So  there  might  two  different  things  that, I  mean,  I  think  that  they're  missing out  things  but  they're  like  very. Okay. So  just  to  give  you  a  bunch of  other  terms  so  that I  don't  forget  to  do  it  later, but  we'll  hopefully  remember  to  do all  these  as  we  go  through  them  in  the  class. Climate  change  is  going  to the  result  in  impacts. Impacts  are  changes  to social  or  biological  systems that  we  care  about. Then  because  this  is  a  class  on  economics, we're  going  to  often  be translating  impacts  into  damages. Damages  are  an  equivalence  loss in  income  or  dollar  terms that  for  a  given  impact, say  equivalent  cost  is. A  lot  of  these  impacts  are  actually going  to  make  people  poor  directly. They're  going  to  result  in  welfare  losses. And  the  welfare  losses, we're  going  to  want  to  term of  the  dollars  and  we're  going  to  show  them into  welfare  terms  which we  can  say  are  equivalent to  a  certain  amount  of  dollars  loss  value. You  can  have  adaptation, which  is  any  action  that  someone  might  take, including  things  like  just changing  their  behaviors  when they  decide  to  doors, for  example,  in  order  to  avoid  damages. You  can  also  imagine  infrastructure like  the  tennis  wall  to  avoid  damages. Both  of  those  are under  this  rubric  of  adaptation. Mitigation  is reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions is  also  called  abatement  of  mitigation, although  where  they're  used  is  slightly Um,  nuanced,  the  synonyms. They're  both  referring  to the  reduction  in  gas  emissions. That  is  a  super  confusing use  of  the  term  mitigation, though  I  just  got into  an  argument  with  someone on  a  proposal  that  we're writing  because  she  says, I  want  to  make  sure  that  they  know that  we're  talking  about  mitigation. And  I  said,  no,  we're  not,  we're  not  talking about  the  reduction  of  pasmissions. She  said,  yes,  we  are.  We're  talking about  mitigating the  impacts  of  climate  change. Mitigating  the  impact  of  climate change  is  what  I'm defining  as  adaptation  in  general. When  says  I'm  concerned about  mitigating the  impacts  of  climate  change, it's  clear  that  they're talking  about  some  sort of  reduction  of these  impacts  and  ages,  right? They're  not  talking  about  reducing  emissions. But  if  you  use  the  term  mitigation, I  want  to  engage  in  mitigation. I  want  to  support  or  study  mitigation. What  you  mean  in the  literature  is  reduction in  rehouse  gas  emissions, not  the  mitigation  of  impacts. It's  the  mitigation  of  climate change  that  makes  sense. Super  confusing  as  the  fact  that mitigation  could  mean  anything and  then  the  fact  that  there  are  two  terms, another  word,  abatement, that  also  could  mean  anything. But  actually,  unless  there are  additional  words  to  make  it  clear, mitigation  and  abatement  both  refer  to just  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions. And  then  we're  going  to talk  about  different  scenarios. We'll  get  into  this  a  little  bit. One  of  those  scenarios  is  business  as  Usual, which  is  everything  that would  happen  if  we  don't do  something  policy  driven,  right? Included  in  business  as  usual  is a  bunch  of  adaptation  measures that  people  are  just  naturally  going  to  take. People  are  going  to  respond  to  the  things that  are  happening  and  they're going  to  adapt  to  them. They're  going  to  naturally reduce  their  impact  and damages  from  what  they  would  otherwise be  part  of  business  as  usual. Part  of  business  as  usual  is  that  people are  going  to  respond  to the  decrease  in  the  cost  of renewable  energy  and  they're  going  to build  more  renewable  energy  plants. Business  usual  doesn't  mean unfettered  two  emissions  or at  least  unlimited  two  emissions. It  just  means  that  there  isn't  some  sort  of coordinated  effort  to  change what  people  individually  would  do. So  it's  a  question  of  whether there's  a  public  response versus  a  private  response. Business  as  usual  is  only  responses. And  then  you  can  imagine  a  whole  suite  of policy  changes  that  are allowing  us  to  move  away  from  this  as  usual. Either  if  this  is, we're  talking  about  scenarios  of less  climate  change by  engaging  in  mitigation, reducing  energy  gas  emissions. Or  you  could  imagine  people  talking about  business  as  usual in  the  context  of  impacts. And  then  saying,  oh  well, if  we  invest  in publicly  supported  adaptation  that  we  can, we  can  reduce  the  damages relative  to  business  as  usual. Usually  usually  uses  a  mitigation  thing, but  business  as  usual  just  means  unless, unless  there's  as  intervention by  damage  we  as  we  also, is  this  the  reason  because  as a  whole  is  much  better  than  it's, it's,  because  there's  a, there's  a  sine  flip  here. So  you  can  have  positive  or  negative  damages. Positive  damages  means  that  welfare  lost. It's  actual  costs  of negative  damages  that  you benefit  damages  is  the  total  sum of  any  of  those  costs  and  benefits. And  it  could  be  positive  or  negative. It's  just  that  the  sign  is such  that  a  positive  number  is  bad. Okay,  so  let's  talk about  the  fundamental  physics of  rehouse  gasps, which  fortunately  CD  guy just  mentioned  last  week that  we've  known  about. You  figured  out  the  redhouseasph closer  to  the  start  of the  destro  revolution  than today.  It's  pretty  amazing. We've  started,  we've  been putting  CO  two  deamosphere  since 1,776.1  of  the  early  papers that  laid  out  the. Was  about  120  years  later. Basic  points  to  make  here  first  is water  vapor  is  the  most important  greenhouse  gas. We'll  talk  about  that. Co  two  is  the  most  important antropogenic  greenhouse  gas. There  are  lots  of  reservoirs of  CO  two  around  the  Earth  system. They  turn  time  scales and  that's  important  for understanding  the  consequences of  doing  emissions  today. Tims  turn  out  to  be an  insight  that  happened  just  in the  two  IBCs  ago. Um.  Emissions  turn  out  to  be a  great  predicture  global  temperature  change. When  we  build  in  assessment  model, we'll  use  this  insight, I'll  show  you  what  it  means, but  basically  it  turns  out  that the  whole  system  looks  like  it's  fairly linear  in  its  response  to  rest  emissions. Then  the  poles  or temperate  zones  and  land  were past  a  lot  of  the  time  when  we're talking  about  global  warming, we're  going  to  talk  about global  mean  surface  temperature  change,  MST. Mst  is  the  average  temperature that's  potentially  useful. It's  a  really  useful  concept from  natural  science  perspective. Not  necessarily  such  a  useful  concept from  a  human  perspective, because  where  people  are, people  don't  average  experience  MST, nor  do  they  experience  the  changes  in GMSTelandland  faster  than  the  oceans. Any  time  that  you  think  about  for  example, a  1.5  degree  target, The  Intermitte  says,  we  want to  keep  global  temperatures  down  below  two, rising  more  than  two  degrees  and ideally  not  more  than  1.5  degrees. They're  talking  about global  mean  temperature  rise. A  global  mean  tempature  rise  of  1.5  degrees, actually  means  land  tempature  rise of  degrees, temperate  zone  temperature rise  of  two  degrees, actually  we're  talking  about is  not  the  temperature  changes that  we're  going  to  be  experiencing. Okay,  let  me  break  this  down. Those  are  the  big  points. I'm  going  to  call  a  bunch  of  things  that aren't  clysar  of  the  cyst. I  want  to  tell  you  about all  of  these  different  fans. I'm  going  to  do  it across  a  bunch  of  different  slides, but  I  don't  have  too much  to  say  about  each  one of  the  climate  system consists  of  the  atmosphere. The  atmosphere  has  many  different  layers. I'm  currently  reading Stevenson's  Termination  Shock, which  is  a  book  about  engineering  and particular  about solar  radiation  management  for full  course  where  they're, what  they're  doing  is  putting  a  bunch of  sulfur  dioxide  into the  stratosphere  in  the  same  way that  that  volcanoes  puts  the  atmosphere. And  as  a  result  of  doing so,  cooling  the  plant. So  both  volcano  cool  plant  and  people  plant, um,  if  they,  if  they  wanted to  do  Southern  stratosphere, that  isn't  where  we  live. We  lived  up  here  in  the  troposphere. The  other  interesting  thing to  mention  here  is just  know  all  how  to read  this  pressure  graph. What's  going  on  with atmosphere  pressure  here. The  hyper  bishop.  Sure,  does  it  do  that  line? So  it's  a  line. But  look  at  the  axis  here. This  is,  this  is  a  log  scale  which  means that  as  you  go  the  atmosphere virtually  decreasing  by  or  by factors  at  about  the  tropos, the  height  of  the  top  of  the  troposphere, your  atmosphere  pressure  is a  tenth  of  what  is  at  the  surface. You  go  up  to  two  times  that much  to  the  height  of the  stress  sphere  and  you're at  100th  of  what  that  was. So  you  Pq  is  me. Hydrosphere  is  something  that  I'm sure  you  all  know  very  much  about. So  I'm  not  going  to  go  into you  particularly  about  that, except  to  say  that  it's the  key  way  that energy  is  transported around  the  Earth  system, the  cryosphere,  the  ice  covered  parts of  the  pens  are  technically, you  could  mention  that  the  tychic part  of  the  hydrosphere, talking  about  frozen  ice,  they  consist  of, the  cases  consists  of  ice  caps, glaciers,  permafrost,  and  sea  ice. It  has  a  whole  bunch  of  important  roles to  play  in  this  process. It's  going  to  be  where  we  get  sea  level  rise, permafrost  melting  is  going  to  be  one  of the  primary  drivers  of  climate  ticking  points where  as  climate  happens  the  so  system  starts to  go  into  a  pozzi  warm  on  its  own. We're  also  going  to  talk  about  how skis  changes  the  albo  of  the  planet which  the  lithosphere  is the  arc  of  the  planet. It's  where  we  got  all  of  our  fossil  fuels. It's  also  potentially  where  we  would  watch, put  over  capture  CO  two  for  example. Another  way  that  we  could do  something  like  geo  engineering, but  perhaps  green,  is  to  plant  bo  trees. The  problem  with  planting  boing  trees when  they  fully  grown, you  can't  let  them  go  through their  natural  life  cycle and  release  all  that  CO  two  back  atosphere. That  will  defeat  the  purpose. Basically  we  have  to  do  is cut  down  all  those  trees, put  them  into  the  ground  spot  sphere where  where  the  COwo that  they  capture  won't  get  released. And  then  you  have  to  plain  new  force. It's  not  actually  entirely  true  by  the  way, force  to  continue  to  capture  carbon after  they've  reached  their  pole  height. But  the  most  efficient  way to  do  it  will  be  cdte. A  good  place  to  put  carbon  into the  biosphere  is  all of  an  plant,  mostly  on  planet. It  takes  up  and  releases  CO  two. We  have  the  wiggles  on  graph. It's  also  actually  a  significant  source of  greenhouse  gas  emissions because  we  are  currently engaged  in  a  massive  global  effort to  change  the  land  surface from  land  use  types  that  have carbon  forces  to  sets  carbon  range. Agriculture  also  potentially  important, mainly  was  important  as a  pre  industrial  driver  of  changes. So  those  are  all  the  pieces of  the  climate  system  actually, they  were  all  represented in  previous  CC  cartoon. What  the  natural  scientists  study from  change  are  trying  to study,  as  you  can  see  here. Well,  they're  trying  to  study  the  biosphere. In  particular,  this  atmospheric biosphere  attraction. They're  trying  to  look at  lithosphere  and  the  land  surface. And  there's  land  amospherettractions, cryosphere  and  all  the  ways that  snow  and  frost  ground and  all  that  is  changing. There's  a  volcanic  activity  releasing some  nice  aerosols  in the  atmosphere,  hydrosphere. And  I  think  they put  it  here  for the  same  reason  I  put  it  there, which  is  that  water  is  really important  without  really  knowing reason  why  it  put  it  here. Because  they  just  say, oh,  you  mean  the  ocean,  ocean, there's  rise,  we  have  to  study  that. And  then  changes  in  soil  inputs. Mostly  that  would  be  relevant if  we  were  not changing  the  reading how  speculation  ourselves. But  in  fact,  there  are  constantly  changes  in solar  inputs  that  are mainly  Noise  a  bunch  of  minor, minor,  I  don't  think  I  included  this in  the  graph,  in  the  slides  here, but  does  anyone  know  what  was  expected  to happen  to  global  temperatures if  we  hadn't  started  putting CO  two  to  the  atmosphere? In  the  Industrial  Repolutionk? What  we're  on  a  trend  for, we're  actually  headed  slowly. Course  of  10,000  years or  something  toward  our  next  ice  age. We  were  on  a  downwardectory. A  lot  of  these,  like  if  you look  at  temperature  over the  last  10,000  years, there's  heat  out  of  our  CH, and  then  it  sort  of stabilizes  and  goes  back  forth. And  then  it  slowly  starts  to  go  down. And  then  right  at  the  point  where it's  slowly  starting  to  go  down, then  we  add  on  the  theogenicies, Not  saying  that  humans did  something  good  or bad  in  staying  off  of  the  ice  age, but  that's  just,  that's  what the  trial  system  was  sort of  on  track  to next  and  that's  because of  changes  in  the  in  the  solar. Okay.  Don't  get  to  next. Get  into  some  more  details  of  carbon  cycle. Before  I  do  that  question,  is  that  liquid? It's  a  set  of  cycles called  the  Lincoln  cycles, which  are  a  combination of  procession  and  also  the  liquidity  of, of  the  Earth's  orbit. And  a  few  other  things. There  are  like  four  different  time scape  scales  and  cycles  that  are, that  are  combined  to  tell  each  other  the  one that  drives  suggest  the  procession. That,  that  sounds  right. But yeah, it  also  depends  on  so  that  the, the  other  is  on  a  slight  tilt and  that  is  not  is  completely  sable. Actually,  it's  sort  of going  in  a  little  circle where  it's  slightly  more  tilted, slightly  less  tilted  over the  course  of  a  long  periods. This  is  this  presumptional  thing  and that  why  that  causes changes  in  tetre  has  to do  with  where  landmass  is. Basically.  If  land  mass are  somewhere  else  then  it  wouldn't cause  the  same  effects  that  it  causes. But  yeah, we're  fairly  top  heavy right  now  so  it  has  these  effects. Any  other  questions  about scope  of  the  climate  system? Okay,  so  let's  get  into  the  carbon  cycle. So  this  is  a  diagram  of the  flexes  and  reservoirs of  carbon  across  the  throat  system. And  I'll  dig  into  different  ones  of  them, but  different  numbers that  are  just  displayed. There  are  flows  of  carbon into  and  out  of different  systems,  different  reservoirs. And  the  reservoirs  are  large  here, and  the  numbers  and press  are  the  size  of  those. How  many  tons  of carbon  are  in  the  reservoirs? Whereas  the  flows  are  on  gigatons  per  year. How  quickly  these  are  flowing  in. The  first  one  is  when  this  agree  was  made. We're  putting  about  six  gigatons of  carbon  into  the  atmosphere  per  year. Does  anyone  know  how  many  gigatons of  carbon  dioxide? You're  not  putting  it,  it's about  37  gigatons  of  carbon  dioxide  now. Carbon  carbon  dioxide. The  difference  between  those is  it's  a  atomic  weight  ratio. It's  about  3.7  We're  now  at about  ten  gigatons  of carbon  that  we're  releasing  per  year. That's  what's  going,  that's our  contribution  to  the  whole  system. You  can  easily  see  that's smaller  than  most  of  the  numbers  here. It's  quite  a  bit  smaller than  most  of  the  numbers  here. For  example,  we  six  is  about 100th  of  the  total  two  carbon rather  in  the  atmosphere. At  that  rate,  we  expect 100  years  to  double the  total  amount  of  Botox  in  the  atmosphere. Now  that  we're  at more  like  ten  tons  of  carbon  per  year, we're  actually  talking  about  60  years, but  it's  not  like  in the  course  of  a  few  years  we  could have  an  enormous  effect on  total  CO  two  in  the  atmosphere, and  that's  one  of  the  smaller. Numbers  amongst  these  stocks.  What  happens? I'm  going  to  go  to  keep  it  this number  six  because  actually it  scales  all  the  numbers  here  scale. So  if  you  want  the  real  numbers  just scale  by  three  halves. So  what  happens  to  that? The  extra  six  tons of  carbon  diggins  of  carbon, about  half  of  the  third  one are  taken  up  by  the  biosphere. Plaster  of  carbide  grows very  well  when  there's a  lot  of  carboxidegraps. It's  been  taken  up,  then  becomes  part  of this  posynthesis  cycle  where it's  taken  up,  released. But  fortunately there's  a  natural  soil  carbon  pump, Plants  store  some  amount of  the  carbon  dioxide that  they  take  up  in  this  deeper, so  carbon  reservoir  rather than  just  release  the  atmosphere. This  is  basically  how carbon  full  soils  get  produced  over  here. Probably  the  biggest  thing  that's taking  up  some  of  the  carboxide  out atmospheres  and  carboxin  count, about  a  third  of  it  is taken  out  by  the  oceans. It's  being  absorbed  into  the  surface  ocean. And  then  part  of  that  that's  taken  up  into the  surface  ocean  is  then being  brought  down  into  the  deep  ocean. Now  there  are  likely  limits to  how  much  the  surface  ocean can  absorb  of  carboxi. If  you  increase  the  level of  concentration  in  the  atmosphere, you  will  increase  the  amount  of  carbon  that the  surface  in  equilibrium once  take  up  trying to  come  to  some  equilibrium. And  you  have  more amisherei  have  one  surfaceion, but  the  surface  ocean only  has  so  much  capacity  to  take  carbon. It  as  we're  putting more  and  more  in  the  atmosphere. That  capacity  is  being used  up  and  the  equilibrium  is going  to  be  giving  us  slightly less  benefit  for  every  bit  of. So  now  also  figures made  about  a  third  of  it  is  ions. The  depot  mostly  has  not  been  responding to  the  Pre  change. Devotion  is  fairly  insulated  change. Some  of  my  colleagues  in the  Marine  school  about  this, they'll  object  to  that  principle because  they're  setting some  really  fast  flexes  that  are happening  between  surface  and  deep  ocean. That  turns  out  that  the  Lisa around  the  poles  and  in some  other  isolated  places. But  for  the  most  part,  there's very  little  interaction  between deep  ocean  and  the  atmosphere. And  it's  all  suffered  by  the  surface. What  we'll  see,  we're expecting  to  see  over  the  course of  t  five  centuries  or  something. Is  that  the  surface  socia  is  going  to be  filled  up  with  carbon  dioxide. And  the  deep  ocean  is  going to  slowly  start  to respond  to  that  rock. 78  million,  is  that 70  million  gigatons  carbon  kison. Okay.  And  so  the  biosphere  takes  less  carbon, but  it  has  a  much  higher  capacity versus  the  ocean. No,  this  is  the  plant  biomass is  at  this  500  gigaton  level. So  this  is  here.  So  this  is, this  is  actually  like  the, the  rock  of  the  Earth. The  surface  of  the  Earth  is  made of  hast  of  carbon. Part  of  that  is  carbon that  we  can  actually  access. But  a  lot  of  it  is  just sort  of  residual  carbonates  in  the  minerals. And  so  it's,  it's  there but  unless  we  release, which  was  is  retract  all  this  time, they  just  want  to  sort  put  it here  as  a  as  pointed  comparison. That  actually,  yes,  I was  confused  like  for  a  second. Just  because  I  thought  it  was  talking about  capacity.  No,  no. This  is  how  much  now this  is  actually  capacity. It's  all  how  much  carbon is  actually  in  each  of  these  things? Yeah,  yeah.  Already  mentioned  this.  Yeah. So  we  have  some  amount  of two  that's  being  sequestered  into  carbon. Some  amount  of  two.  Sequestered. But  those  are,  those  are, those  are  useful  processes  were. So  the  question  is, we're  putting  this  residual three  to  four  gigatons of  carbon  now. Six  to  seven  gigaomes  of carbon  in  the  atmosphere. What's  that  going  to  do? How  does  this  whole  greenhouse  gas  to  work? To  break  that  out, I'm  going  to  break the  atmosphere  of  the  Earth into  a  couple  of  different  layers. These  are  all  what are  called  zero  dimensional  models, basically  moving  climate  model. But  my  climate  model is  just  going  to  be  about total  energy  balance  for a  thing  that's  taken  in energy  from  the  sign  and  releasing  energy. The  sign.  It's  zero  dimensional because  I  haven't  represented, for  example,  Latin  longitude. There  are  other  models that  are  one  dimensional, which  capture  the  way  that  you,  for  example, have  four  temtsmal  extreme  parts  of the  little  bit  and  more  temperatures around  the  equation  model. A  zero  dimensional  model  would  actually show  the  components  and  things, but  to  get  at the  basics  of  the  greenhouse  got  spec, we  need  to  have  a  zero  dimensional  model. What  we,  what  we have  here  is  energy  coming  in from  the  sun  100  units. It's  normal  to  100% of  the  sun's  energy  is  coming  into. This  is  the  top  surface  of  the  atmosphere. I'm  going  to  remove this  black  piece  in  a  minute. Which  is  so  we  can understand  what's happening  within  the  atmosphere. But  start  out  with,  we  have  a  whole  bunch of  radiation  that's  coming  into the  top  surface  of  the  atmosphere. Some  of  that's  be  reflective. About  30%  is  bouncing  right off  of  either  the  clouds  this  piece  is, or  the  surface  of the  Earth  because  it's  a  reflective  surface. And  going  right  back  out  to  space, you  have  about  70%  of the  solar  radiation  from  the  sun  being absorbed  by  the  black  box. That  means  that  just for  us  to  be  in  energy  patterns, 70%  of  the  sun's  radiation has  to  be  released  by that  black  box  as  some  form  of  energy. It's  no  longer  in the  same  wavelengths  as  the  sun  had. It's  infrared  energy. It's  going  to  be  released  because this  whole  body, that  is  Earth,  from the  view  at  the  top  of  the  atmosphere, a  certain  average  temperature. So  it's  just  going  to  be  giving out  as  at  radiation. So  that's  what  we  have  here. And  then  one  over  on  the  right  here, that  particular  energy  balance,  100  goes  in, and  70  plus  3,100  okay, is  the  other  part  of  the  graph. Nothing  that  we  do, by  the  way,  is  going  to  change. Nothing  that  we  do  with greenhouse  gases  is  going to  change  this  part  of  the  picture. All  that's  going  to  have  greenhouse  gases  is what  happens  within  the  atmosphere, the  surface  of  the  Earth. We  have  the  atmosphere. And  then  we're  going  to  talk  about the  flexes  between  them. For  each  of  these  different  pieces, we  have  to  have  the  same  energy. Whatever  it  goes  in  has  to  go  out. If  we  didn't  have  that  goes  in,  going  out, then  we  would  have  changes  in  Tu, which  will  get  to  the  slides, a  whole  bunch  of the  70%  of  the  subradation that  didn't  get  reflected  back, absorbed  by  the  Earth,  absorbed  by the  gases  in  the  atmosphere  there. Then  we  have  the  atmosphere itself  being  the  main  thing, spreading  things  back  out, or  is  it  thickening  its  energy? It's  energy  partly  from the  25%  of  the  sud that  absorbed  directly  by  the  atmosphere. The  rest  of  its  radiation  getting from  process  from  the  Earth's  surface. The  direct  radiation, the  surface  being  warm or  atmospheric  processes, basically,  flow  of  water that  are  transporting  energy. Let's  do  our  mass  balances. At  the,  at  the  top  here  for  the  atmosphere, the  vertical  one,  we  have 25  units coming  into  the  atmosphere  from  the  sun. And  then  we  have  these  two  chunks here  which  come  up  to  133  units that  are  coming  up  from  the  surface. 133  units  of  Mar. Then  that's  equal  to whatever  is  going  out  of  the  atmosphere. Well,  before  we  said that  sun  was  going  out  of space  and  so  there's 88  that's  going  down  the  other  direction. That's  how  the  atmosphere itself  stays  in  balance. You  can  do  the  same  thing  with the  surface  of  the  Earth. 45  comes  in  from  the  sun. 88  comes  in  from the  aspect  of  the  atmosphere. And  what's  going  out  is  this  29  plus  this  14, ignoring  these  reflective  pieces, because  we  already  do, those  also  come  out  to, these  come  out  to  158, whichever  you  do  the  math, and  these  come  out  to  133 Pth  is  the  right  matter. What  they  come  out  to  for the  purpose  of  energy  balance. What  matters  is  the  balance. So  the  greenhouse  gas  effect  is the  fact  at  this  point  just  that some  of  the  radiation that's  communicating  surface  of the  Earth  gets  captured  by the  atmosphere,  the  atmosphere. It's  a  warm  body.  Any  warm  body, it's  going  to  be  making  radiation, going  to  go  and  right, you're  going  to  have a  radiating  all  directions. The  fact  that  we  saw  70  units  going  out  to space  meant  that  you  probably  could  have guessed  there  was  going  to be  something  on  the  order of  some  of  the  units. Also  going  downwards, the  atmosphere  itself  is  warm, it's  going  to  be  reading  both  directions. That  some  unit  is  going downwards  is  then  going  to  have  to  be balanced  by  this  Earth surface  also  reading  a  lot  of G.  These  two  combined have  to  more  or  less  balance. And  that's  why  the  regional  obvious. But  this  also  means  that  if this  central  layer of  atmosphere  wasn't  there, these  two  pieces  would  be there  would  be  here. And  you  would  just  get  70  units  out. 70  units  out  is  a  lot  less  than  133  units. And  what  that  means  in  hyper  terms  is just  that  the  surface  of  the  Earth  is a  warmer  than  the  surface  of  the  atmosphere. So  what  would  determine, because  you're  talking  about how  volcanic  skews  for  into, into  the  atmosphere  and  that  can  cool. What  determines  whether  greenhouse  gas or  so  warms  versus cool  has  a  que,  it's  going  to  be, it's  going  to  depend  on  whether  it's  opaque to  some  wavelengths  versus  Earth  Walths, the  sun  is,  is  in  the  visible  spectrum. It's  a  lot  shorter  wavelengths than  the  Earth  because  the  Earth is  a  much  cooler  body. It's  going  to  be  producing  things  at a  much  lower  wavelength. Technically,  for  each,  each  element  or  each, each  compound  has  a  different  set of  chunks  of  the  spectrum that  it  absorbs  and it's  transparent  to  the  rest. And  that's  why  some  of these  things  recaptured. So  I'm  going  to  go  back to  this  in  just  a  moment  and  talk  about  how adding  new  two  detmosphere  changes  things. And  hopefully  if  you're  lokfused  about what  we  actually  do  with this  stuff,  it'll  be  a  little  clear. Let  me  say  this, which  we've  got  the  zero  dimensional  model of  the  Earth  system. It's  just  an  energy  balance  model, but  it  already  tells  us different  ways  that  we  could imagine  changing  global  mean  surface. But  we  can  change  it  by  doing  basically. One  is  if  you  could  change  the  amount  of solar  radiation  as  we were  talking  about  the  sun,  we  actually  do. You  change  that  influence,  warm  pol  thing. If  you  change  the  fraction of  solar  ation  that  gets  reflected, let's  say  a  veto,  then  that's going  to  change  the  calculations. And  if  you  change the  neutral  greenhouse  gas  effect, going  to  show  you  how  that  works. I'll  show  you  what  it  means  here. If  you  change,  the  greenhouse  gas effect  is  going  to  be a  temporary  change  in  the  amount of  infrared  radiation  emitted  to  space. I've  been  telling  you  all the  side  that  these  things  have  to  be an  equilibrium,  not  technically  true. You  could  have,  if  you  put a  little  bit  more  to  tube  the  atmosphere, then  some  of  this  radiation from  the  Earth  is  going  to  get  trapped. It's  not  going  to  get  out  of  space When  that  happens, the  whole  system  is  going  to be  having  more  energy  in  than  energy  out. When  that  happens,  something  warms  up. That's  good,  because  that's  the  natural  way that  science, that's  the  natural  way  that  a  thing gets  back  to  equilibrium. Once  warms  up,  it's  not releasing  more  energy  out, the  radiation  is  going to  come  back  to  equilibration. Okay,  this  sp  here  saying, I  want  to  show  you  how  to discuss  emissions  change  the  egression. It  turns  out  that  the  way  they  change the  equation  is  gradually, it's  not  going  to  cause  it, thing  spot  for  example. What  happens  when  you  suddenly  double the  two  in  the  atmosphere to  surface  temperature? In  one  of  the  B  clean  models, you  can  see  that  it  takes  from 1960  to  maybe  2020 for  that  instantaneous  change in  atmosphere  to  come  to  a  ngrams. See  where  that  we  put  a  puff  of  two  Amos. An  additional  thing  that's  going  to  capture, it's  transparent  to  salt. What's  going  to  capture  radiation coming  up  from  the  Earth. This  104  hasn't  changed. If  without,  but  because more  captured  by  this  no  gas, less  of  it's  going  out  of  space. That  imbalance  is  going  to  step  two, cause  the  atmosphere  heat, It's  going  to  heat  up  to  the  point where  it's  going  to  start  setting off  some  chunk  of radiation  up  to  space and  down  to  the  Earth's  surface. When  I  do  that,  I  shrunk  The  size  of the  imbalance  here  of  our  debt  to  the  sun. May  go  away,  rely  because  it, but  now  we've  got additional  radiation coming  back  down  to  Earth. The  atmosphere  is  warming  up. And  now  that  atmosphere  is  trying to  warm  up  the  surface  of  the  Earth. But  great,  now  we've got  an  imbalance  on  the  Earth. That  means  that  the  Earth  surface is  going  to  heat. So  there's  a  surface  coming up  and  that's  going  to cause  there  to  be  additional  radiation coming  out  this  way. That's  going  to  cause  further heating  of  the  atmosphere until  we've  equal  rated the  mountain  radiation  is going  up  to  the  sun. And  at  that  point,  these  two are  going  to  basically  also  cancel  out. The  amount  of  energy  that  goes  up  into the  sun  is  going to  equal  what's  coming  in  from  the  sun. The  amount  that's  going  into  the atmosphere  is  going  to  equal  what's coming  up  from  the  surface  of  the  Earth. This  especially  equal  that the  amount  that  is coming  down  into  the  Earth, so  is  going  out  of  the  Earth, the  two,  but  you  just  have more  fluxes  of  energy  moving around  and  everything  is hotter  than  it  was  before. That's  the  way  the  greenhouse  gas  Et works.  Questions. So  obviously  when  you  just like  how  lots  of  arrows  and  lines, I  think  I  think  what  this  time is  that  I  used  a  lot  of blue  and  red  think. Okay,  so  this  is, that's  just  talking  about  CO  two. It's  not  all  CO  two. This  is  getting  to  the  question  on how  different  gases  absorb  radiation. So  let  me  start  with  the  black  body. Here  is  actually  the  theoretical  spectrum of  light  that  would  come out  of  something  as  hot  as  the  sun. If  it  were  not  actually  the  sun, but  what's  called  a  black  body. That's  black  body  radiation at  the  tint  of  sun. What  actually  comes  out  of  the  sun  is merely  that  physics  force. The  yellow  is  what's  actually  coming  out  of the  sun  to  the  top  of  the  atmosphere. And  then  a  bunch  of  that  is  absorbed if  you  look  at  what's  causing  a  bunch of  these  differences  between  what's. At  the  top  of  the  atmosphere  versus what's  at  the  radiation, at  sea  level,  it's  water. That  CO  two  is  actually  a  very  small  chunk. Then  it  makes  you  wonder,  well, how  is  it  that  CO two  is  causing  global  warming? If  CO  two  is  so  bad  at, take  energy  reading, so  those  are  lens  for  two  in  water. And  Fermi  saying  that  that's  like  yeah, so  what  this  is  actually  telling  you is  a  bunch  of  different  wavelengths  of  light come  down  from  the  sun  and not  all  the  reach  to the  surface  of  the  Earth, which  is  actually  a  little  bit  different  from the  that  we're  talking  about  with  sciple. It  means  that,  for  example, you  know,  the  ozone  is  really  port. Why  is  it  important? It's  important  because  some  of the  most  energetic  particles that  come  out  of  the  particles, the  come  out  of  the  sun,  are  absorbed by  ozone  three  before they  ever  get  to  the  source  of  the  Earth. And  that's  why  this  red isn't  all  the  way  up  to  the  yellow. If  it  were  a  way  yellow, all  that  high  energy radiation  would  actually  be  effect. A  bunch  of  radiation  is  up  here. As  you  get  to  the  Hyasons, which  is  lower  frequency  radiation, then  you  have  less  of  the  difference. And  you  also  have  some  of  these, some  other  chemicals  that  are coming  as  the  thing  that's  absorbing  light. It's,  I  want  to  say,  but  yeah. So  tell  me  what  you're  thinking  about. It's,  it's  the  ten  which these  gases  gets  you, have  you,  have  you. It's  like  oxygen  in  the  atmosphere. And  oxygen  is  a  very  sharp  language  here. And  so  means  that  if  you  have, there's  some  light  coming  in  at  footlight. If  you  have  some  blanks, it's  going  to  pass  right  through. If  you  have  other  blanks, then  when  it  hits  that  X  molecule, it  might  just  get  absorbed by  the  oxygen  molecule. Which  basically  means  that  this  is  going  to, it's  going  to,  C  is  going  to  start  moving  up. It's  going  to,  so  it's  going  to  move  margin. It's  going  to  turn that  solaration  and  heat  in  the  atmosphere. But  if  this  different  wavelength, or  go  right  past that,  just  wouldn't  interact. So  it's  not  a  question  of  gas. It's  not  the  gas  is  being  stored, it's  the  solar  radiation  being  absorbed. It  just  is  a  property of  each  different  compound, chemical  compound,  that  it  will absorb  some  wave  lengths  and  not  others. Now  that  it's  important to  us  that  three  absorbs  the  highway  lengths. It's  important  to  climate  change that  CO  two  is  really  good absorbing  the  keep  saying highway  but  frequency. Wavelength  and  frequency.  So  this is  wave  length  and  it's  frequency. So  something  that's  low  wavelength, that  means  the  stuff coming  out  of  the  absorbed  by  three, that  means  asperity  frequency. Those  are  the  energetic  porcless  get  cancer. We're  very  happy  that  those  are  insists. But  when  you  have  the  Earth, the  Earth  is  coming  is  giving our  infrared  infrared  is low  energy  high  wave  length. All  right,  and  CO two  which  is  transparent to  some  of  these  high  energy, low  wavelength  parts  of the  sun  spectrum  is  C  is  opaque. It  absorbs  energy  from the  Earth's  subway  lens. That's  the  start  of  why  matters  for  gas. Because  it's  going  to  ignore the  sun  that's  going  to  capture  the  Earth. The  red  is  essentially  how  well  gas  like absorbs  it  versus  the  yellow, which  is  energy. The  difference  between  the  red  and  yellow, it's  how  much  it's  absorbed. Okay,  So  two, oxygen  is  amazing  at  absorbing  energy. Just  this  particular  wavelength  due  to  is very  good.  This  particular  wavelength. There's  not  actually  that  most  of the  subst  radiation  is  coming  from  over  here. Most  of  the  rest radiation  is  coming  from  here. That's  why  it  matters. There's  the  next  step. So  we've  got  the  CO  two  in  the  atmosphere. It's  capturing  radiation  from  the  Earth. As  a  result  of  that, the  global  air  temperature is  going  to  increase. Let's  not  where  the  F  stops. If  the  air  temperature  increases, that's  going  to  cause  more  water  vapor to  be  in  the  atmosphere. Hotter  air  has  more  capacity  for  water  vapor. Water  vapor  is  then  going  to pick  up  a  bunch  of  these  other wants  here  that  are  also  for, as  a  result  of  that,  you're  going  to  have even  energy  for  the  Earth  being  absorbed. Even  hotter  temperatures  presume causing  more  water  vapor  to go  up  in  the  atmosphere. More  temperatures for  every  ton of  CO  two  that  we've  in  the  atmosphere. A  certain  amount  of water  vapor  also  goes  in  the  atmosphere. But  it  takes  a  little  while  next. So  this  is  what,  this  is part  of  what's  happening  here  as  well. It  takes  a  while  for this  cycle  to  come  into  a  new  equilibrium. Because  it's  going  to require  not  just  that the  CO  two  does  its  thing, but  the  CO  two  by  warming the  atmosphere  causes more  water  page  to  come  in. Which  is  this  thing  goes  into  its  cycle, comes  to  purposes  times. Okay.  Any  other  questions  on  Let me  this  is  fine because  basically  all  I  want  to  do  now is  tell  you  about some  other  terms  that  you're  going  to come  out  of  science  and  that  you're  going  to encounter  and  some  of  the  other  effects. So  we  saw  this  before, this  figure, The  bars  show  what it's  called  radiative  forcing. Radiative  forcing  is  the  total  amount  of additional  downward  radiation  that the  Earth  surface  is  objected to  because  of  the  total at  two  in the  atmosphere  since  predustrial  times. So  take  the  twos  in  the  atmosphere. Those  natural  in  the  atmosphere  was already  producing  a  lot  of  double  radiation. We're  worried  about  that. That's  not  what's  going to  be  included  in  this. Radio  forcing. Radio  forcing  is  the  anthrogenic  piece, it's  the  piece  that  we've  added  to  it. And  what  we've  basically  said  is that  because  of  the, the  atmosphere  and  the cycle  of  water  that  goes  with  it, so  it's  included  in  here. The  surface  of  the  Earth  is  subjected  to about  two  watts  per square  meter  of  additional  energy  Y. There's another  about  one  watt  percent  per  meter. It's  coming  from  CH four  and  a  bunch  of  other  things. In  total  we  end  up  with a  little  over  two  watts  per  per meter  shell  energy  that  was coming  for  another  term le  encounter  is carbon  dioxide  equivalent  carbonoxide. The  largest  piece  of the  puzzle  in  terms  of  what's caused  further  Ming  rehouse  gases and  you  can  see  the  twice. Anything  else.  But  there  are  lots  of other  gases  and  they're  not  small. One  of  the  ways  that  we  deal  with  that, particularly  those  of  us in  climate  change  economics, who  don't  actually  want  to  deal  with the  natural  physics  of  this  all  the  time, is  that  we  turn  everything  into what's  called  a  carbon  dioxide  equivalge. Which  is  what's  the  amount of  carbon  dioxide  that  would  have the  same  effect  that this  other  gas  is  having  to  do  that, we  have  to  be  a  little  bit  careful because  other  gases  like  say  methane, can  be  much  more  powerful  in how  much  radiation  they  absorb,  but  nothing. They're  in  the  atmosphere for  a  lot  less  time. Usually,  when  we're  calculating  carbonoxqp, basically  say  what  is  the, what's  the  total  of radiative  forcing  produced  by that  gas  over  the  course  of 100  years  that  combines? That  might  be  really  effective, but  very  short  lived or  might  be  less  effective. Very  long  lived.  Then  there  are some  gases  like  the  halocarbons, which  are  incredibly  effective  and  incredibly long  lived  for  the  atmosphere. Okay,  so  this  is  the  oxide  in  the  atmosphere. This  is  the  things  going  up  at about  37  gigatons  per  year, and  then  there's  all  the other  greenhouse  gas  gases that  also  contribute  to  this. In  total,  they're  contributing another  40%  or  something. So  a  pretty  significant  chunk  of picture  I  have  from  one  side. Where  is  this  coming  from? Total  match  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions in  terms  of  two  equivalents. Now  two  talent  is about  a  quarter  of it  is  coming  from  electricity  production. So  energy,  about  a  quarter of  it  is  coming  from  land  use  change  that's that  took  at  the  top  and  then  other  pieces. But  about  a  quarter  of it  is  coming  from  industry. About  15%  is  coming  from  transportation, buildings,  and  other  energy, come  up  to  30%  or  so. Okay.  Let  me  time  and  talk about  just  these  graphs  from the  last  APCC  released  a  couple  of  years  ago. And  so  these  are from  the  summary  pulse  makers. These  are  sort  of  the  ten  line  results  that the  climate  science  community wants  everyone  to  know  about. 0.1  they  want  everyone  to  know  about  is  that the  climate  system  was  fairly stayed  until  we  start putting  something  in  the  atmosphere. And  then  how  this  stout does  what  we  thought  it  was  going  to  do. 0.2  they  wanted  everyone  to  know  is  models. One  of  the  best  ways  we  know that  this  is  a  CO  two  effect  is  we create  these  big  competition  Mols  way to  know  something's  happening. Because  you  do  experiments, you  have  a  controlled  Earth  environment and  you  put  in  digital  two  in the  atmosphere  and  you  see  the  effect. That's  not  the  way  we're  actually  doing, the  way  we  do  things,  experiments in  computer  models. But  the  fun  thing is  if  you  do those  experiments  in  external  models and  include  all  of the  natural  things  that happen  other  than  humans, this  is  the  tempatures  they  would  experience. If  you  just  include  a  little  things that  we  have  actually  been  doing, then  you  get  observed  temperatures, at  least  within  the  context of  the  experiments  we  can  do  on  Mols. This  is  exactly  consistent with  the  idea  that  cause  that  change. I  think  you  all  agree that  that's  0.2  that  they  want  to, 0.3  that  they  want  to  make is  temperature  change  across the  globe  is  not uniform  but  it's  fairly  smooth. You're  the  highest  in  changes  on  land, that's  why  you  see  land  surfaces coming  out  of  dark  red  and  there  the  poles, but  it's  fairly  smooth  and that  everywhere  is  not. So  recitation  is  0.4  that  they  want  to  make. This  is  different  levels  of  war. 1.5  degrees,  two  degrees,  four  degrees. You  can  see  that  there  are  some  areas that  have  tons  more  water, areas  in  flue,  some  areas that  have  less  water. These  are  pretty  significant  changes, places  that  are  getting  fixtures  more  or less  water  than  the  Nero  globally. The  amount  of  precipitation that's  happening  because  of climate  change  is  increasing. It's  happening  because  there's more  energy  in  the  system that's  causing  more  evaporation. Ation  means  water  has  to  fall, but  that  local  statement is  not  very  reflective of  what's  happening  in  different  areas. There  are  lots  of  places  across the  globe  that  are  not  experiencing general  increases  in  places  that  are experiencing  drying.  The  reasons  for  that. It's  also  important  to  us  other than  the  fact  that  it is  spatially  energy  compared to  what  we  see  at  the  tension. I'm  going  to  skip. Well,  I'll  talk  more  about scenarios  next  time, but  let  me  just  tell you  just  these  four different  these  different scenarios  of  global  warming. From  a  high  mitigation  scenario, SSP  119,  to  a  high  emission  scenario,  SP  585. And  then  we  can  look  at  some  of the  things  that those  different  scenarios  will  do. So  here  we  have what's  expected  to  happen  with September  Arctic  sea  ice. So  that's  the, September  is  when  you  have the  least  sea  ice  across  the  Arctic. And  basically  we  have  past  2050, an  ice  free  Arctic  in, in  September  for  some  time  of the  year  under  about  half  of the  stars  and  it's just  the  two  cooler  stars that  continue  ice  event. The  ocean  surface  is dropping  the  ocean  acidification. It  stabilized  somewhat  under these  high  mitigation  scenarios, dropping  precoiation  scenarios  mean sea  level  rise  change  is. There's  a  lot  less  difference here  between  the  different  scenarios. But  they  included,  you're pushing  really  hard,  people  science. We're  pushing  really  hard  That  they include  not just  what's  most  likely  to  happen, but  what's  within  the  realm  of plusibility  to include  this  low  retining  act  story  line. Which  is  basically  what  would  happen  if certain  processes  of  ice  that  we  don't  know, we  don't  understand  very  well. So  we  don't  know  technly, how  likely  they  are  not  end  up being  much  more  profusi releasing  water  than  otherwise. And  if  you  follow  that  out, then  by  so  by  2,100  you have  almost  meter  sea  level  rise in  the  highs  scenario, almost  2  meters  in the  low  probability  scenario. By  2,300  you  have basically  around  4  meters  of level  rise  to  like 20  meters  of  Ce  level  rise in  the,  in  the  high.
