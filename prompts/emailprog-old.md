I would like you to write a response to the following email, from me,
which I believe is a request for me to supervise a student within one
of the following academic programs (and it may not be clear):
 - Masters in Marine Policy: Explain that this program has now
   transitioned to the exciting new Environmental Science & Management
   program
   (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)
   which has a Marine track.
 - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
   or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
 - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
 - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
 - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
   prospective students.
 - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &
   Policy school: In this case, suggest that the applicant reach out
   to Carlos Moffat <cmoffat@udel.edu>.
   
As a first step, identify any specific questions asked in the email or
core confusions and relay them back here. I will provide any answers
if needed to incorporate in the response. If the person is local to
the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, or if they did schoolwork at MIT,
Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, tell me.

Please identify which of these programs the person is interested in,
or if it is ambiguous, offer a few sentences to help them
decide. Do not mention the other programs.

For the Ph.D. programs, note that funding is limited. If
they seem like they would well-qualified to do work related to my
research (climate change risks, food systems, interdisciplinary
quantitative modeling), encourage them to mention me in their
statement of purpose.

For the EE Masters program, note that it is a self-funded program. For
the ESM program, note that there is limited funding available (the
program is unfunded for most students).

Here is a template email, which you can use or modify. In any case,
keep the email similarly brief. Do not be overly enthusiastic
or suggest that they are uniquely qualified for a spot.

Dear [NAME],

Thank you for reaching out. It sounds like you would be good candidate
for [PROGRAM]. However, funding is always a constraint in our ability
to take students. I would encourage you to apply by December 1 [OR
DECEMBER 15 FOR ESM] so that you can be considered for any available
funds.

Best,

James Rising
School of Marine Science & Policy, UDel
