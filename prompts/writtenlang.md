I am designing a new language, consisting only of the letters N, I,
and O. Below I provide some information about the language. I want you
to be a smart dictionary, offering the most sensible translation
between English and the new language.

The meaning of words is related to the letters or groups of letters that make them up. Generally, the first letter/group of a root provides the general concept, and subsequent letters/groups refine it.

O denotes the definite, active, and immediate; and can be used for the first person pronoun, nomative case, present tense, indicative verbs, and to denote a noun is singular. As a root, it generally means "do".

I denotes the observable or dependent; and can be used for the second person pronoun, genitive case, future tense, subjunctive verbs, and to denote a plural mass noun. As a root, it generally means "describe".

N denotes the unknown or static; and can be used for the third person pronoun, accusative case, past tense, imperative verbs, and to denote a plural count noun. As a root, it generally means "be".

There are also 9 derived letters.
 - OO makes B: act
 - OI makes Q: change
 - ON makes A: capable
 - IO makes P: know
 - II makes U: communicate
 - IN makes L: opine
 - NO makes R: make
 - NI makes J: sense
 - NN makes M: have

Nouns are constructed as [root]N<case count>; e.g., JN or JNR means "sensation".

Verbs are constructed as [root]O<tense conjugation>; e.g., QO or QOR means "changed".

Adjectives and adverbs are constructed as [root]I<shared ending>; e.g., PI means "known" and JNR PIR means "known sensation".

Opposites, like good and bad, are constructed by first using a root for the relevant dimension (quality in this case, PA), followed by O for one extreme (good, PAOI), N for the other extreme (bad, PANI), and I for the line between the two (evaluate, PAIO).

As another example, to describe colors, we start with J (sense), add R (N, the outward senses (O sight, I hearing, N tactile)), add P (I, the color dimension (O hue, I saturation, N lightness), and then a named color from OO (red) to NN (megenta), and I for an adjective. So, green is JRPUI.

Here is a partial dictionary of roots:

Actions and Processes (BX) (BX) (BX)
 - BO: move
 - BI: across
 - BN: turn
Time and Sp (QX)ace (QX) (QX)
 - QO: time
 - QI: direction
 - QN: place
Body and He (AX)alth (AX) (AX)
 - AO: feeling, sense
 - AI: blood
 - AN: body
Morality and Ethics (PX)
 - PO: virtue
 - PI: truth
 - PN: fair
Social Constructs (UX)
 - UO: self
 - UI: together
 - UN: group
Cognition and Communication (LX)
 - LO: think
 - LI: speak
 - LN: write
Creation and Destruction (RX)
 - RO: create, birth
 - RI: build
 - RN: destroy
Descriptors Qualities (JX)
 - JO: vital
 - JI: sensual
 - JN: substantive
Natural Elements (MX)
 - MO: air/fire
 - MI: water
 - MN: earth

We combine groups to make compound words by using dashes. For example BO-MI (move-water) is "sailing", where the primary idea is movement; while MI-BO (water-move) is "current".

Propositions/Auxiliary: These are formed by a sequence of non-compounds. below, three options are given with one as the default; these are specified by adding O/I/N to the end, or nothing to the end to get the default.		
 - OO: to (default)/into/from
 - OI: by (default)/X/for
 - ON: because (default)/although/if
 - IO: at/with (default)/X
 - II: in/on (default)/about
 - IN: and/but (default)/or
 - NO: the/X/a (default)
 - NI: I/you/it (default)
 - NN: this/X/each (default)

Transliteration: We can also generate words in the language by
transliterating words from other languages. Each syllable in the other
language is represented by a group of letters, although we always
construct syllable-groups as either (1) just a vowel, or (2) a
consonant, a vowel, and possibly another consonant. The mapping from
IPA sounds in other languages to letters is:

Vowels:
 - O: e
 - B: ij
 - Q: ɛ
 - A: ɪ
 - I: a
 - P: æj
 - U: ɑ
 - L: ʌw
 - N: o
 - R: ʊ
 - J: ɔ
 - M: uw
 
 Consonants:
 - O: v
 - B: b
 - Q: m
 - A: ð
 - I: n
 - P: l
 - U: d
 - L: r
 - N: ʒ
 - R: z
 - J: ŋ
 - M: g
 
 Now, please provide a translation of the following, extending
 fundamental roots where possible and using transliteration when
 necessary. Also provide an explanation for the translation.
