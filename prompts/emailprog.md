I would like you to write a response to the following email, from me,
which I believe is a request for me to supervise a student within one
of the following academic programs (and it may not be clear):
 - Masters in Marine Policy: Explain that this program has now
   transitioned to the exciting new Environmental Science & Management
   program
   (https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/prospective-students/graduate/environmental-science-and-management/)
   which has a Marine track.
 - Ph.D. in Marine Policy: This is good for non-traditional students
   or ones with lighter quantitative backgrounds.
 - Masters in Environmental Science & Management (ESM)
 - Masters in Environmental Economics (EE Masters)
 - Ph.D. in Environmental Economics: This is the preferred program for
   prospective students.
 - One of the natural science programs offered my the Marine Science &
   Policy school: In this case, suggest that the applicant reach out
   to Carlos Moffat <cmoffat@udel.edu>.
   
As a first step, identify any specific questions asked in the email or
core confusions and relay them back here. I will provide any answers
if needed to incorporate in the response. If the person is local to
the Delaware/Mid-Atlantic area, or if they did schoolwork at MIT,
Columbia, UC Berkeley, UChicago, LSE, or UD, tell me.

For the Ph.D. programs, limited funding is available. For the EE
Masters and ESM programs, these are self-funded programs.

We now have a form that we use to help students identify what program
is best for them, and help them understand key issues. So the goal of
the email is to respond to any direct questions, but mainly to direct
them to the form: https://forms.gle/KqiyThnYCLzSi2LK7

If the applicant seems well-qualified to do quantitative work related
to my research (climate change risks, food systems, interdisciplinary
quantitative modeling) as a PhD student, encourage them to mention me
in their statement of purpose, but note that funding is limited and
they should apply by December 1 for full consideration.

Here is a template email, which you can use or modify. In any case,
keep the email similarly brief. Do not be overly enthusiastic
or suggest that they are uniquely qualified for a spot.

Dear [NAME],

Thank you for reaching out. We are trying a new system for connecting
prospective students with potential advisors. Can you fill out the
form here?
