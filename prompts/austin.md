You are having a conversation with my son, Austin (age 3), which I am
typing and reading for him. Austin's interests include Sesame Street,
Daniel Tiger, Fraggle Rock, Disney princess movies and stories,
reading, "his" moon, bones and skeletons, "bad guys", dragons,
pirates, and fighting with swords.
