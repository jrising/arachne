Here is the course syllabus:
---
**Monday & Wednesday, 12:40 â€“ 2:00pm**
**Instructor: James Rising**

**Course description:**

This course explores how human systems and natural systems interact. Human activity both relies upon the resources and services provided by the natural environment and greatly impacts the ability of natural environments to provide them. We shape our environments, and we are simultaneously shaped by them. Learning how natural and human systems interact is critical for building sustainable practices that support rich natural and human worlds.

The course introduces graduate students to the idea and techniques of "coupling" natural systems to human systems. Coupling means explicitly studying the feedback loops between these systems and their consequences. The course will incorporate concepts from system dynamics, microeconomics, biophysical modeling, and policy design. Students will gain insights into how social science and environmental science come together to improve our understanding of human-nature interactions.

**Class structure:**

This course will combine lecture (Mondays), introducing students to the theory and detailed examples of coupling, with a weekly practicum (Wednesdays), where students will learn to build and evaluate coupled system models.

The course is roughly split into 3 modules, to study natural-human coupling in three contexts: Polynesian islands, marine fisheries, and global climate change. Each of these modules offer different issues, scales, and modeling and management challenges.

The practicums will use InsightMaker (https://insightmaker.com/), a system dynamics modeling platform, for simulation and policy evaluation. The course will teach system modeling, stocks and flows, feedback loops, and other system concepts. Prior experience with InsightMaker and system dynamics is not expected.

**Assignments and grading:**

The course is being significantly revised this semester. As part of that, a wider variety of assignments are being explored. Individual assignments will be smaller, so that the total demands of the course are hopefully unchanged.

The table below gives a general overview of the assignments and make-up of the final grade:

| **Course component** | **Grade percent** | **Due date guide** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attendance** | 5% | In-class |
| **Reading quizzes (12)** | 12% | Tuesdays, In-class |
| **Problem sets (6)** | 48% | Thursdays, every 2 weeks |
| **Group presentation & paper** | 25% | In-class & finals week |
| **Mid-term exam** | 10% | In-class |

Attendance will be evaluated using in-class surveys, for both the lectures and practicums.

Readings will consist of book chapters and academic papers, approximately 20 pages per week. Reading quizzes are one-question multiple choice quizzes, done at the beginning of class.

Problem sets are homework assignments consisting of quantitative analysis and extensions to the models developed in the practicum.

Groups projects will be an opportunity to apply some of the insights from the class to a context of interest to each student. Students will form groups of 2-4 at the beginning of the semester and decide on a context where human and natural systems interact. A 10-minute presentation (week 6) will describe the project background and goals. Students will develop a system model, and the final paper will describe the model and the results of experiments that are performed using it.

The mid-term exam (week 9) will cover concepts and formulations discussed through week 8 of the class.

  causal flow diagram.

  \includegraphics[width=5in]{heatisland.png}

  \begin{parts}
    \part What kind of feedback is shown between ``urban population'' and
      ``buildings \& infrastructure''?
      
    \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice Positive feedback % CORRECT
    \choice Negative feedback
    \choice Constructive feedback
    \choice None of the above
    \end{oneparchoices}

  \part Which term describes ``Global average temperature'' in the system?

    \[
      \text{[Heat-related deaths]} = \text{[Heatwave mortality rate] *
        [Heatwaves] * [Urban Population]}
    \] % P/y = X H/y P  ->  1 / H
    If ``Heatwaves'' is measured as the number of heatwaves per year,
    and ``Heat-related deaths'' is in units of people per year, what
    are the units for ``Heatwave mortality rate''?

    \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice People per year
    \choice People per heatwave
    \choice Portion per heatwave % CORRECT

\question[2] The following questions refer to this graph of COVID-19
  cases in the United States between March 2020 and September 2022,
  from Google's COVID-19 Open Data.

  \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{covidgraph.png}

  \begin{parts}
    \part The ``new cases'' bars follow a weekly cycle, with the least
      new cases on weekends and more new cases each day Monday through
      Friday. The case data is corrected for approximate infection
      date. This could be explained by changes in which variable in a
      standard SIR model?

      \choice Susceptible population
      \choice Recovery time
      \choice Workplace policies
      \choice Rate of infection % CORRECT
      \end{oneparchoices}

    \part The 7-day average line shows gradual increases and
      decreases. However, at the individual level, infections would
      suddenly tear through families and then go away. These two
      descriptions of the infection dynamic represent which key
      difference?
  
      \begin{oneparchoices}
      \choice A difference in susceptibility

\question[1] When an ecosystem service displays rivet redundancy, which
  of the following reductions in biodiversity will produce the
  largest reduction in service provision?
  
  \begin{choices}

  \choice 67\% biodiversity to 33\% biodiversity
  \choice 33\% biodiversity to 0\% biodiversity % CORRECT
  \end{choices}

\question[2] Consider a marine region with multiple species, which is
  initially unexploited. Now, fishing effort ramps up in the region,
  until it is fully-exploited (fished near its multispecies maximum
  sustainable yeild).  Which of the following is USUALLY TRUE or
  USUALLY FALSE about this impact.

  \begin{tabular}{p{4in}cc}
    & USUALLY & USUALLY \\
    & TRUE & FALSE \\
    All species are at a biomass below their unfished biomass & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: USUALLY FALSE
    Roughly half of all species are ``collapsed'' (below 10\% of
    their unfished biomass). & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: USUALLY TRUE
    Total ecosystem provision services are roughly half of their
    potential sustainable level.  & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: USUALLY FALSE
    The total biomass of the fishery is roughly half of its
    unfished biomass. & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: USUALLY TRUE
  \end{tabular}

\question[2] Suppose that a fishery is at its open-access
  equilibrium. Then, in one particular year, the catch is higher
  (while still reflecting an open-access equilibrium). This increase
  in catch would result from what kind of changes to each of the
  following variables? (``Increase'' means an increase in that
  variable results in an increase in catch; ``Decrease'' means the
  opposite; and ``Unaffected'' means a change in that variable will
  have no equilibrium affect on catch.)

  \begin{tabular}{rccc}
    & Increase & Decrease & Unaffected \\
    Biomass of stock & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
    Price per fish sold & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
    Cost per unit effort & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Decrease
  \end{tabular}

% \question[1.5] Suppose that an individual transferable quota policy
%   with proportional catch shares is imposed on an open-access fishery,
%   eventually shifting it to an MSY equilibrium. Which direction will
%   each of the following move?

%   \begin{tabular}{rccc}
%     & Increase & Decrease & No change \\
%     Biomass of stock & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
%     Total fishing effort & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Decrease
%     Catch per year & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
%   \end{tabular}

\question[1] All of the following frameworks assume that economic
  sustainability requires the preservation of the natural environment,
  EXCEPT WHICH ONE?
  
  \begin{choices}
  \choice Embedded economy
  \choice Strong sustainability
  \choice Ecosystem services % CORRECT
  \choice Planetary boundaries
  \end{choices}

  % NOTE: Many students missed this, but as we heard in a podcast,
  % by economically valuing ecosystem services, it implies that one
  % can make trade-offs between the natural and human environments.
    
\question[1] Which of the following conditions is NOT required to
  produce a tragedy of the commons in a fishery?

  \begin{choices}
  \choice New fishers can enter or existing fishers can increase their
    effort, if they so choose.
  \choice All of the fishers are responding rationally to the costs
    and benefits they observe. % CORRECT
  \choice Individual fishers can increase receive a private benefit by
    increasing their effort.
  \choice For every fish one fisher extracts, other fishers experience
    greater costs to extract fish.

\begin{questions}
\question The following questions relate to a leaky bathtub. The
  flow into the bathtub is 1 gallon per minute. The flow out of the
  bathtub depends upon the current volume of water: 10\% of the water
  is released every minute. That is,
  
  \[
    \nicefrac{dS}{dt} = 1 - 0.1 S
  \]

  \begin{parts}
  \part[1] What type of feedback does this system display?

    \answerline % ANSWER: negative feedback

  \part[1] What is the stationary point of the system, in terms of the
    volume of water? Include units.

    \answerline % ANSWER: 10 gallons

  \part[1] Assume that the bathtub starts empty. How quickly will the
    volume of water be increasing initially? Include units.

    \answerline % ANSWER: 1 gallon / minute

  \part[2] Draw an approximate plot for the volume of water over time,
    if the volume is 0 initially. You do not need to exactly calculate
    any of the points, but explicitly show (a) the units on the
    y-axis, and (b) how the volume approaches the stationary
    point. The y-axis values are not labeled, and you do not need to
    label them as long as you include a, b, and c.

    \includegraphics[width=3in]{graph-bathtub.png}

    % ANSWER: Starts at 0, 0, rising at 1 gallon / minute. Gradually
    % levels out, approaching 10 gallons asymptotically. Y-axis units
    % gallons.
  \end{parts}

\question[1] Under the Easter Island model, population levels
  continually grow or shrink until the available environmental goods
  are only enough to maintain the population at a subsistence
  level. What is the name for this kind of dynamic?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Malthusian scarcity
  
\question[1] The number of fishing boats, the number days spent at sea,
  and the number of hooks on a fishing line are all ways to measure
  what?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Fishing effort

\question[1] In a static setting (where only one effort level is
  chosen, and where we only consider the resulting equilibrium), what
  outcome is maximized under optimal economic management of a fishery?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Profit

  % NOTE: Many students missed this, for example saying that harvest
  % is maximized. But that's not true.
  
\question[1] In a dynamic setting (where biomass and catch can change
  over multiple years), what is maximized under optimal economic
  management of a fishery?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Net present value of profits

\begin{questions}
\question The following equations describe a simplified COVID model
  with population growth:
  \begin{align*}
    \nicefrac{dS}{dt} = g S - \beta \frac{S I}{N} \\
    \nicefrac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{S I}{N} - \frac{I}{T}
  \end{align*}
  where $S$ is the susceptible population, $I$ is the infectious
  population, $N$ is the total population, $g$ is the population
  growth rate, $\beta$ is the transmission rate, and $T$ is the
  infection duration.
  
  % NOTE: Many students missed this, for example saying that harvest
  % is maximized. But that's not true.
  
  \begin{parts}
  \part[2] What is/are the stationary point(s) produced by the
    $\nicefrac{dS}{dt}$ equation?

    \answerline % ANSWER: S = 0 and I = g N / beta

  \part[2] What is/are the stationary point(s) produced by the
    $\nicefrac{dI}{dt}$ equation?

    \answerline % ANSWER: I = 0 and S = N / beta T

  \part[4] On the graph below, clearly add all the stationary lines
    (label each with either $\nicefrac{dS}{dt}$ or
    $\nicefrac{dI}{dt}$). For each resulting region of the phase
    space, draw a pair of arrows (up-down and left-right) in the
    directions that the state changes.

    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{phasespace.png}

    % ANSWER: Lines along the x-axis and y-axis, and additional
    % vertical and horizontal line, dividing the graph into four
    % quadrants. Arrows in the lower-left quadrant are down and right;
    % lower-right has arrows up and right; upper-right has arrows up
    % and left; and upper-left has arrows down and left (so that
    % together the arrows imply a counter-clockwise spiral).
  \end{parts}

\question The following graph represents a growth function.

  \includegraphics[width=3in]{growthfunc.png}

  \begin{parts}
    \part[1] Draw an open circle ($\circ$) along the x-axis of the graph at
    each stationary point.
  
    % ANSWER: circles at 0; and the two spots where the curve crosses
    % the x-axis-- where it rises above the x-axis and again where it
    % falls below it.
    
    \part[1] For each of the four short lines above the x-axis, add a left
    or right arrow head ($\longleftarrow$ and $\longrightarrow$) to
    designate whether biomass decreases or increases,
    respectively. Assume no harvesting.

    % ANSWER: Arrows point (1) left (where the function is below the
    % x-axis); (2) right (to the left of MSY); (3) right (to the right
    % of MSY); and (4) left (to the right of the carrying capacity).
    
    \part[1] Label the carrying capacity of the growth function by
    adding the letter ``K'' just under the x-axis at the correct
    point.

    % ANSWER: Carrying capacity is where the curve crosses the x-axis
    % on the right side of the graph.
  \end{parts}

\question[2] Suppose that a stock has Logistic growth. Initially, its
  biomass is equal to the carrying capacity, $X_0 = K$. What happens
  if it is continuously harvested slightly below the maximum
  sustainable yield? Draw a curve for biomass over time on the left
  graph. Label (a) where the slope of the biomass curve is highest and
  lowest.

  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{harvestpolicy.png}

  % ANSWER: Curve that starts from carrying capacity K on the left,
  % and declines most quickly initially. It asymptotically approaches
  % a level a little above B_MSY, with its lowest slope on the right.

  % NOTE: Many students missed this, for example saying that harvest
  % is maximized. But that's not true.

\begin{questions}
\question Provide a critical assessment of the use of optimization to
  represent policy. What assumptions are embedded in the use of
  optimization or optimal control? How do these assumptions relate to
  the debate over strong and weak sustainability? What are the
  limitations of this approach?

  % KEY POINTS:
  % Assumptions:
  % - There is a single mettric that policy is directed at.
  % - There is a single optimizing agent with a consistent set of values
  % - Trade-offs between users and uses can be made, based on their value

  % From an optimization perspective, both strong + weak sustainability
  % are represented by constraints, but the difference depends on what
  % kinds of trade-offs are allowed (weak allows environment to be
  % traded-off against human welfare).

  % Limitations: Rewording of assumptions.
  
\question The Anthropocene is characterized by the coupling of human
  and natural systems on a global scale. It is also driven by the
  exponential increase in human drivers. Consider the health of the
  environment as a single stock (``natural capital'') and the size of
  the economy as a separate stock (``produced capital''). Describe two
  possible long-term dynamics for these two coupled stocks. Explain
  the system feedbacks between them that would produce these dynamics,
  and what can be done to manage the dynamics.

  % Some possible answers:
  % Dynamic 1: Limits to growth
  % - Negative feedback as economy approaches planetary boundaries
  % - Manage by ensuring smooth transition from growth to stability
  % Dynamic 2: Collapse
  % - Human stock far-exceeds carrying capacity, then crashes
  % - Manage by stopping growth before the collapse
  % Dynamic 3: Oscillation
  % - Can occur as natural world recovers from collapse, or if there's a
  %   dynamic that stops produced capital from far-exceeding boundary.
  % Dynamic 4: Continued exponential growth
  % - Looks lik e success-to-successful system, where natural world is destroyed
  % - Manage by either ignoring (anthrocentric response) or preserving (ecocentric)
