Here is the course syllabus:
---
**Tuesday & Thursday, 11:10 â€“ 12:30pm**
**Instructor: James Rising**

**Course description:**

This course explores how human systems and natural systems interact. Human activity both relies upon the resources and services provided by the natural environment and greatly impacts the ability of natural environments to provide them. We shape our environments, and we are simultaneously shaped by them. Learning how natural and human systems interact is critical for building sustainable practices that support rich natural and human worlds.

The course introduces graduate students to the idea and techniques of "coupling" natural systems to human systems. Coupling means explicitly studying the feedback loops between these systems and their consequences. The course will incorporate concepts from system dynamics, microeconomics, biophysical modeling, and policy design. Students will gain insights into how social science and environmental science come together to improve our understanding of human-nature interactions.

**Class structure:**

This course will combine lecture (Tuesdays), introducing students to the theory and detailed examples of coupling, with a weekly practicum (Thursdays), where students will learn to build and evaluate coupled system models.

The course is roughly split into 3 modules, to study natural-human coupling in three contexts: Polynesian islands, marine fisheries, and global climate change. Each of these modules offer different issues, scales, and modeling and management challenges.

The practicums will use InsightMaker (https://insightmaker.com/), a system dynamics modeling platform, for simulation and policy evaluation. The course will teach system modeling, stocks and flows, feedback loops, and other system concepts. Prior experience with InsightMaker and system dynamics is not expected.

**Assignments and grading:**

The course is being significantly revised this semester. As part of that, a wider variety of assignments are being explored. Individual assignments will be smaller, so that the total demands of the course are hopefully unchanged.

The table below gives a general overview of the assignments and make-up of the final grade:

| **Course component** | **Grade percent** | **Due date guide** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attendance** | 5% | In-class |
| **Reading quizzes (12)** | 12% | Tuesdays, In-class |
| **Problem sets (6)** | 48% | Thursdays, every 2 weeks |
| **Group presentation & paper** | 25% | In-class & finals week |
| **Mid-term exam** | 10% | In-class |

Attendance will be evaluated using in-class surveys, for both the lectures and practicums.

Readings will consist of book chapters and academic papers, approximately 20 pages per week. Reading quizzes are one-question multiple choice quizzes, done at the beginning of class.

Problem sets are homework assignments consisting of quantitative analysis and extensions to the models developed in the practicum.

Groups projects will be an opportunity to apply some of the insights from the class to a context of interest to each student. Students will form groups of 2-4 at the beginning of the semester and decide on a context where human and natural systems interact. A 10-minute presentation (week 6) will describe the project background and goals. Students will develop a system model, and the final paper will describe the model and the results of experiments that are performed using it.

The mid-term exam (week 9) will cover concepts and formulations discussed through week 8 of the class.

\section{Question Set 1: multiple choice.}\hfill (25\%)\\

\begin{questions}
  \question[2] Identify whether each of the following is a stock or a
  flow (as we have encountered them), with a check-mark in the correct
  box.
  
  \begin{tabular}{rcc}
    & Stock & Flow \\
    Groundwater levels & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Stock
    New COVID infections & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Flow
    Rabbits eaten by foxes & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Flow
    Spawning biomass & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Stock
  \end{tabular}

\question[3] The following questions relate to the following heat island
  causal flow diagram.

  \includegraphics[width=5in]{heatisland.png}

  \begin{parts}
    \part What kind of feedback is shown between ``urban population'' and
      ``buildings \& infrastructure''?
      
    \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice Positive feedback % CORRECT
    \choice Negative feedback
    \choice Constructive feedback
    \choice None of the above
    \end{oneparchoices}

  \part Which term describes ``climate change'' in the system?

    \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice Endogenous variable
    \choice Exogenous variable % CORRECT
    \choice Flow variable
    \choice All of the above
    \end{oneparchoices}

  \part Suppose ``heat-related deaths'' is calculated as:
    \[
      \text{[Heat-related deaths]} = \text{[Heatwave mortality rate] *
        [Heatwaves] * [Urban Population]}
    \] % P/y = X H/y P  ->  1 / H
    If ``Heatwaves'' is measured as the number of heatwaves per year,
    and ``Heat-related deaths'' is in units of people per year, what
    are the units for ``Heatwave mortality rate''?

    \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice People per year
    \choice People per heatwave
    \choice Portion per heatwave % CORRECT
    \choice Portion per year
    \end{oneparchoices}
  \end{parts}

\question[1] On Easter Island, most locations around the island
  experienced multiple waves of deforestation and re-growth, even as
  the average tree density decreased smoothly. Which of the following
  concepts do these facts reflect?

  \begin{choices}
  \choice Carrying capacity
  \choice Scale % CORRECT
  \choice Shifting baselines
  \end{choices}

	% NOTE: Many students missed this, presumably not
	understanding that at a high resolution, things look different
	than when the whole Easter Island is aggregated.
	
\question[1] When an ecosystem service displays rivet redundancy, which
  of the following reductions in biodiversity will produce the
  largest reduction in service provision?
  
  \begin{choices}
  \choice 100\% biodiversity to 67\% biodiversity
  \choice 67\% biodiversity to 33\% biodiversity
  \choice 33\% biodiversity to 0\% biodiversity % CORRECT
  \end{choices}

\question[1] Which of the following is NOT true about a region managed at
  its multi-species maximum sustainable yield?

  \begin{choices}
  \choice Roughly half of all species are reduced to below 10\% of
    their unfished biomass.
  \choice The total biomass of the fishery is roughly half of its
    unfished biomass.
  \choice The annual biomass caught in the fishery is roughly half of
    its full potential. % CORRECT
  \end{choices}

	% NOTE: Many students missed this, but the annual biomass caught
	it at the peak of its potential-- that's why its the MMSY.

\question[2] Suppose that a fishery is at its open-access
  equilibrium. Then, in one particular year, the catch is higher
  (while still reflecting an open-access equilibrium). This increase
  in catch would result from what kind of changes to each of the
  following variables? (``Increase'' means an increase in that
  variable results in an increase in catch; ``Decrease'' means the
  opposite; and ``Unaffected'' means a change in that variable will
  have no equilibrium affect on catch.)

  \begin{tabular}{rccc}
    & Increase & Decrease & Unaffected \\
    Biomass of stock & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
    Price per fish sold & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
    Cost per unit effort & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Decrease
    Fisher's discount rate & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Unaffected
  \end{tabular}

\question[1.5] Suppose that a total allowable catch policy is imposed on an
  open-access fishery, eventually shifting it to an MSY
  equilibrium. Which direction will each of the following move?

  \begin{tabular}{rccc}
    & Increase & Decrease & No change \\
    Biomass of stock & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
    Total fishing effort & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Decrease
    Catch per year & $\Box$ & $\Box$ & $\Box$ \\ % ANSWER: Increase
  \end{tabular}

	% NOTE: Many students got 1-2 of these wrong.

\question[1] Which of the following frameworks does NOT assume that
  sustainability requires preservation of the natural environment?
  
  \begin{choices}
  \choice Embedded economy
  \choice Strong sustainability
  \choice Ecosystem services % CORRECT
  \choice Planetary boundaries
  \end{choices}

	% NOTE: Many students missed this, but as we heard in a podcast,
	by economically valuing ecosystem services, it implies that one
	can make trade-offs between the natural and human environments.

\question[1] Fisheries management is aimed at resolving the tragedy of
  the commons. All of the following can be components of a fishery
  policy, but which of the following is the central issue that must be
  addressed to resolve the tragedy of the commons?

  \begin{choices}
  \choice Ensure that new fishers cannot join a fishery when profit is
    available.
  \choice Ensure that an individual fisher cannot increase their
    effort level for private benefit. % CORRECT
  \choice Ensure that the benefits of the fishery are maximized.
  \choice Ensure that fishers can purchase a spatial segment of the
    fishing grounds as their private property.
  \end{choices}
  
  % NOTE: Many students missed this, but the core issue with the
  tragedy of the commons is that people make private decisions that
  undermine public goods.

\section{Question Set 2: fill in the blank.}\hfill (25\%)\\

Answer all questions by filling in the answer on the line.

\begin{questions}
\question The following questions relate to a leaky bathtub. The
  flow into the bathtub is 1 gallon per minute. The flow out of the
  bathtub depends upon the current volume of water: 10\% of the water
  is released every minute. That is,
  
  \[
    \nicefrac{dS}{dt} = 1 - 0.1 S
  \]

  \begin{parts}
  \part[1] What type of feedback does this system display?

    \answerline % ANSWER: negative feedback

  \part[1] What is the stationary point of the system, in terms of the volume of water?

    \answerline % ANSWER: 10 gallons
    
  \part[3] Draw an approximate plot for the volume of water over time, if
    the volume is 0 initially. You do not need to exactly calculate
    any of the points, but explicitly show (a) the units on the
    y-axis, (b) the slope of the your curve at time 0, and (c) how the
    volume approaches the stationary point. The y-axis values are not
    labeled, and you do not need to label them as long as you include
    a, b, and c.

    \includegraphics[width=3in]{graph-bathtub.png}

    % ANSWER: Starts at 0, 0, rising at 1 gallon / minute. Gradually
    % levels out, approaching 10 gallons asymptotically. Y-axis units
    % gallons.
  \end{parts}

\question[1] Under the Easter Island model, population levels increase
  until the available environmental goods are only enough to maintain
  a subsistence population (or less than this level). What is the name
  for this kind of dynamic?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Malthusian scarcity
  
\question[1] The number of fishing boats, the number days spent at sea,
  and the number of hooks on a fishing line are all ways to measure
  what?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Fishing effort

\question[1] In a static setting (where only one effort level is chosen,
  and where we only consider the resulting equilibrium), what is
  maximized under optimal economic management of a fishery?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Profit

\question[1] In a dynamic setting (where biomass and catch can change
  over multiple years), what is maximized under optimal economic
  management of a fishery?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Net present value of profits
  
  % NOTE: Many students missed this, for example saying that harvest
  is maximized. But that's not true.

\question[1] What is the name for a relationship between environmental
  degradation and income, where degradation initially increases within
  income levels but eventually decreases at high incomes?

  \answerline % ANSWER: Environmental Kuznets Curve
  
\end{questions}

\section{Question Set 3: labeling graphs.}\hfill (25\%)\\

Answer all questions by filling in the answer in the space provided.

\setlength\answerlinelength{6.5in}

\begin{questions}
\question The following equations describe a simplified COVID model
  with population growth:
  \begin{align*}
    \nicefrac{dS}{dt} = g S - \beta \frac{S I}{N} \\
    \nicefrac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{S I}{N} - \frac{I}{T}
  \end{align*}
  where $S$ is the susceptible population, $I$ is the infectious
  population, $N$ is the total population, $g$ is the population
  growth rate, $\beta$ is the transmission rate, and $T$ is the
  infection duration.
  
  % Stationary?
  % dI/dt: I = 0; beta S / N = 1 / T => S = N / (beta T)
  % dS/dt: S = 0; g = beta I / N => I = g N / beta
  % g = 0.01, beta = 0.2, N = 1000, I = 10
  % S = 500
  % I = 50

  \begin{parts}
  \part[2] What is/are the stationary point(s) produced by the
    $\nicefrac{dS}{dt}$ equation?

    \answerline % ANSWER: S = 0 and I = g N / beta

  \part[2] What is/are the stationary point(s) produced by the
    $\nicefrac{dI}{dt}$ equation?

    \answerline % ANSWER: I = 0 and S = N / beta T

  \part[4] On the graph below, clearly add all the stationary lines
    (label each with either $\nicefrac{dS}{dt}$ or
    $\nicefrac{dI}{dt}$) and up-down and left-right arrows to each
    region of the graph.

    \includegraphics[width=.52\textwidth]{phasespace.png}

    % ANSWER: Lines along the x-axis and y-axis, and additional
    % vertical and horizontal line, dividing the graph into four
    % quadrants. Arrows in the lower-left quadrant are down and right;
    % lower-right has arrows up and right; upper-right has arrows up
    % and left; and upper-left has arrows down and left (so that
    % together the arrows imply a counter-clockwise spiral).
  \end{parts}

\question The following graph represents a growth function.

  \includegraphics[width=3in]{growthfunc.png}

  \begin{parts}
    \part[1] Draw an open circle ($\circ$) along the x-axis of the graph at
    each stationary point.
  
    % ANSWER: circles at 0; and the two spots where the curve crosses
    % the x-axis-- where it rises above the x-axis and again where it
    % falls below it.
    
    \part[1] For each of the four short lines above the x-axis, add a left
    or right arrow head ($\longleftarrow$ and $\longrightarrow$) to
    designate whether biomass decreases or increases,
    respectively. Assume no harvesting.

    % ANSWER: Arrows point (1) left (where the function is below the
    % x-axis); (2) right (to the left of MSY); (3) right (to the right
    % of MSY); and (4) left (to the right of the carrying capacity).
    
    \part[1] Label the carrying capacity of the growth function by
    adding the letter ``K'' just under the x-axis at the correct
    point.

    % ANSWER: Carrying capacity is where the curve crosses the x-axis
    % on the right side of the graph.
  \end{parts}

\question[3] Suppose that a stock has Logistic growth. Initially, its
  biomass is equal to the carrying capacity, $X_0 = K$. What happens
  if it is continuously harvested slightly above the maximum
  sustainable yield? Draw a curve for biomass over time on the left
  graph, and label (a) where the slope of the biomass curve (it's rate
  of falling) is the lowest, and (b) the two areas on the graph where
  the rate approaches its highest value.

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{harvestpolicy.png}

  % ANSWER: The curve starts at K at time = 0 and falls quickly (one
  % location with high slope) before gradually evening out. It never
  % goes horizontal, but nears has its lowest slope where the curve
  % crosses B_MSY. The slope then begins to fall more quickyl as the
  % curve moves away from B_MSY, reaching 0 at the population collapse
  % point.

  % NOTE: Many students missed this, saying that the rate of falling
  is low at the beginning. But when stock is near K, growth is low, so
  the falling rate is high. As you approach MSY, you nearly are able
  to grow as much as the harvest, but not quite.
