Below is a collection of material that I am in the process of
archiving. It starts with a short description, and then the content of
all files (typically generated with 
`find . -print -exec cat {} \; -printf "\n=====\n"`).

I will generally try to provide some context, in addition to the file
content. Please include this in your generated summary.

Please generate a summary document, using twiki syntax:
