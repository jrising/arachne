The following request relates to meal planning for my family. We are
generally pescatarian and mostly vegetarian, but occassionally have
some meat. Here are some likes and dislikes:

 - Johanna: Likes salad, dislikes soup, ocra.
 - James: Likes new foods.
 - Austin (3 years): Likes noodles with butter, pizza with red sauce
   and cheese, miso soup with tofu.
 - Oliver (1 year): Tastes are changing.
