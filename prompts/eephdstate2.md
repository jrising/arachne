Can you summarize these bullet points into a table (adjusting the
responses based on the whole list, if appropriate), with a row for
each applicant (you can just list them as Applicant 1, 2, ...) and the
following columns: Faculty mentions, Research interests, Research
proposal, Quantitative capacity, UD Specificity, Writing Fluency,
Growth, and DEI?

Can you shorten this, in particular the "Research proposal" and
"Quantitative capacity" columns, so that they just use the keywords
mentioned in the original rubric. Here's the rubric, for reference:
 - "Research proposal": Code the research proposal using keywords from the following list to denote the following features, or "No proposal" if no specific research plan is presented.
     - "Interests": Research interests are mentiuoned
     - "Motivated": Compelling motivation for a research agenda
     - "Literature": Reference to existing literature
     - "Methodology": Elements of a relevant methodology
     - "Published": Applicant has relevant published work
 - "Quantitative capacity": Code the the applicant's quantiative skills using keywords from the following list, or "No discussion" if no skills mentioned.
     - "Statistics": Data analysis, statistics, or econometrics
     - "Programming": Programming languages mentioned
     - "Analytical": Analytical model development (Optimization-based or similarly sophisticated)
