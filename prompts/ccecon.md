# Climate Change Economics (MAST 488/688)

## Spring 2024
- **Time**: Tuesdays and Thursday, 3:55 – 5:15pm
- **Location**: Sharp Lab 120 (Newark)

## Instructor Information & Introduction
- **Instructor name**: James Rising <jrising@udel.edu>
- **Office hours**: Robinson 305, Thursdays, 11:30 - 1:30pm or sign up for zoom hours at https://zcal.co/i/yT7oGlwL

## Course Description
This course provides an economics perspective on the major challenges of climate change, discussing economic understanding, current developments, and policy implications across a variety of topics. For MAST 688 students, an advanced treatment including economic theory and methodological approaches. Topics will include climate impacts and adaptation, mitigation pathways, firm behavior, and international coordination problems, with a mix of quantitative models, policy analysis, and hands-on practicums.

**Prerequisites**:
- **MAST 488**: APEC/ECON 343 Environmental Economics or permission of the instructor.
- **MAST 688**: ECON 811 Microeconomic Theory I is recommended.

## Learning Outcomes
Students from both classes will cover shared outcomes, with MAST 688 students engaging in more advanced analysis.

| MAST 488 Outcome | MAST 688 Outcome |
|------------------|------------------|
| Explain the basic science of climate change | Same as MAST 488 |
| Describe the relationship between physical and economic risks | Same as MAST 488 |
| Discuss economic risks and statistical/process approaches | Estimate and project dose-response functions |
| Explain economic and ethical significance of climate policies | Analyze firm-level decision-making and international mitigation challenges |
| Handle data, simulations, and visualizations in R | Same as MAST 488, plus analyze with advanced techniques |
