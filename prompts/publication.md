I have a new publication out! The abstract and other information is
below. I would like to post about this on several forms of social
media. Can you please produce summaries in the following formats:

1. A tweet for Fediscience/Zulip:
500 characters maximum, with a link to the article.

2. A similarly short post on LinkedIn.

3. An HTML block for the OMG lab website:
<div style="overflow: hidden;">

<p><b>Journal article</b>: [AUTHORS, e.g., Rising, J.] ([YEAR]). [ARTICLE TITLE]. <i>[JOURNAL]</i>.</p>
